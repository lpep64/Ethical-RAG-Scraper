I made the original call to preserve Library Genesis because the project's simmering internal conflicts were coming to a head. The [libgen.fun]( fork is the result of that conflict. You pose a good concern worth discussing openly. I try to take a neutral voice on the forks for this exact reason, so I can reply to your comment and give you my neutral but informed take on the situation. * **bookwarrior is the original founder**, and you can see the code he wrote in the original project sourcecode ([ The scitech library is named after him (the *bookwarrior* database). * **bookwarrior's Code of Library Genesis** is inspired by his original vision for the Library Genesis project: devotion to sharing knowledge freely, anti-profit, the survival of the project, and community decision-making. * **Years ago, bookwarrior ceded control of the domains and server to someone,** who has disengaged from the community over time. The website's long-term neglect is pretty obvious to any visitor: there's been almost no recent code development in past years. * **bookwarrior wants to ensure the survival of the original Library Genesis vision**, and continue to develop the platform. The recent IPFS implementation started from his work on [libgen.fun]( \\-- you can see he overhauled the entire php code from scratch. Philosophically, I think his values represent the values of a free library, of a free librarian, and I think of anyone in the world he's the person with the skills, willpower, and vision to see the project into the future. After all, it's his own child. Logistically, [libgen.rs]( and their hard-working librarian team is doing the daily ingestion and basic database maintenance. Their database is fully open and public still, but there's some concern about how long that will last when there's no community decision-making or transparency about the direction of their project (see: Code of Library Genesis. Management Council). As for [libgen.lc]( I removed them from the subreddit dropdown because they began to serve adware popup redirects. That was a clear violation of the community's trust, and the principles of a free, open library (see: Code of Library Genesis. Illegal Profit). These are the general facts laid out. As a community member you can take this info and donate/give-back as you see fit. This is a complex, years-long conflict, but I think it's a really important conversation when planning for the future. There's really only one free library in the world, and there's no other Library Genesis, no other founder, and no other Code. But the future of the vision free library is everyone's hands."}

He received the codes and is still operating these days, but has been steadily deviating from the community which became dependent on him after the lib.rus.ec support ended owing to random factors and later by its commercialization. The community isn't that flexible to respond to everything immediately, and sometimes quick fixes are needed. And this brings in risks. Access was shared for better resilience and reservation. However, it didn't work in the best way. It has always created tension but somewhat worked overall. Domain names, server access, personal storages, etc, everything was occasionally shared for the project good. And LG started from the generous hosting gift with the server administration as mentioned above. Besides, the admins eradicated there now were actually scholars moving around a lot and who were not supposed to deal with maintenance, but had to explore new ways and propagate a word about the library like the present group. The recent story is exactly opposite. A latecomer technical support with ambitions decided that supporting a server makes it his property. People often view the sharing of books as the only criterion for openness, but this is only the surface. None of the forks can stop sharing since it's the point of the project. It's not their virtue, it's what they can't avoid. But every other aspect of LG which actually made LG, has been wiped out for the inability to comprehend what role LG can play when the basics are secured and enough copies are distributed. The forks shamelessly took all the heavy development to themselves (took, not copied!) and only give out what users bring, the books, and records. Hmm... Something is seriously missing here. The forks now fragment the system as they want, and if anyone wants to change the way, it will either carry exploitive character (since no rules,I promises) or the project would need to be started over again. There's literally no continuation. This is a complete stop, invisible outside the community, but sufficiently tragic to start taking actions immediately and treating the former sites as the past background."}

He gained solo control over the project. It didn't stop him to split the project against my will.

It is dedicated to the recovery of my original project. Libgen.lc and multiple its alias domains belong to another individual, the first split admin, who in a similar way captured the entire project by being entrusted communal administration (somebody had to have a server) and have been building connections privately by acting on behalf of LG for long years. When in about 2016 he started getting donations as the only community server, he immediately claimed it was his personal pocket and since then basically split off forever leaving us with the forum and passive mirror only. The recent other split-off a year ago in February 2020 was first planned as a remedy against the first hijacker, but turned out to be another hijacking, now together with the community and against me.

They killed the social model by gradually undercutting its root. The forks drain and capture any resource from LG they can reach out: donations for the library they haven't made (zlibrary have been literally a wallet on top of LG, by now may have collected tens of millions of dollars, libgen.lc $0.5M, libgen.pw/me $1M, ebook.farm/ebookoid in the same range, etc.), contributors (who brings books) who have no idea LG's spirit isn't there any longer and is being repelled from there. They all use disguise, my postings, brand, community, the rules, but only to serve their domination. I took them all without any conditions and now they immortalized themselves without being able to accept anybody else and having banned me from my own project. I'm the only founder and the creator of LG, of its concept and first full implementation, online deployment, community, culture, promotion to get it to the global scene, and defense mechanisms (thanks to the hijackers, I now must expose myself to rescue the project and they help it by occasionally publishing my private interaction with them and blackmailing to do so). > > > In short, I'm trying to revive what was killed during my absence in the project. Yes, I have almost no resource, and what they call LG+forks is now against me, since I break their business model and hostile organization that raptures the project further and further.

In mhut zlibrary freely discuss, what they charge money for etc. And the founder is named the opposite side. Zlibrary's contribution equals zero, pw/me probably was involved in getting some collections, but what they gained from LG is incomparably more. By now it is a hostile fork aiming at ripping more money and do as little as possible. > > > I need my community back, unconditionally, without the hijackers who are banned here and have become personae non gratae. There's much work to do and the society should contribute in full. It should also learn to protect my gift to the world, rather than watch in silence when LG is torn into pieces and stolen in the middle of the day."}

This and shrine's post were quite helpful. Someone mentioned [this post]( earlier. In it bookwarrior takes issue with ZLibrary and their behavior. Going to libgen.fun and searching, I see the main Library Genesis results, but amongst the available forks ZLibrary is listed. How does this work? Who controls the main database? If it is entirely decentralized, won't splintered for profit forks always be an issue? And does that hurt the overall Library Genesis chance of long-term survival against a larger legal push against them? And say, if some \"random\" person had donated to Z Library not only to help, but really to get larger access above 10 books a day, this money didn't actually go to server costs/maintainance? Aren't donations still donations no matter what fork? Or is it primarily an issue with individuals profiting from donations instead of it all going directly towards actual running costs? EDIT: Ok, I found other info about the IPFS system. My questions related to Z Library still stand though. I hope they aren't too inane."}

Being a voluntary endeavor, LG had had no constant people, and it was the norm. The hijackers, though, decided to put it upside-down and claim the ownership (not less) by accusing others in their temporary invocation. The individual is known, though, as well as the \"team\". However, their such operation also shows they can't move on beyond the original model given to them. The time goes and all they do is fight between the forks for domination, while the real problem can only be addressed in the legal domain.

In summary: - all uploading users have no idea what happened and essentially become milked cows since the owner has no rules and keeps showing the older regulations having no relevance to them - the original domain gen.lib.rus.ec was communal and very well known, not needing any promotion or a cold start - the forum is the community, i.e. it is also communal - donations are earned purely by the long-term running project as a brand and as a huge attracting mass, irrelevant to who is now behind. - the working code was available to him, too. It is actually now hidden to inhibit competition. Such an \"open sos\". Now, how come this is a fork? There's nothing essential forked here. It's the same base totally raised by communal efforts with every other admin magically eradicated. Owning LG as a communal result immediately implies stealing. Each of the guys in charge eventually developed into forms of taking and splitting. That's not forking. That's taking. If one wishes to fork, the original project can take its own way. A fork would get an own name, own rules, own resource, would work to build own reputation, own community, etc. Nothing like this happened. Interesting to see, though, that if bad things happen silently, people get easily deceived since there's no word to compare with."}

Agree that if they're using the same/similar name, and if they're not actually adding any value then, well, they're making things worse. But again I'm not sure the example is a good one. Forking happens absolutely all the time in the open source software world. And there are similar challenges (and complaints and drama), I'm sure you can find better examples. But when I hear things like \"fake\" being thrown in those cases around it comes across as biased and unnecessary. Unless there's NAMING confusion - which is valid - neither the original or fork is less \"valid\", they stand on their own merits. If one is providing no value it usually will be eventually ignored.

Below is a step-by-step guide on how to add the specified entries: ### Step 1: Open Notepad as Administrator 1. **Press `Win + X`** to open the quick-access menu. 2. Select **Notepad (Admin)** from the list, or if you see \"Run as administrator\" next to Notepad in the context menu, select that. This step is crucial because modifying the hosts file requires administrative privileges. ### Step 2: Open the Hosts File 1. In the opened Notepad window, go to `File` > `Open`. 2. In the `File name:` box, type `%windir%\\System32\\drivers\\etc\\hosts`, then press `Enter`. This path points directly to the hosts file. - If you receive a warning about compatibility mode or file format, just click through the prompts by choosing `Yes` or selecting `Text Document (*.txt)` as the format. ### Step 3: Add Entries to Hosts File With the hosts file open in Notepad, scroll down to find an empty space and insert the lines: 193.218.118.42 libgen.is 193.218.118.42 libgen.rs 172.67.193.122 libgen.li ### Step 4: Save Changes 1. After adding the lines, go to `File` > `Save` or press `Ctrl + S`. Confirm any dialog prompts if they appear. ### Step 5: Flush DNS Cache (Optional but Recommended) To ensure your computer uses the new hosts file entries, it's good practice to flush the DNS cache: 1. Open Command Prompt as Administrator. 2. Type `ipconfig /flushdns` and press Enter. This command clears out any outdated or incorrect domain name information in memory. ### Step 6: Verify Changes - Try accessing `libgen.is`, `libgen.rs`, and `libgen.li`. You can use the `ping` command to check if the DNS resolution works correctly: ```shell ping libgen.is ``` This should show a response from the IP address you've added. ### Conclusion You have successfully updated your Windows hosts file with new entries directing specific domain names to their respective IP addresses. Always be cautious about what you add to this file, as incorrect entries can disrupt internet connectivity or cause security issues if used for malicious purposes."}

But as a PUBLISHED author, it galls me that >90% of the financial returns go to the publishers. As publication has become increasingly computerized, the powerful players in publishing hang on like grim death to their control of the process, even though they provide less and less in the way of vital contributions. We need to turn publishing into a domain where authors are charged realistic fees for **specific services rendered**, not where distribution of their work and most of the profits from it are controlled by greedy publishers. In the meantime, LibGen levels the playing field for people who cannot afford to pay for key books & articles for learning or research processes, and I am deeply thankful it exists. I hope that one day, it is no longer needed, and I hope that the owners / managers at Elsevier are first against the wall when the Revolution comes."}

We need capable people so we can keep going, why should someone pay to be able to help? It\u2019s mainly true with academic textbooks, like, you have to spend money to learn a craft to make money? That\u2019s fucking non-sense. I do recognize that there\u2019s work behind a book writing, but it\u2019s also widely known that the authors are the less profiting ones in this gig. My honest reason to upload stuff to libgen and similar platforms is that I can\u2019t stand and watch the Publisher\u2019s greed grow more and more. They started with DRM (you buy, but you can only have/use it where, when and while they allow). Not a long time ago some stopped selling books. You can\u2019t even have a physical copy anymore, only rent. Nowadays we have fuckers like vitalsource that will rent you a pdf that you can only read in their \u201csafe spot\u201d. Do you have a preferred annotation tool? Well, that\u2019s your problem, they make the rules. Profiting over knowledge is a growing disease and piracy seems to be the cure. Just venting, sorry."}

The publishers are profiting from both sides of the equation: The author and the reader. I dare to go further: Publishing is a line of business with virtually 0 risk.

The original intent has been lost. Publishing is not a line of business with 0 risk because no business comes with 0 risk. In your example of Nature, you mention that the author is charged a fee to publish. And yes, that's true because that fee covers peer review, editing (which EVERY written thing needs), and hosting. Websites with their own domain aren't free. I have to pay hosting for mine too. But the thing is that authors who write these articles aren't ONLY writing articles. They may be teaching at a university, speaking at conferences, or conducting research that's being funded by grants. They frequently collaborate with others on the articles. And Nature is open access, so the ONLY way they're making money to keep up with their expenses is by charging the author processing fee. On top of that, the authors retain the rights to their articles, so they can publish them elsewhere as well. There's no exclusively. Academic writing is a vastly different beast compared to non-academic and fiction writing, but they're being treated the SAME in LibGen. So unless every fiction book is purged from the database and every author is compensated, it's theft. Pure and simple."}

Now when I buy a book I'm forced to leave it on my device where it can be deleted by the seller every time that device goes online. If a publisher or Amazon came to my house and took away books from my shelves I'd be able to charge them with burglary and theft. Not so with ebooks. If I'm only allowed a *license* for a book I'd expect to get a significant discount on that purchase. But that's not what happens is it? At best I get a 15-20% discount over the hard copy price. Yeah I can wait until the book goes on sale but I have books sitting on my wish list that haven't gone on sale in 20 years. Often ebooks are riddled with errors upon release. If a hard copy book left the printers with the amount of errors allowed in ebooks the printer would likely find themselves sued. Ebooks often suffer deletion of photos, maps, tables and charts. All that B.S for such a measly discount. Ebooks are treated like bastard stepchildren by publishers. When publishers stop treating eBook customers like crap I'll consider not downloading their titles from free sources."}

So I searched for it again, chose an option further down and had luck with that. Feel free to shoot me a message if you want me to help you troubleshoot what's going on.

If you're rich and powerful you can do anything you want, and the laws don't apply to you, but at the same time the rich and powerful rely on those same laws as a weapon to secure their own power - after all, nine tenths of the law is property. most of these major companies intend to heavily profit off models that they will not make publicly available, or any of the analysis source code. I think OpenAI would legally destroy a researcher who leaked code or model weights to the public at large. In this case Meta has made their open source models Llama publicly available, so I think they're off the hook here, but for many companies, they are violating intellectual property law in order to make a profit, and they rely on the same intellectual property laws to sustain their profits."}

These good things you enjoy are the product of someone devoting their lives to it. Doctors go to med school for 12 years. Pipeline workers and infrastructure engineers work in terrible conditions for well over 40 hours. Professors get their PhDs, and write 1200+ page books. All these people expect to get paid a good amount as they worked their butts off to make these things available to you. They created a product/service, and are asking you to pay that much for their work. If an author decided to put their work out for free (Libretext, Openstax), good for them. Downloading a pdf of a book that costs money is stealing. It's no different than stealing books from a bookstore."}

I can only blame myself. We know [human beings don\u2019t make what we call moral judgments rationally.]( We come to these judgements intuitively, unreasoningly. \u201cMoral\u201d might not even be the best word. This is purely a descriptive statement, not a statement of what is good or bad. It\u2019s just what we do. These judgements are fundamentally different things from the morality discussed by ethicists and philosophers. Those are prescriptive ethics, what one should and ought to do. When I say slavery is repugnant, I am engaging in this kind of rational moral prescriptivism: it is a good and necessary function of human thought. However, in the world of human interaction, there is little evidence to suggest we are guided by such rational precepts of morality. Our morality is instead instilled in us by our surroundings: our parents, our social connections, our culture. What ethicists have to say on the matter only comes into it if we make a concerted effort to recruit it into our mental processes. Few people who are not professional ethicists or philosophers can. I am not attempting to endorse or vilify any position; I am not attempting to give cover to racists or slavers. I am trying to explain that morality is induced in most people through the social fabric of their lives, through which we perform a kind of motivated cognition to arrive at intuitive judgements, which are then, belatedly, rationally justified. I agree that we should listen to ethicists. But nothing in my research on this topic has suggested to me that we are capable of that. Of course, we imagine that we are. But in the crucible, we behave differently. We are not good predictors of our own behavior, moral or amoral. We are not as rational as we delude ourselves into believing. If you think someone needs a thesaurus to employ a rich vocabulary, I suggest you read more challenging material."}

I grew up in a garbage public school system, my father was an abuser physically and emotionally, and I was primed to be terrible. But when I matured and understood matters, I sought to break the cycle of abuse. And I have. I am a much better, more patient, and more selfless man now. Humans are far more rational than you give them credit for. Yes, for most people, the strongest influencer is the subconscious. But humans are able to modify that consciously. To my main point. Stealing PDF copies of an aurhor's book is bad. Morality is not relative, no matter how many influences say something is right, there are absolute moral truths.

Z-Lib has decided, looks like, that if they\\[re not going to be treated as a library doing a public service, then f' it, they'll aim for maximum profiteering from their collections.

It\u2019ll end up being like the piratebay\u2026 I dunno if you still go there or not, but there\u2019s like hundreds of proxies and mirrors. If any server provider tries to take it down, they\u2019ve got so many backups it\u2019s like whack a mole. Did you have any luck with www.libgen.li ? I tried there and it seems to be working ok\u2026 some of the d/l links go to alternate domains which are down, so it\u2019s not all perfect. One book I tried to find gave me a link to Anna\u2019s Archive\u2026 if you don\u2019t know about that database it could be a good stopgap for while we wait\u2026 take a look [here]( I didn\u2019t know about Anna\u2019s until now\u2026 in the main heading they say \u201cwe mirror Sci-Hub and Libgen\u201d. So I guess I\u2019ll go there for now. Im like 99% sure it\u2019ll be back though\u2026 I work in webdev, and have had to fix issues like this before. Not taking scheduled backups incase of server crash is like super bad noob practice, and sometimes DNS can just be a bitch\u2026 DNS routing is relatively easy 99.9% of the time, however sometimes it just refuses to propagate and you can\u2019t get your domain to point yo your server for whatever reason\u2026 Usually it takes like 30mins to fix a DNS issue, but if you run into an unexpected problem (which is what looks like the case here)\u2026 it can take longer than usual cos you have to do spend a heap of time trying to figure out the bug, then fix. If they\u2019ve lost their server for whatever reason and they need to restore from a backup (that could also be the problem)\u2026 bug fixing can take anywhere from an hour to a couple months. The main thing is, as long as there\u2019s a backup they\u2019re A ok, and I highly doubt they weren\u2019t taking backups. So don\u2019t worry too much :)"}

Changing those social relations does not happen on its own but through the people knowing about resources like it and confronting the contradiction that its illegality represents. To hide and obfuscate access to the resource would be to effectively do the work of the IP holders for them. They want things like this shut down because they're rent seeking parasites who want people to think the only way to get access to information is through paying them. Sometimes doing the right thing is risky."}

Also, stealing other's people hard work for free and calling it \"doing the right thing\" is pretty rich. We all use libgen, so I'm not going to moralize, but to actually have the gall to call it \"doing the right thing\" is beyond self-serving.

I think it's also funny you characterize creation of resources for people to access a massive repository of information as \"selfishness\", and you do so right after saying you don't want to moralize! Your position that it's not pragmatic to help people access LibGen is also just one that doesn't really make sense. Everyone knows about LibGen. There's no way that it could be \"hidden\". Do you really think that the governments trying to crack down on it would ever not be able to find something like this? LibGen has a Wikipedia page! The logical extreme of your \"practicality\" is just to shut down the sites for distributing the files entirely, giving access only to the miniscule group of people who are \\*legally entitled\\* to the files. But we do not create libraries and resources like LibGen for the inane purpose of having giant databases and maintaining the existence of those databases, because books and information are literally pointless without people interacting with them. This is going to be my last reply to you because frankly, I don't think this is going to go anywhere. I think you should allow yourself to interrogate the social relations that are involved in this discourse more, the way you talk about using LibGen and distributing digital files seems to point towards some kind of internal guilt about it all, that you think it's unethical and selfish. Because we both clearly have substantially differing positions on the social relations involved in what we're discussing and the ethics behind it, I don't think we'll ever really have a productive discourse on this topic. Regardless, assuming you're also a proletarian, I wish you the best."}

You do bring up some good points, like libgen having a wikipedia. I'm not sure when that page was created, but the more mainstream exposure the greater the likelihood that the powers that be will have incentive to shut it down. In other words, yes, it's a bit paradoxical: the more you spread the word about it, the more people actually have free resources, the greater the motivation from publishers and governments to shut it down. It's a simple scaling problem, that leads to a generic Prisoner'a dilemma: if everyone used libgen, the publishing industry would perish. Meaning, the system of incentives that generates academic and otherwise publications would collapse. My point is not that I'm against ordinary people having access to these resources. And I'm not on the side of predatory publishers that try to maximize profit or artificially create digital scarcity. To be frank, my impression is that the publishing industry in general struggles to stay alfloat. (There are far worse and more pernicious industries). But that the publishing industry exists in a wider ecosystem where academics, writers, creators have to also survive. Whether the relationship between authors and publishers, distributors, wholesalers etc is symbiotic is an open question; I'm sure the terms are not entirely fair. But the incentives for production of any kind would be severely undercut if there were no monetary incentive. In other words, there's an ecosystem of monetary compensation that keeps things in balance. Even in a communist system, you still have a system of value exchange. So something has to be given in exchange for the labour of the other that wrote, compiled and distributed the book. That's where the guilt comes in. When I download from libgen I'm free riding on a system where because most people pay, I benefit without giving anything back in return. My guilt is toward the people that wrote these books with the sweat of their brow. But maybe there's a better way of distributing monetary compensation than pursuing profits. Maybe, as far as academics are concerned, their salaries should suffice. Perhaps this last point is where we disagree? Anyway, thanks for engaging with me. I appreciate your thoughtful response and sincerity."}

Slow downloads are free of charge, but are ... well, slower. The download itself is unaffected but the speed varies. For larger files, I find the slow download makes it impossible. My downloads pause or fail at various points as it is, so it can be quite infuriating to have a book Libgen runs through in 20 seconds take 30 minutes (again and again and again, because it interrupts). Still, Anna's Archive is doing real work by trying to preserve all the remaining, scattered shadow libraries out there, and I know professionals in academia who proudly pay them for that. As for your second question, there will be a download link when you click one of the \"Slow Download\" links. Usually the first two Slow Download links will have a waitlist. You can download your file when the waitlist reaches you, or you can use the metered out download link, usually the third? (but your download will be *much* slower then). In any case, a link will appear and you'll click it, the same as Libgen."}

Quite often this is due to a complete monopoly on the market for higher education texts (other factors can be argued, like the costs of limited runs vs larger scale nonfiction for public consumption, but this is by far the largest). And that cost is only going up, with the cost rising 4% a year on average since the start of the millennium. This year it's gone up by 7.4% on last year, according to the CPI The affordability has become one of the low-key social justice issues of the last few years. Resources like libgen genuinely bring some equity to the situation. Yes, there is some other piracy happening too. But there is good being done.

Being nuke-resistant really wasn't a main goal at that point. The internet as we know it grew from there. No longer servers in universities and military bunkers, but purpose-built warehouses and data centers.

The development of intangible assets profoundly redefines the concept of property and the functioning of capitalism. Since intangible assets, such as information, software and knowledge, can be reproduced infinitely without additional costs, the principle of traditional private property, based on scarcity and exclusivity of use, becomes problematic. The value of these assets increases the more they are shared, in contrast with the logic of industrial capitalism which is based on the accumulation and exclusive control of resources. Capital reacts to this contradiction by imposing regimes of forced privatization of knowledge through patents, copyrights and monopolies on digital infrastructures, transforming knowledge into a commodity and limiting its diffusion. This strategy clashes with the natural tendency of cognitive work to generate collective innovation, fueled by sharing and cooperation. The result is a tension between the logic of the market and the social nature of intangible production that makes the current economic and political system unstable. That\u2019s all."}

To this we must add that capital is increasingly becoming an income that is not concerned with setting the production process in motion as in the Fordist factory because the cognitive worker possesses both executive and intellectual skills at the same time, which were separate in the Taylorist-Fordist factory."}

I would answer that it is true, school, the extraordinary European public health system or the welfare state in general are not free. It may be free for the user but not for those who have to pay for its maintenance. Precisely for this reason there are taxes that must be paid progressively by making those who have more contribute to a greater extent. As for the cultural heritage of humanity, it is reduced to a commodity by capitalism thanks to the process of commodification. This is the way in which elements previously not considered exchange goods are transformed into goods with economic value. In the case of world heritage, this phenomenon manifests itself through tourism, branding and commercialization of cultural and historical identity. Let's think about the tourist market, in which world heritage sites become attractions marketed to generate profits. As regards the relationship between science and capitalism, science cannot be considered a neutral activity independent of social relations because it is shaped by the logic of the market, the division of labor and the interests of capital. The transition from industrial to monopolistic-technological capitalism has transformed science into an immediate productive force, which implies its increasing subordination to the needs of capitalist accumulation. This leads to a qualitative change in the way knowledge is produced because research is no longer guided by an autonomous logic of cognitive progress but by needs imposed by the economic and military apparatus. The financing of scientific research by private companies and the State is not aimed at a neutral accumulation of knowledge but at the creation of new goods, new technologies and new control mechanisms. Even the selection of research problems, the allocation of resources and the direction of technological development are all determined by social and economic structures. In advanced capitalism this translates into a priority assigned to the most profitable areas, often to the detriment of research sectors that would have a more significant social impact but fewer possibilities for economic valorization. Science is a social product and as such is subject to power dynamics. It is not neutral. The capitalist use of science is not limited to the production of goods because it also affects the ideological sphere, justifying development models based on unlimited growth and the commodification of every aspect of knowledge."}

But it's a tiny hurdle, really. There is no coding involved though, and no need to understand code. I'll explain everything above, so you'll see how simple this can be: # 0: check out the site for the script > [ The github link points to where the script resides. If you find a web service or app that downloads for you, chances are that its just built around this script. If something is changed on the [Archive.org]( end, chances are the script will break. And so will web services and apps. If the script is then updated, it's not certain that the app or the web service will be. So these github things are way more reliable. And, as I've said, they're not hard to understand, you just need to try the thing out, stub your toe a couple of times, ask for help, and all of a sudden it's something you understand. Importantly: Usually the instructions on github pages are better than something that a user on reddit types in quickly. And you can get chatgpt or a nerd friend to guide you through this. Here are the rest of the steps: # 1: install python This install is like any app install. So you can do it by downloading an installer, clicking the icon in the downloads folder, press ok a bunch of times, etc. Or you can decide to learn a bit and do it from the terminal, which is super simple and well documented. # 2: enter the folder You put the script in the same folder the downloads go to. It's just less mess that way. First you create the folder, then you navigate to it. You do it via terminal, you navigate by typing in **cd ..** to go backwards (towards the hard drive) or typing **CD \\[name of your folder\\]** to go forwards, towards a folder. You can create the folder in the terminal, or just in macos/windows/whatever else. This is super easy but if something doesn't make sense, ask someone. You can even just ask chatgpt, it's usually very clear. Example: **On MacOS**, **I have a folder** that is in my user folder, **called 'boop'**. Thats where I put stuff like this. **I created a subfolder** in there using finder **called archive-dl**. I just **navigated to 'boop' in finder**, pressed cmd-shift-n to create a new folder and called it archive-dl. **In terminal**, all all I need to do is **open a new window, type 'cd'** and space and drag the folder over the terminal window. now the window says 'cd /Users/my-user-name/boop/archive-dl'. I press enter and we are done. Takes 30 seconds. # 3: install the script >open a terminal run pip install -r requirements.txt, **'pip'** is a bit like an app store. It's connected to Python, the coding language, and serves up python stuff. You type 'pip' to run it. **'install'** tells it to install something. **'-r'** tells pip there's a requirements file. It's like a shoping list. What you are fetching is a bunch of little tools that work together. The requirements file gets all the stuff you need, you don't need to worry about it. 'requirements.txt' is that shopping list. # 4: use the script. >and then for basic usage: python3 archive-org-downloader.py -e [YOUR@EMAIL.COM](mailto:YOUR@EMAIL.COM) \\-p YOURPASSWORD -r 0 -u [ 'python3' starts python. '[archive-org-downloader.py]( starts the script in python. \"-e\" means email, in this context. The next thing is your email. '-p' is probably to tell the script that the next text object is the password it needs to download. I don't know what -r or 0 mean here and I don't care. '-u' means that the following text object is an url. **YOU DO NOT NEED TO UNDERSTAND ANYTHING ABOVE. But I explained it anyway, so you can have a sense of what you're doing. You just need to understand this one thing:** To use the script, you get the \"bookurl\". Its in the url, in the browser window. it resides after .../details/ and before the next /. So if you are looking at a book, the URL will also include stuff like the page, and so on. You delete all that. Example: [ get the text in bold-italic, skip the rest. And you replace BOOKURL with that. so: python3 archive-org-downloader.py -e [YOUR@EMAIL.COM](mailto:YOUR@EMAIL.COM) \\-p YOURPASSWORD -r 0 -u [ becomes python3 archive-org-downloader.py -e [YOUR@EMAIL.COM](mailto:YOUR@EMAIL.COM) \\-p YOURPASSWORD -r 0 -u [ # 5: Profit! Actually no. But you can have steady access to a book that probably doesn't exist as a for-sale ebook."}

I just tried it & it's marked as SEIZED. Hard to believe the publishers put so much money and effort into this seek & destroy event, considering all these books are already available at most libraries for free. Oh well, that's their own wasting of money hoping their shareholders will boost activity, for that quarterly multi-million dollar profiting blip. They've got their owners fooled so far that they are actually retaining more money in revenue (absolute poppycock, of course!); I read 200-500 books a year & pay for about 1 book(if under $15CAD) per decade. None of the books I download is a loss of money to the publisher or author, not one! Stupid futhermuckers attacking the honest seeking of knowledge! It's the modern version of Fahrenheit 451! How many millions of books have been \"burned\" in these seizures of Z-Lib, Libgen, & Anna's? It's Alexandria all over again! By the same people seeking to limit the public's ability to learn, think, & eventually realize we're being taken for a very expensive and self-harming ride by our so-called *leaders*. Someone, with a LOT more programming knowledge than I, needs to create a free ebooks site that operates much like [thepiratebay.info]( does -- rotate through various domains including some that are blocked with VPN to all but the random switching pattern's source. Allow these other sites to provide links to their own mirrors & sites, with a credit tag on each filename."}

Ask Google to take their site down. 6. Pay a specific company the author is hawking to do this for you again and again forever (the author constantly hypes this company and has links in the book to it all over the place; it's basically a big ad for them.)

There are no official options to support libgen by financial means or otherwise, for what I\u2019m aware of. Likewise, the actual causes for libgen blackouts remain unverified, the libgen team does not make any official annoncements, which would be the most credible source to get the information from. Several explanations of the blackout persist among the subreddits/etc: 1) copyright lawsuits by Elsevier and Springer Nature and so on that target the shadow libraries such as libgen, Anna\u2019s Archive, z-library (e.g. 2) Meta corporation scraping LibGen to use as training data for AI models; 3) the main service provider for the original libgen (not LG+) is based on the Ukranian Data Network ( its servers have been either temporarily or permanently shut down due to the war conditions (there have been comments on previous threads suggesting that the cause is not the war attacks on infrastructure but \u201cequiment seized by the Ukrainian police\u201d; Knowing these three potential explanations the 2nd one about AI-data scraping, often repeated on this subreddit, remains less likely than it might seem, imo. When it comes to the blackouts of libgen -- perhaps anti-piracy legal action may be a factor, though one always has to bear in mind that the shadow libraries are maintained volutarily and non-commercially, that they continue to garner large amounts of daily traffic that put a large strain on the servers and because of that are in principle less stable archival infrastructures. In case of blackout, remember to check out open-slum.org and if not libgen or LG+, there is Anna\u2019s Archive, z-library (and WeLib -- although cannot verify if it is safe; see announcement \u201cNew blog post: An update from the team\u201d on Anna\u2019s Archive)."}

I will find better ways of operating though and I think if libgen doesn't come back i \\*may\\* be able to improvise and once it's good I'll be sure to spread around."}

Connect to a server outside your home country (especially if access to LibGen is blocked). Recommended: Choose a server in a privacy-friendly country like Switzerland or the Netherlands. Step 2: Go to a LibGen Mirror There are several LibGen mirrors. Popular working ones include: \u26a0\ufe0f If one mirror is down or blocked, try another. Step 3: Search for the Book or Article Use the search bar at the top. You can search by: Title Author ISBN Publisher Year Example: Searching for \u201cIntroduction to Algorithms\u201d Step 4: Choose the Correct Entry You'll see a list of matching books/articles. Look for the edition/year/format you want (e.g., PDF, EPUB). Check the file size and publisher to confirm it\u2019s what you\u2019re looking for. Step 5: Turn off VPN and Click the Download Link Click on the [LibGen] or [GET] link in the right column. You\u2019ll be redirected to a download page. Step 6: Download the File On the redirect/download page, click the final \u201cDownload\u201d or \u201cGet\u201d button. Your file (usually PDF or EPUB) should start downloading immediately. Do NOT click on ads, pop-ups, or fake download buttons. Stick to the main links. \u2705 Tips for Safe Downloading Use an ad blocker (like uBlock Origin). Avoid clicking on anything outside the main LibGen interface. Scan files with antivirus software if you're unsure. For very large files (e.g. textbooks), make sure you have enough space and a strong internet connection."}

They are really cheap nowadays - for instance all 700 books I have collected for later reading, clock in at about 24GB, so if you buy a cheap device storing 1TB, you really should be fine for many years to come. But have a backup ready too; I have had a few of those devices be damaged, so backup was always important. One TB external USB device costs about 50 Euros or so; you can probably find even cheaper ones. Movies take up more space, but after I collected about 240 movies so far, I realised that many movies are bad, so I only store good movies that I may want to rewatch myself or with others; and once you become more critical, you automatically collect fewer movies, because keeping crap movies doesn't make a whole lot of sense. But \"books\" are much easier to store, either in .pdf or .epub variant."}

Sure, we have mirrors of libgen but the infrastructure is certainly being weakened. I think there are ways to reorient the infrastructure to make it more resilient to legal attacks and preserve unrestricted access to information. ***P2P networks*** Having a centralized server in one location creates a single point of failure. The entire libgen library needs to be backed up to P2P networks. I know much of this data exists on IPFS and torrents but there also needs to be a way to organize metadata and search through everything. It would be cool to have a \"master\" torrent for the entire library and individual torrents for each file so that people can only seed subsets of the library. Additionally, we can enforce a layer on top of torrents or IPFS where you have to seed what you download to others in order to continue participating in the network. This makes sure the material you download is available to others, you also make the network stronger by downloading your own library and sharing it. ***Cryptography*** Using public key cryptography for identity and encryption in an effective way could make the network more resilient. Personally, I understand there could be legal and ethical concerns about piracy. Ultimately though, unrestricted access to information is so important... Particularly for people who don't have access to resources otherwise. I feel like improvements in these two technical areas could make for a shadow library that can survive legal attacks more easily because it would be a distributed network which wouldn't be able to be taken down by any one court or country. I want libgen to come back stronger, I really hope it does. In the meantime, I'm also considering volunteering for Anna's Archive. These tools are worth having access to despite any legal concerns imo and maybe we need to contribute somehow to make sure access stays available."}

It is clear that there is someone behind the strategic disruption against libgen. It reminds me of the older fight against piratebay. We need something that can not be disrupted. Perhaps a new variant of the world wide web. Decentralized everything. A web that guarantees that e. g. DoS attacks can never work to begin with. I don't know how this would all look like, but we definitely need something new and more secure. > despite any legal concerns imo I have no \"legal concern\". Basically the modern day law is slavery. I am not at all against authors getting a fair share of their work compensated of course, mind you, but how does this apply to books where the original authors are long dead already? I fail to see that in any way so I could not care any less for laws that enact slavery. The People have not authorized such laws, lobbyists and corporate gangsters have. They don't represent me nor most other people."}

I am absolutely furious for the artists and the creators that Ai sloppers are going to ruin this for us but I realised, reading an article about Aaron Swartz (Reddit's - not evil - creator) - how important the public's access to knowledge is in the day and age of AI. Would you rather your kid read actual writer or a copy of the writer you love? Be it books or research articles - if you were to DM the writer, most of them are too happy to pass you the real thing for no charges. May be we can name it - Guerilla Open Access or Goagen (pronounced Go-Gen) for Aaron who fought so hard for the access of information for all. As someone who has benefited from free access of the knowledge to things i could not have had access to living in third world, where most of the stuff was either banned or not published or delivered to or just wasn't affordable - I want the next generation to have same access. It has not deminished the size of bookshelves in my house nor my love for the crreations of so many talented people - I still support those artists (I am an artist - most likely, my writings, movies and videos were already fed to the Ai dummies). Hell my recordings were used for major sports event and I was never paid for them despite it being a human led production. Let's not let the desire for capital gains be the reason we shut information behind pay walls for all. P.s Apologies for any typos or errors."}

Effort should be rewarded financially too, but not greed in regards to old books.) This is also why I think it should not be just Libgen or Anna's Archive or Piratebay. We really need something much more fundamental and integrated. Something that no longer can be taken down by public cops acting as corporate watchdogs raiding places. You can probably make a donation if you want to; Anna's Archive encourages this. I am not sure what is going on with libgen. They seem to struggle a LOT since some months.

The private datasets mentioned in this paper can be obtained by contacting the author * Introduction Due to my significant need for the Anna Archive, this site has excellent availability (ignoring copyright issues, it won't be shut down by the FBI (zlib), and its mirrors and official site (libgen) rarely go down), and its book metadata is very comprehensive with abundant page information. However, its download speed is too slow, and the next book takes at least one minute to load after watching an ad, while its membership fees are relatively high. However, it features a very user-friendly external download link section listing up to ten external download methods. Although I carefully researched various methods, only libgen and magnet links are relatively stable download methods. IPFS and STC are completely unusable for downloads, and since magnet links have a high barrier to entry for beginners like me (each book requires writing a script to download via magnet links\u2014the specific reasons can be researched on your own), libgen's high-speed download method, which allows direct downloads with a single click, has become the optimal download method for Anna Library. However, as mentioned earlier, the availability of the libgen site is constantly changing, and the official libgen site is relatively safer than third-party mirrors. Therefore, secondary checks on mirror availability and security are crucial. However, while there are indeed excellent shadow library uptime monitoring sites available, such as \\[SLUM: The Shadow Library Uptime Monitor\\]( they can only be used for intuitive understanding and cannot be integrated into automated tools. Additionally, the external download fold list in the Anna Archive, which has been relegated to the background, requires multiple steps to access. Therefore, this paper proposes a speed-testing frontend server that supports API calls and a Tampermonkey script that calls this server, enabling us to conveniently jump to Libgen for downloads in two steps during book downloads and obtain Libgen's website availability on any browser page. * Method Since GPT is becoming increasingly unreliable, the entire project was built using the excellent Claude AI. * Results Omitted * Discussion Although this paper has indeed made significant contributions to the open-source community, due to unknown bugs, the floating menu still has some issues: 1. It cannot be dragged to move horizontally or vertically; it can only switch between the left and right sidebar positions. 2.

When they stop trying to screw you over for 10s of 1000s of dollars, you can start caring about stealing .5k from them. For comparison, Post grad uni in Chiba Japan costs less that 7 thousand a year for me as a foreigner, where UNT cost 14 thousand for out of state domestic students. For one semester. Average cost is around 40k for a year after fees and suches. The textbooks you get in Japan are often so cheap you can find them in their version of the dollar store. The text books in America are so expensive people take out separate loans just for books."}

Who decided it is ethical to charge ABSURD amounts of money for textbooks (most of which goes to the publisher, the authors usually get a pittance) but it's unethical to download the textbook for free because you literally need it to pass the class, or because you want to learn but can't afford a textbook? Why should you only be allowed to participate in your courses, only be allowed access to this knowledge, if you're able to spend hundreds of dollars? It's important to ask who these \"ethics\" really benefit. Is it more beneficial to have a widely educated population, or richer publication CEOs? Is it more important that the publishers get to profit off of broke students, or that students get access to the information they need to learn? The guilt you're feeling is the result of a system that values profit over anything else, not some universal ethical code of what is \"good\" and what is \"bad\". Download the textbooks and put that $500 in your savings homie."}

I don't know how they divvy it up, and that's not my concern; I just know \"I've paid copyright\" so I have a right to COPY. Not to SHARE or broadcast, as those are separate IP rights. Before this new copyright act was put in place, my reasoning, in helping myself readily to movies, tv, books, & music for free was that I'm not stealing if my actions do not cause the owners(not the creators) to lose money. Look on YouTube for a cute animation called \"Copying Is Not Theft\"; the right one has a cartoon bunny riding a bicycle. It makes good points. If I steal your bicycle, you have to walk to work But if I just COPY it, we both can ride--that's what copying is for! Theft involves me taking away your legal possession of a thing, so you no longer have it, and having it myself, in the end. Internet Piracy is a made up crime the big industries use to control people & governments, while making extra billions. It could be argued, I'm sure, that if you have the means to buy the books in question,, but you copy instead, then you've stolen the costs from the owners, but if you were unable to afford the books and just want to access the contents/information, you have not caused any loss; only a gain. Some philosophize that all information belongs to everyone. If it were me, I'd use my bursaries to purchase books as able, but I'd still grab the ePubs as I find it easier to read on a device, with content magnified for my aging eyes. These are my own thoughts that guide my own actions. It's up to you to determine your own philosophy on the issue. It does, technically, involve civil disobedience, so under those principles, expect to have to pay the civil penalties, rightly enacted or wrongly. Me, I'll be happy to stand up in court & ruin these larcenous corporations' cash grabs for years to come, in open court, with reporters taking notes to publish; I'll have pre-instructed them top publish live on their sites, as the judge may have been bribed or otherwise convinced to invoke a No Publish order on my testimony. Oh well, people will ask me what happened in court, & I never lie, so the word will get out as word of mouth no matter what! If they're smart, tyhey won't mess with the Cyberpope (me); I fight back. . to win."}

{"id": "1n4vjud", "type": "submission", "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/libgen/comments/1n4vjud/megathread_status_of_libgen/", "author": "shrine", "created_utc": 1756649048, "score": 336, "title": "MEGATHREAD | Status of LibGen", "content": "# LibGen Mirrors: How do I access Library Genesis? There are several different mirrors of the LibGen collections, each maintained by independent project teams. Our subreddit is not affiliated with any domain; we just guide you on how to access them safely based on knowledge shared by our community. While the main original mirror (ad-free and non-profit) is currently down, the collection remains accessible and the mission stays strong. Read below for details on how to access the mirrors. ## ONE: You never need to install extra software to access LibGen. Never run an `exe` and never download a proclaimed \"LibGen app\" from the Google Play store or iOS App Store. There are no legitimate or trusted mobile apps for LibGen: primary access is via your web browser. ## TWO: Donate only through trusted domains. Use only the trusted domains listed here and review their specific donate-to-download policies. Be cautious: search engines may lead you to fraudulent domains that will steal your donation. 1. **Anna's Archive:** Non-profit. No account required. Non-profit mirror with both free (slow, wailist) and paid (fast, no waitlist) access. *\"The largest truly open library in human history. \u2b50\ufe0f We mirror Sci-Hub and LibGen. We scrape and open-source Z-Lib, DuXiu, and more. 44,152,017 books, 12,780,020 papers \u2014 preserved forever. All our code and data are completely open source.*\" [ 2. **Z-Library:** For-Profit. Account Required. Limits downloads to 10 books per day. Donate or use their Telegram bot to download more books once you reach your limit. For-profit mirror with paid access. \"*Your gateway to knowledge and culture*.\" [ 3. **Open-Slum status index:** Safe, free website for reviewing the uptime of all of the mirrors. Maintained by a known contributor. [ 4. **LG+:** Non-profit. No account required. The ad-free .BZ domain is currently down. The ,LI, .GS, .LA, and .GL domains are up, but serve ads. We cannot link to these domains from here because the ad networks that LG+ is forced to use can sometimes serve malicious ads. The project itself is trustworthy, but the ad networks are not. **Required**: Install [uBlock Origin]( or [AdGuard]( in order to protect your browser and device from potential malware when using these mirrors. You never need to install any software to access LibGen. 5. **LG:** Non-profit. All domains are down or seized. This thread serves as the megathread for all questions about the status and safety of specific sites, and alternative access options. New \"is it up?\" posts will be deleted, all updates and questions should go here."}

We recommend not using them.\u201d AA team is saying that WeLib is not collaborating, they are free riding \u2014 forking the entire collection and website code without giving back.

On the other hand, making a necessary copy in the process of engaging in a protected fair use does not infringe. In each of these, the courts held that intermediate or incidental copying that is \"necessary\" to enable fair use is itself sheltered by the doctrine. (List from GPT 5) * **Sega Enterprises Ltd. v. Accolade, Inc., 977 F.2d 1510 (9th Cir. 1992)** The court held that intermediate copying of Sega\u2019s video game code, made as part of reverse engineering, was fair use because it was necessary to access unprotected functional elements. * **Sony Computer Entertainment, Inc. v. Connectix Corp., 203 F.3d 596 (9th Cir. 2000)** Similar to *Sega*, the court ruled that making temporary copies of Sony\u2019s PlayStation BIOS during reverse engineering was fair use, since it enabled the creation of a new, non-infringing product (an emulator). * **Kelly v. Arriba Soft Corp., 336 F.3d 811 (9th Cir. 2003)** A search engine\u2019s copying of photographs to create thumbnails was held transformative and fair use, even though entire images were duplicated in the process. * **Perfect 10, Inc. v.** [**Amazon.com**]( Inc., 508 F.3d 1146 (9th Cir. 2007)** Google\u2019s reproduction of entire images for use in its image search engine was held to be fair use, since the purpose was transformative. * **Authors Guild v. Google, Inc., 804 F.3d 202 (2d Cir. 2015)** Google\u2019s scanning of entire books for its digital search index was fair use; the court emphasized that although complete copies were made, they were necessary to achieve the transformative purpose."}

Let me try to explain in simple terms what Anna's archive is: Anna's archive is basically a search engine that crawls/aggregates \u201cshadow libraries\u201d (LibGen, Sci-Hub, Z-Library, etc.) so you can look up book/article records in one place. It\u2019s open-source, was spun up after the Z-Library crackdown, and it links out to mirrors rather than being just a single host. In order to make this motley collection of documents and data searchable, Anna's archive scrapes and unifies metadata from multiple collections into one big index. When you search for a file, you\u2019re seeing records pointing to places where files are mirrored/hosted, often via file mirrors or peer-to-peer (torrent) ecosystems. Because what Anna's archive indexes is generally copyrighted material, the project frequently ends up in legal crosshairs (scraping disputes, blocking orders, domain shuffles). That being said - if you want to seed anna's archive, you will find the list of Torrents on the below link along with instruction on how to seed. [ You can select datasets based on your available hard drive space and prioritize datasets based on your interest or datasets that are in high demand. The entire archive is 1.1 Petabytes (1 million gigabytes), but I can see torrents that are less than 50 GB on the site which is small enough for almost all modern laptops."}

Yes. They're all going to have most of the same books in general because many of the same old sources/archives/etc. Same or similar foundations on massive collections, in other words. But each may have other smaller sources or contributing members or stuff that was obtained after the basic databases were built. EG I'm posting on here, but I don't post on Twitter. Doesn't really matter, a search takes only a few seconds and all the files are generally small(with the exceptions of textbooks maybe?)."}
