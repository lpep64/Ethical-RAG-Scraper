We are aiming to support a ton of iOS devices, and in doing so, we obviously don’t want to fudge it up lol. Also, we wanted to honor the amazing reception that the community showed towards our announcement by adding a lot of requested refinements and features that wouldn’t disrupt the roadmap too much, as we knew users would appreciate us listening to the community. We understand people are excited for Triton, and we are trying our best to bring it out to the public as quickly as we can. We will announce any news as it unfolds as new posts in the subreddit to ensure visibility to everyone. I really can’t stress how important it is to me personally that we don’t flop this tweak — it’s my first tweak project ever, and I only started teaching myself SwiftUI this past March. It’s been a hell of a ride these past months perfecting the UI. I truly hope it lives up to what you are looking for! Thank you for your continued support."}

Newer Linux and Android versions are more likely to work. I used a Sony Xperia XZ1 Compact on Android 10 with kernel 4.14, rooted with Magisk 20.3. * A terminal app on your Android device, for instance Termux. * A way to connect your two devices. In particular some of the Apple USB-C to Lightning cables _cannot_ be used to put iDevices in DFU mode due to missing pins. I used the Exsys EX-47990 USB-C to USB-A adapter and the Apple USB-A to Lightning cable. **Tutorial** 1. Download the checkra1n binary for Linux and the correct µarch of your Android device. 2. Put it in a directory where execution is allowed, I used `/data` but the Termux virtual storage may be a cleaner solution. 3. Connect your iDevice to it. 4. Open the terminal app and gain root access. `su` 5. Check that your iDevice is recognized. `lsusb` The USB ID should be `05ac:12a8`. 6. Put your iDevice in DFU mode, see for instructions. 7. Check that your iDevice is still recognized. `lsusb` Now the USB ID should be `05ac:1227`. If it's no longer listed try to unplug the USB-C cable from the Android device and plug it again. 8.

For what it's worth it's just me building Apollo, a team sounds nice though. :P The jailbreaking community has always been super awesome to Apollo, but I got a lot of emails (hundreds) from users who the iTunes daemon or something related broke and was causing the in-app purchase to spin indefinitely. iTunes wasn't even sending a message back to the Apollo process that an error occurred, it's like the connection was just severed. To this day I'm not sure why that happens for some jailbroken devices or what tweaks cause it, but many users have reported luck fixing it with the terminal command `launchctl reboot userspace` (and this alert will mention that command in the next update actually). A few people have mentioned, \"Yeah but Apollo has Fort Knox class DRM to oppress jailbreakers!\" so I wanted to address that, so I'll copy-paste what I responded to another comment with: The \"aggressive DRM\" you outlined was literally an if statement that checked if you have LocalIAPStore or related apps installed. 99% of jailbroken devices per my server stats never received that notification. And of those notifications 99% were for LocalIAPStore and for people pirating apps. A few users mentioned that \"DLG\" was incorrectly flagged, and [well see if you can guess why I made that mistake]( Seeing that it had legitimate uses, I removed it. Honestly this gets very annoying. The jailbreaking community is honestly great, and loves to talk about how \"it's not about pirating!\" when everyone accuses them of that. But a very small subset of jailbroken Apollo users are pirating it and it's a pain in the ass so I added some very light checks that say \"When you're activating Apollo's in-app purchases, if you have piracy tools installed, please remove them or at the very least disable them for Apollo with something like Choicy\". This isn't DRM, this is asking the jailbreaking community to walk the walk when they say they're not about pirating, and just disable a damn pirating tweak when they're activating Apollo. In the most recent update I updated Apollo to even spell out the piracy tweak and the directory it's installed in, and it'll even check if it's a running process rather than simply installed so if you disable it via Choicy it won't flag it. Again, I love the jailbreaking community, please don't raise up pirates. This is exactly the shit that leads to developers just being like \"Fuck it, the jailbreaking community is toxic and I'm just going to disable the app for jailbroken users\". It's incredibly frustrating to support you guys and ensure that Apollo has literally no limitations if you're jailbroken, but then see comments like this upvoted by you guys when I'm literally just like \"Hey, you have pirating software installed while trying to unlock Apollo Pro, can you not?\" To answer a few other questions: **Is it even helping?** Yeah it is, I've received a lot of emails, PMs and posts in the Apollo subreddit [like this one]( **Show us the code** Okay. Here's the check: `if library.lowercased().contains(\"localiapstore\") || library.lowercased().contains(\"iapfree\") || library.lowercased().contains(\"iapcrazy\") || library.lowercased().contains(\"iap cracker\") {` shouldn't take a Computer Science degree to see that that's some pretty straightforward code that says \"is one of the injected libraries in Apollo literally a piracy tweak\". This is ran when you \"purchase\" the app to see if the purchase can be trusted."}

I can show proof of funds. We can also use escrow like [Coinsavr]( Many people thought that 48 hours was a terrible amount of time when I created a similar thread a few months ago. While I agree, the time frame was for those developers who were interested in releasing a jailbreak free of charge. It was to motivate them. It was to make sure that those amazing developers knew that their time and effort is well appreciated. There have been many jailbreaks in the past that were released for free, without any compensation. If you require more than 48 hours, please let me know, and I'll gladly extend this time frame to better suit your needs. Anyhow, I am willing to compensate for your time and effort by personally sending you $20,000 CAD in BTC if you release an iOS 12.1.2 jailbreak that works on iPhone X and XS Max. Cydia must be available and jailbreak must be open source. If someone is successful with the jailbreak, you can PM me or post here and I will send you BTC to your desired Thank you! ---- #Final update Due to the toxicity of so many people, I am no longer interested in continuing this fundraiser for the SickKids Foundation. Google SickKids Foundation so you can 10000% be certain that it's a \"legit\" site you're donating to. The messages some people have left over my fundraiser's page is ridiculous. I can't understand how some people can be so immature. People always said that r/jailbreak is toxic, and I never really agreed with that because I was never really that involved with the drama. But now I realize what it means. Some people hate on you for trying to do something good and help the community. Thank you to those who donated to the fundraiser or the bitcoin address. I will honour the original bounty I posted because I am not going to let a few people's toxicities ruin it for all of you. I am not a \"middleman\" nor am I receiving any % of your donations. For transparency, [here is this thread before I edited it.]( I hope you all have an amazing day and hope all of you caught the gold train!

I personally am fine with the decreased security, but my bank is not. They detect if their banking app is running on a jailbroken device, and if so they disallow the app from running. I know that tweaks exist to try to prevent this, but my bank is very on top of things and breaks such bypasses with frequency. As such, I don't jailbreak my phone, just my iPad. This could be quite annoying for someone. They see this infographic, and they say \"oh, there are no downsides!\". Then they spend time jailbreaking, only to find out that they can't use their banking app or other apps which do the same thing, so they are forced to restore. Much time wasted. Even if the Jailbreak is fast, resyncing music or apps after a restore is a hassle if you have a large collection. EDIT: for anyone wondering, I bank with Barclays, and they prevent run on jailbreak devices on all their apps."}

As the jailbroken device could have anything on the device modified, all of which might be outside of the scope of control of the (sandboxed) banking app, it isn't possible for it to try to narrow its check to \"is something related to my banking function compromised\". The goal of this check is not that the jailbroken device is inherently \"less secure\": the device that was able to be jailbroken is also \"less secure\". The notion of security comes from what is possible, not what has happened. Instead, by checking if the device is jailbroken, the app hopes to determine if an attacker has already compromised the device, and \"is it jailbroken\" is the only reasonable check they can do. (Of course, it is also kind of a pointless check, as if someone was actually trying to attack the banking application they would modify the banking app to remove this check. The hope that these companies have is that they obfuscate their checks sufficiently and move them around in their code enough with new app updates that the attacker doesn't really have the time to correctly and persistently destroy the check.)"}

Once I got to WindowServer, I began exploring ways to provide Metal acceleration. I wasted a week trying to make M1 driver working, but it ended up only panicking my phone a lot… Luckily, I found out iOS simulator provides an interestingly convenient way to do so: streaming Metal via XPC. It only took me 2 days to get it working. Eventually, I managed to boot somewhat macOS 13.4 natively on my iPhone XS Max on iOS 16.5; keyboard&mouse input is currently done via VNC. After some manual patching, many apps and daemons running (WindowServer, ControlCenter, Dock, and even Xcode 15b8). This shows how much potential jailbreak can do other than just customizations. If this ends up being a one-click project, it would benefit iPad users a lot. Unfortunately, there are some graphical glitches and simulator’s Metal limitations when doing this way, so it would only work best on M iPads having native GPU drivers. I have a WIP repository containing patches: (for very technical people only for now)"}

I worked 7 and a half years in Apple Retail, 5 of which in the role of Genius. Let’s clear the air on the myth that Apple *makes* you update your phone prior to a hardware repair. Apple's *external* documentation on jailbreaking can be found [here]( While last updated in September of 2016, a lot of the verbiage dates back to the days of the 3GS when one could actually brick a device or lose radio/GPS functionality by flashing the wrong baseband with limera1n exploit. The document hasn’t meaningfully changed in years (cross reference [this]( archive of the same document from 2014); I remember seeing a very similar warning in print at the Genius Bar circa 2010. So, in theory, Apple can completely *deny service*, but they **cannot force you to update**. Now, theory and the everyday practice diverge greatly. At my store, most of us were ambivalent toward jailbreaking as long as the reported issue was demonstrably hardware-related or widespread. Several of us on the Genius team carried jailbroken devices. Management was aware and took a don’t-ask-don’t-tell approach. I have only once had to deny service for a 3G that failed to activate after the guy tampered with the baseband. Even then, I told him where to find information on how to resolve the issue but advised him he was on his own. These are simply not risks we face with modern jailbreaks. I once checked in a 5s that was failing battery diagnostics but was jailbroken on 10.2. My coworker on repair at the time decided to raise a stink. I took it to management and made the case that I can reproduce the issue with our own diagnostics and the issue persists when not running with root privileges, and that he actually had a reason why jailbreaking improved his experience with iPhone (he used BioProtect daily as he used his phone in his business). Management took my side and we proceeded with the repair. So how do you proceed? Reboot your device into a non-jailbroken state and make a backup. (The backup is extremely important because if the battery adhesive tabs break, Apple will *not* pry at a battery to remove it. They will simply close the device and replace the unit at the battery price.) Most employees won’t notice Cydia on your device if you tuck it away. Some won’t know what Cydia is. If they cause any friction, politely make a coherent case about If you have a reasonable need like testing an app you use for work that requires a lower iOS version, etc, state it concisely. If the employee pushes back, ask to speak to a manager. The truth is that most Apple employees would rather you buy iPhones and jailbreak them than buy Android phones because Apple is heavy-handed with its policies on software modification. **TLDR: Any Apple employee that forces you to update or covertly updates your phone against your will is breaking policy. If your issue is not demonstrably related to software modification, there is no reason they shouldn’t proceed with repair. You may have to speak to a manager. Be calm, concise, and polite. *Please* back up your data in case the battery tabs break and they provide a new device.** I’ll be glad to answer any questions I can. Update: Y'all chickenheads down voting my shit don't matter."}

I'm proud to finally release Titan, now available on [Chariz]( Here's a summary of its key features. **Auto PiP** Just like on iPad, pip will be started with an animation when exiting an app, opening a notification, etc if you’re in the middle of watching anything. You can see what that looks like [here]( . **Toggles/Activator support** You can set any activator action to toggle pip for those apps that do not include a button. Titan also comes with two similar toggles included if you don’t wish to use activator. **Smart Positioning** This automatically tries to figure out where navigation and tab bars are then moves the pip window to not get in the way. This works with all the apps in the picture and more. Thanks again to all the people who helped me test this, this tweak wouldn’t be near as stable as it is without you."}

I probably didn’t read closely enough which might have caused this misunderstanding. No offense to the developer, but this tweak is really just glorified Siri Shortcuts that trigger when an app is opened (which can be done using the “automations” in the stock Shortcuts app), except it’s easier to use, less buttons to press, doesn’t have the annoying notification, and also deactivates when closing the app. There are some useful ones that can’t be accomplished with Shortcuts like the “hide stock notifications” feature, but most of them can be done with simply a Shortcut containing the single action (Wifi, Brightness, Cellular, Airplane Mode, Low Power Mode, etc). You can downvote me all you want. This tweak is still very useful and I’m not degrading the developer’s work, I just want people to be informed before they purchase the tweak."}

I'm so exited to release Appaze 2, the obvious successor of...[Appaze]( &#x200B; The initial goal of Appaze was to allow per-app volume/brightness customization. People quickly asked me to add the ability to also set per-app toggles (Orientation Lock, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, etc), so I've updated Appaze to add support for toggles. But as it wasn't the inital purpose, the UI/UX wasn't thought in that way... Then, I saw a Control Center UI concept on Reddit, and I told myself that it would be awesome to use it in Appaze. And with iOS 13 new 3D Touch Menu, I knew it was time for a rewrite. &#x200B; **Appaze 2 lets you customize up to 17 settings for each app, in a clean and friendly UI, easily accessible right from 3D Touch Menu!** &#x200B; Every time you will use a customized app, **all chosen settings will be applied when entering the app, and restored to their previous values when leaving**. &#x200B; **Here is the full list of available settings:** Volume, Brightness, Orientation Lock, Bluetooth, Cellular, Wi-Fi, Airplane, Do Not Disturb, Auto Brightness, Location, VPN, Auto Screen Lock, Low Power Mode, Night Shift, Ringer, Dark Mode, Hide Stock Alerts (hide stock alerts like Low Battery alerts). &#x200B; The last setting will prevent any stock alert to show up, like the Low Battery one. Combined with DND toggle, it ensures a uninterruptible experience There're so many scenarios for each app! &#x200B; The UI comes with a Dark and a Light theme, and could be customized to your liking so that it only shows the toggles you're interested in. &#x200B; I really hope you'll like it! &#x200B; **It's compatible with all devices from iOS 11 to 13. iPad support is included.** &#x200B; [It's available on Packix for 2,49$.]( If you previously bought Appaze, you'll automatically get 50% off!

Install Terminal.(e.g. New Term 2) 4. Connect your iDevice② that you would like to restore to iDevice① and then set iDevice② to DFU mode. ( connection method is explained at below. ) 5. Run “sudo usbmuxd -U usbmux -f” ( Not nesessary but should do. ) 6. Run “idevicerestore --latest”. If you would like to erase user data, run “idevicerestore --erase --latest” instead of “idevicerestore --latest”. 7. Just wait for finish. ------------------------------ The most important thing that I forgot to tell you is that you have to prepare “Lightning to USB camera adaptor” or “Lightning to USB3 camera adaptor” to connect iDevice to iDevice :) Other connection methods are not reliable. 【Connection method】 iDevice① - Lightning to USB camera adaptor or Lightning to USB3 camera adaptor - USB to Lightning cable - iDevice② Sorry for my terrible English. ＊Do it at your own risk. ＊This method is power of him. @Diatrus(Twitter)"}

Today, [this post was made]( asking us to force [Release] posts to have the cost in the title/post. Our response to this is not exactly what was requested, but we think it's a good solution. So starting now, any post that wants to use the [Release] post will get an Automod removal message explaining that they need to use the [Free Release] tag or the [Paid Release] tag. We are not forcing developers to put the price in the title, but we request that they do for the user's sake. So to clarify, putting the price in the title is optional, but saying if its paid or free is mandatory. Additionally, we will be keeping the Release **flair** as-is. So if you make a post using the free or paid tag, your post will automatically get the release flair just like usual. One last clarification: **This will only apply to releases**, not updates and not upcoming. If you have any questions, feel free to leave them in the comments or send us a modmail. Edit: Another clarification, if the package is paid but has a free trial, we suggest it should be marked as paid but mention in the title about a free trial. -r/jailbreak Mods"}

Velvet is the notification tweak you were waiting for. Simple but highly customizable. Individually customize banners, lockscreen notifications and media player without needing to respring – ever. ### Two different appearances with a ton of options The modern Velvet appearance removes the notification header for a more minimal appearance while the classic iOS appearance keeps it and let's you customize it. Both appearances offer you a big variety of options to customize your notifications to make them fit your setup. ### Simple, yet highly customizable Whether you prefer manually tweaking every bit of the settings or just want a clean look right after installation, Velvet has you covered. Every single setting is easy to understand and can be mixed with almost any other settings for a unique look. ### The colors you deserve Want some color in your life? Velvet offers you the possibility to color the background, the borders, indicators and more in the color of the App Icon! For a detailed list of all features, please take a look at the depiction on Chariz. ------------------- ### More screenshots? Sure, you can find them in the depiction on Chariz or [right here]( ### Which devices and iOS versions are supported? All devices on iOS 13 should be supported. We tested it on several iPhones and one iPad. ### Where can I get it? You can get Velvet now on [Chariz]( for $2.99. ### What about those sexy wallpapers? [We got you covered]( ------------------- We are really happy to finally release this. The first teaser was published over two months ago, and we've been working on it ever since, so we're eager for some feedback from you now! Let us know what you think about it and have a nice day everyone :)"}

The Jailbreak is reliable, has a better Cydia approved by saurik that will not conflict with saurik's versioning, it does not drain the battery, performs the necessary cleaning itself if you switch from Electra or other tools (so no Rollectra needed) and it has a ton of settings you can mess with for enabling / disabling tweaks, setting NONCEs, etc. It also sports the Cydia substrate. The source code is Pwn's with no bits of Electra and this one performs a correct remount, unlike Electra that uses a hfs struct in an apfs mount.... Overall: Switch. It's well worth it from my testing, at least on iOS 11.3.x where I tested. DID NOT TEST ON iOS 11.0 / 11.1.2"}

Its main purpose is to map out all the cell towers that are in your local area. It does this through all on device measurements, meaning it's always up to date. The tower you are currently using, will have a green outline, and a green line going to it. What makes it different from App Store apps that do the same? Apps on the App Store, can not use this method of on device measurements to calculate where towers are. This means that it might not work in locations, or be outdated. Bug Support: If you have found a bug you want help fixing, shoot me a DM on Twitter and I will help you as fast as I can. In the future, updates will come out to increase the data that the app can show, to more detailed measurements. Note: No data leaves your device, meaning that your location data is safe. Due to the measurements of towers being done on device, there is no guarantee that they will be 100% accurate, and there may be bugs in this system, a recommended fix is to Purge the Database from the apps information page."}
