Brave works good on Android but Firefox+Ublock origin is highly recommended as it is the most stable and flexible since ublock is lightweight and supports custom filters. Time to go full browser mode on these companies. Block their crap. Don't give them a cent."}

Public means public, but a lot of Mastodon users want to have privacy *despite* their public servers and wide-open API, something that's just not logically feasible. It's a good instinct to have, but it's not based in how the Fediverse is designed. Just look at the responses to this thread, [where someone discovered a search engine for Mastodon users]( As far as I can tell, the developer wasn't even malicious... I couldn't find a record of the time a malicious person *did* make a search engine. I think the problem is that the public websites are currently small and obscure, and they haven't been subjected to the same sort of scrutiny as a big site like Twitter. But they are equally, if not more, accessible to anyone who is interested. > I just wanted a Twittrr alternative that doesn't sell my data, and I can feel safe using it Not selling your data, and being safe on the platform, are two different things. Here's a couple examples 1. I create a company with two subsidiaries, a nonprofit mastodon instance that promises to never sell your data, and a for-profit that scrapes the instance's data and sells it. I don't know if that's legally viable, but it's very possible and technically true. 2. When a big server has an open API, they don't need to sell your data for it to be taken. Any company, including AI ones, can swoop in and simply take it. >for the third one, I think that privacy and security of these servers are only as good as how much skilled and experienced the admins are, because as far as I seen the terms of service are pretty basic ( they don't give you 1000 pages to read, like Twitter and Reddit ), just the generic stuff, like be nice to others ...etc.. The problem isn't intentions, it's more that the ability to run a Mastodon instance does not mean you have the ability to keep it secure. I say that as someone who's started a lot of different servers for a lot of products, all on my free time. I like to think I'm clever, but I barely trust myself to keep my own data secure. Most of it is encrypted before it ever touches a server."}

The software itself is privacy agnostic by design; there are some privacy features which I applaud, but it has no incentive to go out of its way to scrape data about you.

Is that correct? XF source code is pretty much just PHP scripts, so yeah, once you buy it, you have the full source for the current version and can also download all the other past versions, should you so desire. There's also lots of developer documentation on how to edit the code to better suit your site plus there's an API you can take advantage of that's ready to go out of the box. It's just such a premium solution and it really is worth every penny. It's what vBulletin 5 and beyond should have been and it also makes other proprietary forum solutions like Invision look stupid. > How is the privacy aspect (if not covered by \"very secure\")? It's a pretty boilerplate affair. We use 1st party cookies and IP addresses to save settings and differentiate between users, respectively. Nothing more. Sanctuary is also set up to where you don't even need an account to do most things on the site. Of course, the obvious stuff such as having a unique username, profile customization, and posting in polls require an account. Although you don't need an account to make a thread or post. > How would XF fit the niche for Reddit leavers, say? We offer a forum that uses minimal rules to maintain order but still maintain full freedom of speech. There is nobody above me or beside to gainsay that or \"do a takeover\". The rules are set in stone. Everyone follows them. No more, no less. And I ensure that that happens at all times, not just for community members, but for ALL of the site team as well. There is no mod that can have a hissy fit and start banning people off sub-forums without me having a say in it. If they slack off and aren't fulfilling their positions properly, I will know as well. This contrasts with Reddit's infamously bad or even utterly non-existent handling of subreddit mods. I also have implemented an easy Digital User Signature system that allows full verification of anyone on any site at any time as long as you have their posted Verification Codes. Due to this, nobody can impersonate me. Only I know my Digital User Signature to verify my actions, and my DUS is not stored on any computer or storage device whatsoever, so it can't be stolen. This ensures that any time with any host or any site, I can verify who I am 100% without a doubt. Also, one of the many pluses we offer over Reddit, although it may not seem like it, is no voting system. We will not ever have one. This is by design due to the masses of issues inherent in such a system. It has zero benefit and only has downsides, enforcing Tyranny of the Majority. On Sanctuary, every post stands alone, unmarked and uncensored (as long as it follows the rules of course), there for you alone to decide whether it is good or bad or something in between. You are not told what to think. You are instead made to ask questions. There's so much more I could talk about, but that's a general summary of some of the things. > Seems to be a friction and barrier to entry that prevents the unwanted noisy entropy of mainstream platforms. Is that your experience? I am a HUGE believer in the old forum format and firmly believe that we need to get back to those as our main form of social media. On Sanctuary, the usual idiocy has MUCH less momentum behind it when there's no stupid upvote system to magnify and spread the stupidity. People now have to make an intelligent post that actually makes some damn sense or else it will get dismissed and tossed aside. Of course, I'm not going to pretend that forums cure every kind of social ill on other platforms. You're always gonna have bad posters and you're never gonna escape that. However, the design and format of forums at least ensures that such bad posters aren't really going to get far, and especially with the rules I crafted specifically over painstaking discussion and debate. > If Reddit really goes down, who or what will rise? Hopefully us. :) > Don't some Web3 sites (Odysee, LBRY) already fit that niche of host user videos and files? I've actually thought about this a bit. I guess we have a couple upsides compared to them. Although the protocol definitely allows anyone to post anything, Odysee and LBRY can and are required by US law to filter out what is publicly shown. On Sanctuary, we are our own site hosted off-shore and locked down, so we decide what is correct and not correct. And we decide that through the rules. The only thing we would add to them if we were to go through with this is a few copyright rules. As a very general rule of thumb with a couple exceptions, we're thinking no copyrighted uploads that aren't older than 20 years to the day. Another thing that Sanctuary offers over those two other sites is that we have a full general-purpose forum directly attached to the file and video hosting portion of the site, so people can post files and also discuss things all in one convenient place that has a very good ruleset. Sorry for the long reply, but I really wanted to be thorough. lol"}

There is also growing commitment among many subreddits, some larger than r/PrivacyGuides, to \u201cblack out\u201d their communities on June 12th for 48 hours in protest of these changes. As part of the top 5% of communities on the platform by size, we would like to participate in this event, given how detrimental I believe these changes to Reddit are. However, I\u2019m not going to force this upon all of you if you folks don\u2019t believe we should close off this community. Please let us know what you think about the protest and these changes! P.S. Check out our new community on Lemmy if you haven\u2019t already, I\u2019ll admit it isn\u2019t quite as nice as Reddit yet, but it\u2019s quickly getting there, and getting more regular community members on Lemmy will really help to shape the future of the culture on that platform :)"}

The entire thing is in \"active development\" and incomplete according to their documentation, which turned me off from trusting it as a potential home for a federated r/PrivacyGuides community. I think that **from a user perspective** Kbin should absolutely work great, and I would definitely encourage checking it out, but I also hope you all understand why we went with Lemmy from a community hosting perspective. Of course you can always join us at [ :) Problems with the main Lemmy instance are one of the main reasons I'm hosting my own, and I do block the \"Lemmygrad\" server from federating.

Then there is a lot of properties and behaviors that you cannot randomize. A good fingerprinting tool will not come up with a randomized useless fingerprint when you randomize some properties. It will instead focus on what is not randomizable first, detect what is randomized and instead of using the randomized value will use the fact that it is randomized as the value and in the end use fuzzy matching so that even if you successfully deceive it in some aspects it will still match the fingerprints because the other aspects may be enough to identify you.

LibreWolf's fingerprinting protection is mostly or entirely from Firefox features that are in large parts a result of the Tor upstream project that merges Tor Browser features into mainline Firefox. LibreWolf's fingerprinting protection is a reduced version of that of Tor Browser. It for example does not have letterboxing. LibreWolf sources a lot of its configuration changes from arkenfox. Arkenfox itself recommends to use Tor Browser if a higher level of anonymity is necessary. Brave also focuses a lot more on convenience and comparability than strong anonymity. It is based on chromium which unlike Firefox does not have any anonymity features integrated and is not designed to resist fingerprinting. Brave's shields are rather bolted on top than a systematic fingerprinting defense. They are not designed for full anonymity in the first place. Furthermore fingerprinting is not just about the browser but also about other layers like the network layers and a combinaof them. If you just use LibreWolf or Brave you will also carry information on the network level. Either if you do not use a VPN this will be a lot information that can circle in fingerprinting very much by your approximate location and ISP or if you do use a VPN your VPN provider is also valuable information for fingerprinting. Besides and unrelated to fingerprinting without using Tor you will not be anonymous on the network level and either your ISP or your VPN or proxy provider will see all your internet traffic."}

If you complain on one with a few thousand users, especially one without a firmly cemented privacy policy or terms of service... Good luck, I guess.

I'd venture to guess that for many industries, it's the single most important software they deploy. Likewise, other Office products have deal breaking features which are essential elements for many industries. For example Outlook's rule management system, it's access delegation features, and Word's Revision tools to name only a few big ones off the top of my head. Then there's other key software products that integrate into Office. Microsoft Office is VERY entrenched in the business world. The moment you need any kind of specialized business software for anything but small businesses, chances are you'll need an MS Office programs to leverage them fully. Not always, but it's common enough to not warrant the hassle for most businesses to actively monitor for Office alternatives. I'm not saying this is good, or that I'm happy about it. I love FOSS, donate to projects that I like frequently, and proactively hunt for privacy-friendly FOSS alternatives for software I use. It's just the unfortunate state of things."}

From what I read some people believe that using the defailt user.js arkenfox provides lumps you into a small subset of users. And then modifying it to my liking is probably making me more unique. I'm not sure, browser fingerprinting is still something I don't completely understand. Perhaps its best to just use default Tor whenever I want to avoid fingerprinting and use a basic version of Firefox for everything else."}

From me comparing them it does look like it would be nearly identical as using ClearURLs. So if you just want it to be like ClearURLs, then go for it. The other list is more hand made from the community reporting missing ones, or issues with some being removed. I personally really like that as it's a lot more what open source is about, the community, and it has a lot more real life working scenarios. It's constantly being updated for edge case scenarios and lesser known sites. But options are always great and I don't really see a down side from having both.

But how about `inline script` (I don't know if it can block `inline script` or not), `frame, xhr, beacon, websocket`, or tracking pixels that a website sends to their server, or tracking parameters in a URL?"}

How to use Discord as private as possible Guide", "content": "##Some general background Discord is a privacy and security disaster. They do not make their money through ads and tracking (as of now) but they do not care about privacy or security just the slightest bit either. Discord messages are not end to end encrypted. Discord, their employees and their infrastructure partners like Google Cloud Messaging have access to your messages at all time. Do not ever send anything sensitive over Discord! Discord also does *not* delete your messages when you delete your account, leave a server or delete a channel or group. When you delete a channel or group or get removed from one your messages still stay on their server. You just lose access to them and have no way to delete them anymore. If you delete your account without deleting your messages first they will stay on their servers forever without you having any way to access or delete them. There is no official way for deleting all your messages. I am not a lawyer, but I am very sure that is a violation of the GDPR and highly illegal. They claim they anonymize that data when you delete your account, but all your messages are still tied to an account ID and there is no way to anonymize private messages that can contain personal information. Using client mods to automate deleting messages is even against their TOS. They do not comply with laws that require them to delete your data and reserve the right to ban you when you try to do that yourself. You should absolutely regularly delete your messages anyways. Make sure to have another mean of contact for your Discord friends so you do not rely on Discord as they can and do of course ban you for any or no reason whatsoever. Discord also has extremely extensive telemetry that is *not* anonymized. They basically log every click you make in the app: when you click on a profile, when you join a voice channel etc. You can see this data when you do a GDPR request. Included in this logs is your IP address, your rough location and device information for every single event. You can block some of this with uBo in a browser or with client mods. ##Settings in Discord * Opt out of personalization and other data sharing. * Set yourself to invisible/offline. Everyone on every server can see when you are online otherwise and there are bots collecting this information. ##Modifications * If you can, use Discord in a browser with uBlock Origin. * Regularly use a script like [this]( to delete your messages. * Consider using a VPN to hide your IP address and location. * If you use their mobile app do not grant it storage permission and instead share files from your gallery or file manager with Discord. ##Usage Assume that absolutely everything you do on Discord \u2013 every message you send every word you say in a voice channel, every click you make \u2013 gets permanently recorded by Discord and secrete services, gets sold to advertisers either right away or in the future and breached to the public in the future. That is exactly what you risk when using Discord. Use it accordingly and do not share anything sensitive. If you need to discuss something private shift to another platform.

They're essentially like user accounts for browsers. Things like your history and data are kept contained to each profile.

You can achieve a similar (but not the same, I think) thing with [\"Multi-Account Containers\" in Firefox]( so you can contain Discord without resorting to using an entirely different profile. For the uBlock Origin bit, uBlock Origin can accept URLs from you to block. [The URLs given by the OP are apparently what Discord uses to gather data from their users]( To block them, click on the uBlock icon, and then the gears icon on the bottom right. This should open a new tab. Click on the \"My filters\" tab at the top, and you can paste in `||discord.com/api/*/science`, which would start blocking URLs that fit that pattern. As far as I can tell, the `||` just means it's a filter, and the wildcard means that any phrase can fit there, such as the various \"v9\",\"v10\",\"v11\", so on and so forth. As dansupreme notes though, **you shouldn't need to do this**. It comes baked into the EasyPrivacy set of filters (visible on the \"Filter lists\" tab), which is enabled by default."}

Off the top of my head, Matrix is missing: - Voice chat (NOT the same as voice calls, or meeting rooms). Just a voice channel that's always there and needs a single click to join. - Grouping by 'server' like discord, guilded, revolt do, matrix has channels that are fragmented and spread out. They also have the spaces thing, but that's confusing because you don't *have* to be in it, and they are hard to find, so it's very easy for someone to not see a group channel because they don't realize it exists. - Speed, joining a large channel can take forever. Even just logging in can take a few seconds. - Low latency game streaming to a voice channel. - Low latency screen sharing to a voice channel. - When I last tried it, the ability to get custom sticker packs or emojis was an absolute nightmare. In general the experience using matrix is just that it's slow, almost everything feels really laggy. Joining a channel, leaving a channel, forgetting a channel, making a meeting room, and so on. I ran my own homeserver for awhile to try and get around the speed issues, but it didn't really help. The server also kept using more and more space as it ran."}

To be honest, I don\u2019t know much, so take everything I say with large amounts of salt. What the uBlock stuff mentioned earlier is trying to do is different from what Auto Cookie Delete does. Auto Cookie Delete seems to be mainly used for sanitization. If you\u2019re okay with being logged out of Discord every time you close the browser, then I would stop keeping its cookies. Other than that though, I don\u2019t *think* there\u2019s much I can advise you here on. It should be safe to stop keeping IndexDB and LocalStorage, as I don\u2019t think Discord uses those. It might be safe to stop keeping Service Workers, but it might break additional stuff. Thing is though, aside from the cookies one, I\u2019m not sure if doing any of the rest provides any privacy benefits. Even the cookies one is less important than it used to be now that we have Total Cookie Protection on Firefox ([Brave also has a feature like that, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re using]("}

I'm Spike, the developer of Libreddit, an alternative private front-end for Reddit. I've been working on the project for about a year now and I'm excited to share it here. I know this is r/PrivacyGuides not r/PrivacyTools but I felt that people here would still be interested in this project. I wrote to the mods several days ago but I haven't received a response. To any moderators: Let me know if I should reupload at a different time. &#x200B; **10 second pitch:** [Libreddit]( is a portmanteau of \"libre\" (meaning freedom) and \"Reddit\". It is a private front-end like [Invidious]( but for Reddit. Browse the coldest takes of [r/unpopularopinion]( without being [tracked]( * Fast: written in Rust for blazing fast speeds and memory safety * \u2601\ufe0f Light: no JavaScript, no ads, no tracking, no bloat * Private: all requests are proxied through the server, including media * Secure: strong [Content Security Policy]( prevents browser requests to Reddit **How does Libreddit enhance my privacy?** Reddit tracks [a lot of data]( but Libreddit logs nothing and uses no JavaScript by default so client-side monitoring isn't possible. There are 35 community-hosted instances that can be used to access Libreddit; one can spread their traffic across multiple for even more privacy. 7 of our instances are .onion hidden services so you can browse Libreddit using Tor. **Can I use it to login to Reddit?** Libreddit doesn't currently support logins but using cookies, users can subscribe to subreddits, follow users, and [import their subscriptions from Reddit]( **Does Libreddit have any features not offered by Reddit?** On top of the minimalist design, Libreddit is very customizable with: 1. 10 themes to choose from 2. A toggle to enable Wide UI (for those of you who like to maximize your screen space) 3. Filters so you can hide certain subreddits or users from your feeds &#x200B; **Official Instance:** [ *\u2190 If this gets too slow due to traffic,* [use another instance]( &#x200B; **GitHub:** ["}

This is just what I've wanted been looking for.

No, the answer is no. c) They spread scams/malware: Google-ads has a reporting feature, so they somewhat keep this under control. But ALL ad platforms **must have** a way to quickly report an ad. If Mozilla can work these issues out with ~~Facebook~~ Meta, then It seems reasonable to enable ads. I'd love to support the creators whose content I enjoy.

Instead they are essentially being paid to be a consultant for Facebook to help them do ads better. So nothing about Firefox the browser is changing as far as we know. An open source privacy conscious company is being asked to help shift another company more in that direction. Isn\u2019t this what we want? Of course I realize this could be selling out and hopefully Firefox doesn\u2019t turn to the dark side.

Advertising generally, and internet advertising specifically, is destroying our society and it must be opposed and blocked in every way, shape, or form.

They have to get paid _somehow_ if they're trying to make their living doing such things, right? You might argue that they could depend on Patreon and voluntary donations, and sure, that works for some people. But there's a reason you see more and more independent creators on YouTube getting episodes sponsored by e.g. SkillShare or Brilliant or CuriosityStream or HelloFresh or whatever (just some of the ones I've seen), often **in addition** to their Patreon stuff. And those are a form of advertising as well, aren't they? So are you against those as well? And if they're not supposed to paywall anything, then Patreon subs should strictly serve as a form of donation (no perks), which would likely tank the number of Patreon patrons as well tbh (I'd personally continue donating, but that's just me...). Under a strictly no-advertising model, what I've realized is that the number of independent creators (who do this as their *livelihood*, I'm not talking about people who blog or create other content on the side \u2014 they'll be just fine) will shrink, and the number of creators who are parts of large networks (which can subsidize that content based on other media revenue) will increase. So what you're suggesting will lead to further centralization of media and media voices and an even *greater* control over the media by the 'establishment' (old media giants, big corporations, and so on). Not only is this bad for a diversity of voices (no matter which way you slice that statement), but it also further allows a handful of companies to control the public discourse. Again, if all you care about is hobbyist creators who don't depend on this kind of stuff for their livelihood, then sure, this model works okay. But I, for one, want to see the Internet remain a place where you _can_ actually get a diversity of voices (unlike traditional media). And what I've realized is that hobbyist creators just don't factor into that (hell, I lump myself into that category, since I had/have a blog that I occasionally post stuff to). My main gripe with advertising and the way it's controlled right now is that the creators themselves get a *miniscule* share of the money, even though their content is what is pulling in the ad clicks (or views). That and privacy issues, of course. I also find ads annoying (who doesn't), but I've realized that we haven't really come up with another way of enabling independent professional creators in a systematic way, and independent professional creators are what set the Internet apart from traditional media. They're what make it a vibrant place and what allow new stories and new perspectives to be seen and heard."}

Great. >A website which publishes content only commercially is no better than traditional media in my opinion. Most of the \"professional\" online \"journalism\" is a joke anyway. I heavily disagree. Earlier, you _had_ to be accepted by major TV stations or major newspapers in order to be heard. Now, you can start a smaller newspaper/magazine like The Intercept or Current Affairs and actually _be heard_. And these provide perspectives, opinions, and facts that otherwise might not get heard at all (because they're \"inconvenient\"). >If you think you have something important to say that you want others to heard, you would do it for free, like it used to be in the \"old Internet\". As an example, your Reddit post probably took a while to write but you didn't get paid for it. I'd be pretty pissed if writing Reddit posts were my profession and I wasn't getting paid for it, though. >Content will still be created for free, because people want to share information and opinions. As for the rest, I don't care - someone else might pay for it, in that case it's not my problem, or they shut their \"business\" down, in that case also not my problem. You may not care, but it matters because the Internet is a gleam of hope for getting rid of the stranglehold on public discourse that traditional media has had for a long time. And if smaller independent news outlets and magazines don't have a way to monetize in a way that is sustainable, then the Internet becomes yet another place that traditional media has colonized. The \"old internet\" was free because no one made it their livelihood. Things that went up for free on the Internet were subsidized by money made through more established means (e.g. print or TV media). And, by the way, everyone had to pay for most of those other forms of media _and_ they had to endure ads. Think about that for a second. What you're suggesting is not only shortsighted, it will kill independent media. And right now, that's all that's preventing a complete and total control of the public discourse by big, multinational conglomerates. Already, something like [90% of American media is controlled by 6 giant companies]( While the exact numbers may have changed slightly (due to spin-offs and mergers), the general principle still holds. That remaining 10% is extremely important, and it's what allows other voices \u2014 voices that disagree with the mainstream neoliberal narrative \u2014 to be heard. Until and unless that independent media has a way to monetize that is sustainable, I will never be on board with fully getting rid of advertising. I personally block ads and instead, I contribute to independent media outfits that I consume. But I understand why many smaller sites view advertising as a necessary evil. What I _absolutely refuse to support_ is targetted advertising and profiling (one of the main reasons I disable ads unilaterally)."}

Because those people who care about the original mission, be it FOSS, ethics, privacy, etc. will eventually leave - and those who don't care about these things, will stick around because the new course is not colliding with their principles. Eventually, the decision making is dominated by people who couldn't care less about previous goals/promises or what customers want. In a way, it's a self-fulfilling prophecy, because those people who care and notice detrimental changes simply abandon ship, leaving it to those with a different agenda - instead of fighting for the cause and trying to correct course. I don't know if this is happening to Mozilla, but I do know it has happened in other start-ups and companies before. And it's basically the same problem in other areas of life, such as people being disappointed in democracy, so they stop voting, which just gives more power to destructive forces - so ofc, things get worse over time because those interested in positive change pull back and stop influencing society in a meaningful way."}

It performs it's advertised goal well: Vanilla Chromium without depending on Google web services. (doing domain substitution on URLs in the codebase may be a bit weird/unproper/hacky, but it effectively reaches the goal without adding too much work). It's just that from a security standpoint it's not as good as other Chromium browsers because of a few things, such as they have patches removing component updates (a Google web service) which stops out-of-band security updates which Chromium does instead of making new releases, stops CRLSets from being updated without a new release, and Chrome web store integration which prevents auto-updating extensions from the Chrome web store (a Google web service). Personally I might consider removing the component update patch in my builds in the future. They don't necessarily strip features commonly deemed as privacy-invasive as it's not necessarily meant to be a browser that solves contemporary privacy problems (eg. though people (understandably) bring it up in privacy discussions because it does clearly and assuredly remove telemetry in Chromium as a byproduct. Seems like the article got rewritten, I overall agree with the writing a bit more now."}

They are both designed under the assumption that the application is only able to be accessed by a trusted user (via login information in the case of proton, and the phone login screen plus potentially an app PIN in the case of Signal), which is not at all unreasonable. Ultimately, Signal and ProtonMail *are* private to the degree that one can expect messaging applications to be (notably, privacy is separate from anonymity, although they often go hand in hand). They are meant to be part of a larger security model. Also, your point about \"the problem with E2EE systems\" makes no sense. What you're implying is that the user being able to access their data at any point is a security risk because someone else could potentially do the same thing \u2014 for example, if the data is only accessible on the end device but is freely accessible there, yes, anyone using the end device could access the data. In that case the threat model assumes that the end device is secure. If accessing the data is only possible on the end device *and* requires a PIN, then yes, an attacker who can access the device and knows the PIN can access the data. Fundamentally any system must define a point at which the user is trusted enough to access the data, otherwise what's the point? Ideally there should be as few points as possible where the data is accessible, which is precisely what E2EE accomplishes. Maybe you mean that they should use encryption-at-rest and decrypt data only when needed? If so, you might be interested to know that they *do*, last I checked."}

It\u2019s something we\u2019ll consider for the next video. The other thing I will note is that this video has performed exceptionally well on YouTube compared to our other videos, and as another commenter here pointed out, it is sort of the game you have to play on YouTube. The main purpose of these videos is to reach new audiences, and I think if the video content is good then these sort of games is a price we are willing to pay, because we are up against so much misinformation on other YouTube channels. **However,** I will also consider using different and more straightforward thumbnails and titles for our PeerTube uploads and posts to privacyguides.org/videos that our existing community sees (and sharing those to Reddit instead of YouTube).

My feelings are very conflicted on this. I think it is important to recognize both that: 1. He has (and hopefully will continue to) contribute greatly and meaningfully to privacy, security, and user control/autonomy over our devices and our data greatly. More than most people ever will. The work he has done with Graphene and with Copperhead before that have benefited us all. He has made great technical contributions to Privacy on Android and is a talented developer and deserves recognition and respect for that, I'm certain it was not always easy and often very thankless job. If he chooses to leave the project, losing his experience, knowledge, and dedication is a huge loss. 2. And at the same time, he often behaved in unacceptable ways, is an extremely socially abrasive and often acted in ways that were not stable nor constructive, and saw anyone that wasn't 100% deferential to him as an enemy out to get him and get grapheneOS. Many of us have personal experiences with this, and there are a couple well documented controversies as well. He did a lot for the project technically speaking and its existence is thanks mostly to him, but he also did a lot to push people away and alienate and bully people for the small things, perceived slights, or even technical disagreements, and overall contributed to a toxic and hostile culture in the sub community that harmed both the project and his own mental health. We all struggle in certain regards, and I truly and earnestly hope that he seeks the help he needs, or just takes a breather, and re-engages with the project in a more positive and healthy way. None of us are defined by just one aspect of ourselves, we are the sum of all parts, some good, some bad. We should be able to acknowledge the good and the bad and not rush to paint a black and white picture in either extreme."}

Sure it's not a security hardened as Graphene, but because of that it actually runs smoother and better on my 4a. I think the team behind that project does a wonderful job too.

And these are valid concerns that we should be aware of with respect to government intrusion into the right to privacy, regardless. However, there are a couple of considerations missing from your analysis: The RESTRICT Act is not intended to ban use of TikTok. It is intended to ban foreign adversaries from having an interest in IT services/technologies where that interest would pose a threat to national security. Upon enforcement, the President could force that foreign adversary to sell their interest. They may be able to ban the service/technology from the United States, but that would be done via geoblocking enforced at the app store level. In any event, if an individual were to circumvent such a block using a VPN, the law is not concerned with that behavior. What the RESTRICT Act is concerned with is covered transactions. A covered transaction occurs where a commercial transaction involving a foreign adversary or entity affiliated with a foreign adversary has or purchases an interest in an entity that provides or manufactures information services or technology. So an example of this being TikTok. The concern is that the government of China (foreign adversary) has an interest (ownership or partial interest) in an entity providing information services/technology (TikTok). Where the VPN becomes an issue is if a person acting on behalf of the Chinese government used a VPN to try and hide the fact that they are associated with the Chinese government in order to purchase an interest TikTok. When the Secretary of Commerce makes their assessment of that transaction, they would likely be able to back into information that would indicate a VPN was in use (ie - a person uses a VPN to appear to be in the US, but there are no records for the relevant time frame showing that they were in the US). That would be de facto evidence that could be confirmed by the intelligence community and/or other diplomatic channels (Dept. of State)."}

Flaw: A supply chain attack could cause the passwords to be sent to an online service without any encryption. KeePass\\* can be modified to send passwords remotely just like the services with cloud-sync as a built-in feature.

Having used both a fair bit I can tell you this: - 1Password while closed sourced, does have a [technical whitepaper]( which extensively discusses how it works. It also undergoes [security assessments]( by third parties [just like Bitwarden]( - I personally use Bitwarden, it works, well, though I admit 1Password's desktop apps are nicer. More stuff can be done in the 1Password desktop app than the Bitwarden one (export and some other things for example) - I think 1Password's UI is nicer, than Bitwarden, it has more record types, for example Bitwarden only has Login, Credit Card, Notes etc - The mobile apps for 1 Password are nicer, especially on iOS Both are really great products. Bitwarden might be a bit cheaper, I personally like the option of [self-hosting it with VaultWarden]( and using the official clients (that's what I do), however this may not be for all people. Self hosting requires effort, and it can be easier to just \"pay someone else\", to do that for you. For more information see Both have a trial, so try both, see which one you like more. Both have sane export formats in [JSON]( which means exporting of your data should always be fairly easy to implement in a new password manager. One of the major problems with things like KeepassXC is that it exports as a [CSV]( only, which means extra data like additional information added to a record, may not be imported, and you'll have to manually check that. I found that when migrating from KeepassXC to Bitwarden."}

I have ValutWarden installed and I have the BitWarden extension installed. But that's as far as I went. What stopped me was two things: 1. One big use-case for me is family sharing. I have no problem setting this up or maintaining it. But I'm not going to live forever. It would suck for my family members to lose access to their passwords after I could no longer maintain it. 2. Location of the storage of the encrypted vault isn't an concern at all for me. I'm perfectly happy to put it on [pastebin.com]( I wouldn't use any password manager if I thought the security of the system relied on keeping the encrypted storage secret. To me, it's a given that all the password storage products all function the same and encrypt the passwords properly. 3. The larger issue is with trusting that the Lastpass/KeePass/Bitwarden client is free of supply chain issues. And AFAIK I can't easily self host the BitWarden Chrome Extension. If an attacker were to modify the Chrome extension, the storage location of the encrypted password file doesn't matter. The attacker can choose to leak the unencrypted passwords wherever they want. As far as I can tell, all password managers are vulnerable here. There is no one best solution. Here's an example. I've encrypted a password here. I have no concerns about this \"vault\" being made public. I'm sure the crypto is implemented properly. Similarly the storage location of my encrypted password database isn't a concern to me. -----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE----- hQEMAxnJ037uhuiWAQf+NPQo9mS95Vn306VhYWymfaEAFcLMlmGoXIML/pGWfjxw 0r81smsiJTbpMQpSLFAPIzzS3qErGmcSvBGVvRKcqHolrKPgWgvKtnE8RVWhOMAp mv5dm7BBCkHFRY37OEvvoLA6fPQZUrzJCPQnKWCLf4S9m21Fprx+iROw5gRC8WNl b8SiHSiZakJcfzKVTihi8DuhDaz7QiS1tzzF+077CDIbEtuyvIe6SLb1hEetuJbV 0XAWBCdcXi3KkybAg9zPWsurw+W8p9h81O1w3GhvNBFRK65drGdVhCa0djgXxgJE PjRPDKKftXCjBYjWqiBIpRi6nAJtrfyfcVDynAVRedKBAWRRk9lHun483Mb2jwt7 7okZkQ12xa5BKSG1LExagBsnVLYh2CV7JucBhN8dIzFW1FqsWYn4voBjhDJXlffx 2oWGWDZejp7iZM9LIn1wmNVj5+57UjNdIgKmRzDRNK74jCUKP8ZIij9mx+yFVXIj vetaFuFt+MK8/zSdviSQ1bjE =Z/Je -----END PGP MESSAGE-----"}

So no family share to deal with. I use the free cloud based server at the moment. This all reminded me to look back into self hosting on my Synology NAS. Just to remove the cloud server vector. Having a paper backup in a safe place at home, or at the very least my master pass written somewhere in case something happens to me is probably a great idea actually. Any device I use is password and/or biometrics protected. So, ive covered all the security issues I can think of. Still, definitely nothing is bulletproof."}

That's why Chromium browsers tend to be memory hogs. Every tab you use is allocated an address space. I still use Firefox, and frankly most people who agree with me on this point still use it. Vivaldi is a very nice browser, I've used it as soon as I heard the guy who originally made Opera was behind it, and all the good memories I had on the DSi. Vivaldi also keeps up with Chromium updates better than Opera (1 week vs 1 month), which is good because the longer you're without important security patches, the worse off you'll be (on top of any hardening innovations out there you might be missing out) Personally, I'm not quite sure about Vivaldi's track record of privacy violations because frankly it doesn't have one. I don't like to judge solely on whether a product is open-source or not because even proprietary browsers can be audited, but given the fact that it's been hard to find information on Vivaldi's privacy violations, I think that speaks about its validity. My reasoning for using Brave is quite simple, and quite frankly pretty embarrassing. When I saw that the browser blocks access to the motion sensors on Facebook/Instagram, I was practically sold. I heard from the GrapheneOS main developer that it was possible to exploit motion sensors to work as an always on microphone with a startling albeit not perfect degree of accuracy, so this is one of the few times where I've seen motion sensor capability being implemented. My recommendation is to visit sites like this and figure out if they're trying to access your motion controls. As for the hardening guides, I'm still looking. I was certain it was from the Madaidan's Insecurities blog, but it appears not. It has been a long time."}

Is great, and Vivaldi users wants (me too) and extension for that. But like an user said me yesterday about why wasn't implemented already, is because that isolation which uses Firefox or Tor isn't a simple thing, because it was developed for almost a decade. Do you mean another kind of isolation? I didn't knew Chromium browsers already have a kind of isolation between tabs, is something like Firefox Containers? Which are the diferences between both? Is really good read about that thing of Vivaldi. Then you recommend me use Vivaldi as a privacy-friendly option for daily use with the addons I mentioned, for example? I really like it, although Firefox too. It's hard determine which would be better for a daily use. When I want something more privacy I use Librewolf or Mullvad, or Tor as last line. Interesting stuff about motion sensors, didn't heard never about it. How the motion sensors could works like a microphone? But then you are talking about Brave like your way to go on phone, isn't? (if yes, then do you use it in PC too or Firefox?) I was using it for a long time like my browser for phone *(also I have it installed on my Linux but I barely use it nowadays, when I use Windows sometimes I use it)*, and I have it installed yet, but switched to Mull when I knew of their existence and seems a really good option to me according everything I readed about it and their use. I personally don't use Facebook, but if is your case I understand totally your desire of protecting about it. Btw how I can figure out about motion control, which sites did you mean and what I need to do to know it? Letting Facebook behind, I barely use Instagram but I use instead Instander, which seems more reliable and privacy than the official app to me. WhatsApp I have installed just due a few persons and normal people who doesn't knows about Telegram or don't trust on it, and for an unknown reason they rather Whatsapp... *(I started using it with Insular, FOSS version of Island, which I installed to see how it works and to can use my recent reactivated TikTok account of the safest possible way. And works better than Island or Shelter for me, didn't had problems at all with their set up and to can clone apps to the work profile, no PC needed to do anything).* I think is more convenience than anything (about Whatsapp vs Telegram and their generalized use) and because people that don't interested in software, apps, FOSS or privacy just want the usual stuff, they don't like research about apps, F-Droid or privaciest or safest alternatives. Idk about that blog but I will do my research about it. And also will searching hardening guides to Brave, Vivaldi, whatever. That's great stuff to know and share. If you find them please, send me a DM. I have a lot of recollected PDFs too and guides about A LOT of things, some of them I don't know apply them or use it for now, like ethical hacking and programming languages (I want to learn Python, HTML, Java, Kotlin and more, and I have the goal of start to study a VT of Web Application Development, and maybe later Multiplatform Development). When a VT is finished, I would only need the second year of one of them because the first year is the same for both. There is a lot of things of learn of a lot of people that something we *''understimate'' them* with sarcastic comments, like my silly comment about *~~privacy~~* and Edge. Everyday is a new chance to be better and make autocriticism to improve our way of be, think and communicate with others. Have a good day or night friend, cheers!"}

Something is open source so it must be trustworthy and secure. How would it even be possible to insert a backdoor? The Linux kernel is a shiny example of this. It has thousands of eyes looking at it, how could any one maliciously put any vulnerabilities in it? Right? Right? Oh wait... [ 2. Every single thing made by Google and the so-called big tech is evil and must be avoided at all cost!!! Let's not even evaluate the technology itself - Chromium bad, Android bad, Fuchsia bad. Pixels are also bad. GrapeheOS bad cuz it needs a Pixel. Let's buy massively overpriced and not-so-secure Linux phones with horrible specs instead! After all, it's open source software and hardware right? Let's see... [ 3. Enumerating badness is a toadally valid approach to privacy issues. Let's just make massive blocklists, pile tons and tons extensions on top of each other, because blocking is good! Let's completely ruin the Android security model and install Adaway as root too because why not. Oh wait a minute... [ 4. Encrypted DNS is totally a valid replacement to a VPN or Tor. If you hide your DNS queries, there is no possible way the ISP can figure out what you are visiting, right? Wait what [ 5. 5G bad! I am so hopelessly dependant on the not-so-secure-or-private teleco network that I need them for cell connection but I don't wanna use 5G. Let me just buy EOL LTE phones instead!!! 6. Anything made by companies are inherently bad and evil. Anything made by the community must be good. Red Hat bad. Fedora bad cuz Red Hat. SUSE bad. openSUSE bad cuz SUSE. Ubuntu bad cuz Canonical. Manjaro and Debian must be good. Hold on for a second... [ 7. Proprietary software bad! Proprietary software obviously has backdoors. There is no way I will install any proprietary software on my beautiful Debian install. Wait, I need to install the proprietary microcode updates to fix a critical vulnerability with my CPU? Oh noes! [ 8. Shifting trust is a perfectly good idea. ProtonMail is a honeypot because they comply with lawful government requests. Lemme switch to Tutanota instead. They sure will break the law and go to jail for me cuz privacy, of course. Wait what... [ 9. Decentralization good. Centralization bad. Who needs nuances. Why even bother evaluate the technology on their own merits? VPNs are bad cuz of the supposed centralization. Everyone should just use random DNS servers with DOH instead! Or alternatively, just use dVPN, right? Decentralization good. Oh wait... [ 10. More encryption = better. Let's just do VPN over Tor over VPN. Who cares if it breaks anonymization features such as Isolated Stream. There is no way the FBI is gonna catch me if I am behind 7 proxies, right?"}

However, generally it is true that: * Free and open source > open source > proprietary * Decentralized > centralized * FOSS which is not based on Big Tech software (Linux phones, Firefox) > FOSS based on Big Tech software (AOSP, Chromium) And the reason for this is not necessarily immediate privacy or security, like the Madaidan examples that Android has better security than GNU/Linux phones, or that Chromium has (had?) better security than Firefox. It's sustainability. Preventing monopolies and vendor lock-in. This is a necessity if you want to make sure your private, secure application will still be a viable choice in a few years."}

Thank God, there are still reasonable people in this sub. The only small disagreement I have, is with the enumerating badness approach.

With a good ad blocker like Brave's built-in or uBlock Origin you may not see a single ad for years of surfing. This shows, that enumerating badness can work pretty well. Of course this shouldn't be achieved with high cost, like the mentioned rooting of Android, which is a no-go."}

Red Hat told the CentOS council that they wanted to shift focus to CentOS Stream and the CentOS council just decided to kill off CentOS themselves. Red Hat is nice enough to give you 16 licenses for free now. RHEL still remains open source and you can use any downstream rebuilds if you'd like. I personally wouldn't. CentOS was always behind RHEL and lacks some services like Red Hat Insights. Going from CentOS to RHEL if you have <= 16 machines is a massive upgrade. 10. It doesn't work that way.

For example, if you wish to check what connections a program makes and what it sends: you MITM it (& not by reading the source code) - and you can do this with any program, closed or open. Does one find vulnerabilities by reading the source code, & does one find anything fishy by reading the source code? 99% of the time the answer is no. Instead, researchers reverse engineer, fuzz, etc. software to find the aforementioned as reading the source code is a often a flawed and insufficient method for finding the above. Understand that I\u2019m not hating on open source, I\u2019m just saying its development model is next to negligible."}

Of course, for this to apply the project needs to be popular enough, so someone regularly checks the changes. Unless that's true, you either check the code yourself or it's blind, unwarranted trust. I can't avoid saying that I think your stance on this point is a bit unnecessarily hostile to open source. You basically say that OPEN SOURCE CAN'T BE TRUSTED, THEY ARE LIARS!!! While the actual thing is, that blind trust never was good. This on one hand brings with itself that closed source software is harder to trust, because you can't verify what it does, and on the other hand it also means that open source software projects shouldn't be trusted any more *until* you do the efforts in some way to verify the claims of the author; let it be reading the code or finding someone you trust that has already did it and reading their review. To the point again that blind trust never was good: I think this is the point of this sub, but very rarely it is said, and when we speak about software we automatically forget this, and as a result suddenly it's either OPEN SOURCE BAD or OPEN SOURCE GUD at any oss software project that gets recommended here."}

Right, I made the mistake of not defining what do I mean by blind trust. For me, blind trust is things like trusting by number of stars, downloads, or just because it is on GitHub. What isn't, again, for me, is if the developer/maintainer/whoever gained credibility by their work in a more technical community, where there are people who are willing to check the code. It's kind of a property of popular projects: if you want to contribute, you need to check the code to understand what is happening, so you are able to make your modifications. Or if you just want to learn from a popular project how do the pros do programming in x language or with x tools, methodology, whatever, you check how do they do it I still think this is better than trusting a closed source project, because it's much harder to verify a binary blob than the source code (significantly less people will do it, and chances are also higher that they miss an important thing while analyzing the binary or maybe assembly code), and from human nature even the incentive is higher to do something people wouldn't like, because it's probable enough that they won't notice. > At the end of the day, unless you compile from source, you still have blind trust in whoever compiles it for you. Reproducible builds. Don't believe the binaries were compiled from those sources? Compile it yourself and compare the binaries by content.

That is your own very weird interpretation of what I am saying. I am specifically making fun of is the way you are granting people trust. Trusting the number of stars on a GitHub repo is no different than trusting 5 stars review for a piece of proprietary closed source software. All it means is that there is a lot of interest in it, it doesn't mean anyone other than the developers have actually reviewed the code. And even if the code was reviewed, there might be vulnerabilities inserted here and there that is very difficult to spot, as was the case with the vulnerabilities inserted into the kernel. Also, to your point of reproducible build - you gotta build it yourself first then compare the builds to make sure it matches. At the end of the day, you still have to compile your own stuff. And you still have to trust that there is no nasty backdoor in the source code that you are building from. Having access to the source code is always nice, but at the end of the day, you are still having blind trust in someone anyways.

But this can come at the cost of breaking more sites unless you manage where it's on or not. Firefox's built-in tracker blocking aims to break less websites, especially with a feature called SmartBlock (which is like a beefed-up version of uBo's surrogates feature). Having both on is probably a good idea because of this. Where you end up disabling uBo, you'll still have some protections on the same site with Firefox's built-in strict blocking (and in the rare cases where a site breaks with *both* of them, you can disable Firefox's protection using the shield icon, like you can with uBo's icon for its protections)."}

There is one thing about Facebook that never changed over the years and that is that they are persistent, no matter the cost they'll enforce it. This \"Metaverse\" garbage has been in the works for at least seven years (since they bought Oculus VR in 2014) and i doubt that they will give up on it if it won't catch on in the next 1 or 2 years. My beloved fellow humans please PLEASE think! Meeting your loved ones **in person is way better than sitting or standing in a room with a VR headset on**! Playing Basketball or visiting a concert with your fiends in real life can never be replaced by a VR \"experience\". Doing a crossover and swirling by your opponent on a Basketball court won't work with a heavy cable attached to your head. Jumping up and down with a friend in your arm won't work if the VR headset feels like it's going to fall off any moment, not to mention the physical contact that should be there but sadly isn't because you stand in an empty room and not in a jam-packed crowd. And no, VR/AR tech won't fit into your sunglasses any time soon no matter what Mr. Zuckerberg tells you. Save that VR/AR tech money and invest it in valuable face to face time with your friends, with the added benefit that Zuckerberg won't snoop in on you and your friends."}

We've had a pretty solid 10-ish year run of social media companies like Reddit being relatively stable platforms for communities to exist on, so I think it's easy to forget a few things: 1. Reddit **is** social media, with all of the privacy, ethical, and other concerns that are associated with that. Cutting it out of your life will be difficult, but I think we can make it through this :) 2. We really weren't particularly worse off before Reddit came around. Reddit is a glorified forum which provides some minor convenience features. Find some good, *actual* forums and lead the resurgence of the \"old-school\" internet again, in the long-term we'll all be better off. It **isn't** impossible to teach new people about privacy and security without building communities on Reddit, Facebook, etc. Perhaps it will be slightly harder, but we're up for the challenge. Thanks everyone, we hope to see you on more respectful platforms soon :)"}

This is not a vote after all, it's a discourse Unless the General Secretariat of the Council did not come up with this idea, they should be the one looked down upon. After all, they were the ones who introduced this topic very negatively from the get go with the whole save the kids. Regardless of that, my main gripe is that the article farms for your concerns and emotions while discussing a serious topic, while also misrepresenting the document in the title. (Makes it seem as if Spain came up with the idea)"}

Half a million people participated in the Proton Drive beta over the past year, including many of you here, so we want to thank you for all your feedback during the beta period. We started this project because our files and photos contain some of our most private information, yet there are no good ways to keep them safe. We want Proton Drive to be like a Swiss vault for your digital files and data, and that\u2019s why we really took the encryption to another level compared to other solutions. Proton Drive uses end-to-end encryption, all files are also signed and verified with cryptographic signatures. It\u2019s also compatible with the Address Verification feature of Proton Mail. Not only are files encrypted, but also file names, file extensions, and other sensitive metadata. Proton Drive is a secure, end-to-end encrypted storage solution to keep your private files safe. As always, we\u2019re here to serve you, so let us know what you would like improved and changed, and it\u2019ll happen. Find out more here: ["}

The team made a decision to migrate to this new domain \u2014 [privacyguides.org]( \u2014 in order to hopefully make the transition a lot more smooth. There is no telling if the original domain holder might return, and if we waited until the domain's expiration, it is likely we would have lost the domain entirely. Losing the domain would have posed massive problems for our SEO rankings, etc., so while we don't have full control over DNS on the PrivacyTools domain, our control of the webservers allows us to 301 redirect the site to our new domain in the meantime. Hopefully this gives everyone enough time to notice the change, update bookmarks and websites, etc. :) [Original Announcement]( **What about the source code on GitHub?** The source code on GitHub is currently archived at [ The source code for our new website is available at [ All updates from PrivacyTools have been merged into this new repository, and this is where all future work will take place. **What will happen to the** r/privacytoolsIO **subreddit?** Luckily, the existing Subreddit is controlled by our team member and long-time moderator u/trai_dep, however what we will do with it in the future is still to be determined. Most likely it will be shut down eventually in favor of this subreddit, it does not make sense to us to rebrand it \u2014 even though there is a clear benefit to keeping the existing community intact \u2014 because the name/URL itself can never be changed, so it seems like that would only serve to confuse newcomers. Hence the creation of r/PrivacyGuides! **~~Why is~~** r/PrivacyGuides **~~restricted?~~** ~~Our general feeling at the moment is that~~ r/privacytoolsIO ~~and~~ r/privacy ~~\u2014 in general \u2014 serve the same community and the same type of content.~~ ~~The plan we are currently considering is leaving this subreddit restricted, and asking users to discuss privacy and ask questions on~~ r/privacy ~~instead. It's a much larger community that we feel is likely better suited to that sort of thing. This subreddit will exist for commentary on official posts (like this!) from the team, blog posts and other website updates, and perhaps news updates and other posts from a small group of approved posters; rather than being open to posts by anybody.~~ ~~We are interested in hearing your thoughts on this plan though, let us know what you want to see!~~ **What's the plan with the new** r/PrivacyGuides **Subreddit?** We posted a bit about this on our latest [migration blog post]( >In the coming weeks our current plan is to wind down discussions on r/privacytoolsIO. We will be opening r/PrivacyGuides to lots of the discussions most people are used to shortly, but encouraging general \u201cprivacy news\u201d or headline-type posts to be posted on [r/Privacy]( In our eyes, r/Privacy is the \u201cwho/what/when/where\u201d of the privacy community on Reddit, the best place to find the latest news and information; while r/PrivacyGuides is the \u201chow\u201d: a place to share and discuss tools, tips, tricks, and other advice. We think focusing on these strong points will serve to strengthen both communities, and we hope the good moderators of r/Privacy agree :)"}

I always felt that it was more welcoming and you had more chance of getting an answer to your questions there, the same post on both subreddits would get completly different results, often straight up ignored in r/privacy. Also when they do get some traction r/privacytoolsIO sub often has more informative r/privacy also seemed more focused on discussing news and events related to privacy rather then helping those that have questions or are just starting out. It seemed that beginner questions werent really invited there although not actually blocked. r/privacytoolsIO subreddit bridged that gap helping newcomers getting started and feel confortable asking privacy related questions. i actually stopped following r/privacy because of that. i get that maybe duplicate subreddits might be redundant, but personally i think it would be a shame to completly loose the r/privacytoolsIO subreddit. Also it was mentioned that one of the reasons was bc r/privacy is a larger community, but that might actually be a con rather than a pro. Some posts might be deemed insignificant by others even though that post was important to you because you are new at this and are just trying to figure things out. Then the post wont get any traction and will be shadowed by other posts and you are left with an unresolved question/discussion."}

For example, in r/privacy, you might receive advice to use a burner phone for whatsapp *if* you care about facebook tracking you. In r/privacytoolsio, you\u2019d be told that uninstalling Whatsapp and losing all your work and personal connections is the right move just because it\u2019s not open source. In r/privacy you might be told that VPNs are not a silver bullet and to use what fits best for you. In r/privacytoolsio you\u2019d be mislead that \u201cany VPN operating in the US can\u2019t be trusted\u201d.

Everything seems so browser-focused atm, but we don't live inside the browser (even if we may spend a big chunk of our time in it today). Or our computers even. There was a thread about this a while ago, and it was like a breath of fresh air. Lots of interesting and useful advice on sharing personal data, emails, photos with friends, colleagues, other people; payment methods; wifi / 3g. Heck even clothing item, mask and accessory recommendations. It's all at the very least interesting and relevant to the goal of this sub. However, I don't know if following u/JonahAragon's suggestion on migrating to the bigger sub is such a bad idea.

Correct me if I'm wrong, u/JonahAragon, but I think we are prepared for these kinds of contingencies. We'd also like to develop working groups around aspects of running the organization, so that there are more clear lines of authority (in the sense that one or two people can reliably be counted on to be able to answer questions, resolve issues and this sort of thing). We'll still be highly collaborative, but better organized so that both hands know what the other is doing.

The crucial difference is that while YT mostly uses the data tracked internally (1st party tracking), TikTok uses the majority of it externally (3rd party tracking). The big deal is that 3rd party tracking makes it so that people can\u2019t possibly know what their data is being used for. Further than that, even exactly what TikTok\u2019s tracking is obscure enough. The national security claim comes from the fact that in China the government plays a huge party in the biggest companies of their country, which means this data could be used for a myriad of ill intended purposes by the Chinese government directly and we would even know. Things like industrial espionage (which doesn\u2019t limit itself to only things private companies can do, so it also includes things like military tech) and the unlawful monitoring of citizens by any nation should be enough of a concern to absolutely anyone."}

That's what I have noticed atleast. For any other links, just copy them and open in the choice of your browser. For a link for, say Twitter, you have to first convert it to Nitter (open source alt) in order to open it in the most private possible which is the hassle Untrack me saves you.

You'd want to keep lying now wouldn't you. Fines for a large enough company should always be percentage based.

So if the prosecutors feel like it, they can definitely impose a significantly heftier fine without having to raise the 4% ceiling. As to where the fines go, I don't really know. Definitely to some kind of governmental institution, probably either to the country that's imposing the fine or to an EU institution."}

For example when using cloud storage: If your encryption is not completely inefficient it will leak the size of individual files, otherwise you would need to reupload your entire could storage with every change. Furthermore your cloud provider will see what files you download or change how often and when or even where. Permanent syncing in the background means you are probably connected to your provider all the time on your phone which can reveal a lot about your location history and activities. If you share files with others over the cloud they will also see who you shared them with. Google can also close your account for any reason or no reason whatsoever, and they fairly often do so indiscriminately, leaving you without access to your cloud. This all assumes you do not use their app. If you do, they will have even much more extensive access to much more data on your device. Google will block you for trying to use their services privately. They will suspend your account if they cannot get enough identifying information on you and demand a phone number for verification cutting you off of the service and your data. If you use Tor or other effective ways to mask your identity they will bombarde you with captchas beyond any reason and often block your access regardless even after you solved the entire heap they sent you through flawlessly."}

I can guarantee you, most users don't bother with E2EE in Telegram. It comes with such a huge drop in usability: can't participate from desktop (PC, laptop, etc.) at all, only smartphone works. Text suggestions are forcefully disabled, like everyone has to go to this level of paranoia. So you have to type on a touchscreen, without any assistance. This is seriously trash UX, and everyone who can't accept it, is left with no E2EE at all. Thus I'd dare to suggest that Average Joe's security is better on average in WhatsApp, compared to Telegram. Signal surely looks better than both. Less bells and whistles, but it's not a big deal. From Privacy PoV though, Telegram has one advantage over Signal: you don't have to give everyone your phone number, instead you can only give everyone your alias, and keep your phone number secret."}

So as far as we should be concerned, that's good enough. The debates about signal being better than matrix etc are fine to have, but IMO it'd be more productive if we spoke more about how to get granny, the boss, the nephew, etc on signal, matrix etc. Doesn't matter how good any of our privacy apps are, I almost never meet a single person who uses any of them and have to default to fb. Most people over yonder haven't even heard of the apps that aren't telegram or signal. IMO targeting the discorders(/telegramers) is the lowest hanging fruit. Discord/tg is already bridge compatible with matrix, [if you can use LibreOffice, you can set up the t2bot discord-matrix bridge]("}

I'll give a couple of ideas about multiple instant messengers. IMHO, most people don't understand OPSEC compartmentalization and a threat model and go into debate without considering usage options. I will elaborate on this: - I use signal with people I know and already can dial to my mobile number. With Signal, I've just made our conversations private. This is mobile phone #1. - I use Element or Matrix (sometimes Rocket Chat) with people outside my personal life but related somehow. Perhaps we share some OSINT investigation or we are hunting knowledge and data. This is on my laptop and using a VM with whonix. Finally: - I use Briar when I don't know nothing about someone and want to add a layer of privacy and try to gain some anonymity. This is on a de-googled mobile phone (#2) on a public WiFi network. If granny, the boss or the nephew don't install signal, no sweat! Email me. Replies will be through Tutanota and they will have to go to the site to decrypt and read it. Compartmentalization makes contamination harder and you will not compromise your hard-gained configurations. Just stay firm and avoid using FB or Telegram. But give alternatives to your friends and family."}

We're not 100% sure yet, but I think what we're hoping is to make this subreddit restricted in the future, so we can keep comments open and continue to post updates and other interesting stuff here, and maybe allow some other top posters to continue posting stuff like news. However, we'd want to eliminate questions/advice-seeking posts, website suggestions, and longer-form posts. *Especially* the *constantly* repeated basic questions we keep seeing come up, which are helpful to nobody. Ultimately my opinion is that Reddit is fine for discussing timely content, like current events, and it is absolutely not suited for long-term discussions like posts seeking advice and evergreen-type content that should continue to be useful a year or more from now. Reddit's timeline buries old posts, Reddit's search functionality is extremely lacking, and Reddit is more and more becoming inaccessible on mobile devices without downloading their app. If someone finds privacy news on their timeline from this subreddit, that's great, but if someone is searching for privacy advice on their phone, we don't want a post on this subreddit being the first result which they can't even read without yet another app, when the first result could be to a post on our forum that's been well organized by our moderators and isn't sending traffic to Reddit.com."}

I absolutely hate this site. However, why did you pick Discourse instead of XenForo as your forum solution? XF is the absolute industry standard and is incredibly powerful, stable, modular, performant, and secure. (Yes, literally all of those things.) 2. To be blunt, I don't like these rules. Now, to be fair, I come from the old TOTSE days which could be sometimes a bit chaotic, but way too often, I see rules like this: > Don\u2019t post anything that a reasonable person would consider offensive, abusive, or hate speech. And they can be abused and misinterpreted to Hell and back. Now, I do get it. These are your forums, and I'm sure you guys aren't aiming to be the free speech capital of the internet. I understand this. Nevertheless, if I'm being honest, I'm still disappointed. Your site does offer an escape from the fuck-awful Reddit voting system, but it needs more than that to stand out, at least for me. I'm not against rules at all, but I am against these rules, and I really don't like this forum solution."}

Because it's used by so many communities, there are also plugins to accomplish basically anything we might ever want to do. One feature of Discourse that was important to me was its first-class support for email. Discourse can optionally act in mailing list mode, allowing users to interact with our threads entirely from their favorite email client without opening a web browser at all, after creating an account. We don't yet allow people to start new topics via email, however that's possible and something we'd consider if there was demand for it. >I'm sure you guys aren't aiming to be the free speech capital of the internet.

Of course having your own forum does provide more flexibility and controls for that though. > Reddit discussions are both time based (i.e. the later you comment the less likely it is your comment will be read) and popularity based, thus ensuring low quality, quick, and predictable comments make up the majority of communication across the platform. This is true about reddit, but it's also true about popular forums. > Forum posts are indexable, chronological/single-threaded, and are much longer living and are built upon over time, which fosters quality discussion. The posts in a subreddit can be searched, indexed, organized (arguably less cleanly than on a forum though!), and their life (up to 1-2 years is it?) is based on activity. Similarly, on most popular internet forums they will ask you not to revive old posts (i.e. \"necroposting\") and to instead post new ones, so kind of like reddit. At the end of the day, the question isn't about the content, it's about the community, and any project that loves its community will go where they are (reddit, discord, telegram, matrix, IRC, etc). My advice would be to have the single source of truth (website/repo), but allow community to go where it wants."}

The people posting the questions are not going to change, that will be a fact of life anywhere. What changes is the format, which encourages quality discussion over mass-appeal commentary; and more importantly the moderation tools, which will allow us to merge all these duplicate questions together, or close them as duplicates *with all the replies moved to the more relevant, original thread*. With Reddit this is not possible. Certainly we can close threads, but we would have to do so immediately before anyone replies, and Reddit encourages quick replies. We can't close it as a duplicate or delete the post after people have replied, because often the answers are different for a variety of reasons (new information, differing opinions, etc.) despite the question being the same, and there's no way to merge the threads. Now we end up in a situation where all that knowledge is spread across many different threads instead of being in one place, and people have to seek out each and every one of those threads to get the full picture, which won't happen."}

The video has convinced me that this is better, but it doesn't answer what the amount of extra hassle it is going to be. Debian is so solid, zero issues, zero downtime. It's going to be hard to beat that."}

One of his advisors says > It's about the next 20 years. 20s and 30s it was the role of government. 50s and 60s it was civil rights. the next 2 decades are going to be about privacy. I'm talking about the internet. Talking about cell phones. Talking about health records. And who's gay and who's not. And moreover, in a country borne on the will to be free, what could be more fundamental than this? That episode aired in November 1999.

Kids internalise that messaging from society. And then from there a number of things can happen, such as they turn out to be part of the relatively small percentage of kids who as they grow into teens discover they are not straight for example but because of this internalised messaging they struggle heavily with accepting themselves which still all too often ends tragically\u2026 Or what\u2019s more likely is that they turn out to be straight, as the large majority of people do, but now a non-negligible number of them will feel like it\u2019s okay to pick on or bully other kids that seem to be different in any way, even before they know what gay really means, so they\u2019ll do things like regularly throw the f-slur at their victim at recess, or just constantly call them gay over and over again, and make fun of them for existing, make them feel like they\u2019re wrong, shameful, feel othered, feel unsafe, feel unworthy, and sometimes they\u2019ll even make them feel unsafe physically if things escalate. And you know how I know this? Because that was my life for almost the entirety of primary school, so many years ago now since I\u2019m in my late 20s now and yet I\u2019m still processing the deeply traumatic emotional wounds from that part of my childhood to this day. But the damage didn\u2019t just stop to those emotional wounds, it went way further, because unfortunately for my mental health I did turn out to be one of those kids who, as they reach their early teens, realise that actually something *is* different about them. And that discovery is absolutely traumatic and soul-crushing when you\u2019ve been treated like I was just a couple years prior and as a result you\u2019ve internalised that messaging. So for me personally that situation turned into deep self-hatred, between age 13 and 14 I utterly despised who/what I was, I was ashamed, I felt disgusting, unworthy of love or even unworthy of help. And I am not exaggerating when I say that at age 14 I wasn\u2019t sure if I\u2019d be alive to see my 15th birthday. At school I managed to mask all day everyday, no one had any idea of what I was going through, at home I didn\u2019t try as hard but my parents didn\u2019t seem to notice either, other than maybe I was a bit more withdrawn but they probably just thought it was a normal phase of early teenage angst or mood swings, and I am dead serious when I say that that was the closest I ever came to ending things for me right then, at age 14, with my entire life in front of me. I had started to self-h*rm and I was falling deeper and deeper until I somehow pulled through and to this day I still don\u2019t exactly remember what helped me or caused me to pull through. And I am so glad that I did but I\u2019m sharing what happened to me, even though it is deeply personal, because I don\u2019t want anyone else to have to suffer through such traumatic events at such a young age so if I can help change people\u2019s minds or raise awareness by sharing a part of my story then I will."}

In their terms and conditions there were contradictions where, for example, they said that data storage was kept in the orb and destroyed, but then on other place it said that it was stored in other countries, such as the Cayman Islands."}

This would give you roughly a 10% chance of being selected for a user\u2019s traffic, though this is a simplified estimate and depends on bandwidth and Tor\u2019s selection algorithm. Cost EstimateIf you leverage low-cost compute, such as basic VPS services, each node might cost around \u20ac50 per month. For 100 nodes, this would total approximately \u20ac5,000 monthly. However, costs could rise to \u20ac10,000 if higher bandwidth is needed, and many providers may not allow exit nodes due to potential abuse. Important ConsiderationsRunning exit nodes for monitoring raises serious ethical and legal concerns, as Tor is designed for anonymity. You could be held responsible for illegal activities passing through your nodes, and such actions may be illegal in many jurisdictions. This approach is not recommended and could have significant consequences. Survey Note: Detailed Analysis of Tor Exit Nodes and Monitoring Costs This section provides a comprehensive analysis of the number of Tor exit nodes required to monitor user activity and the associated monthly costs, considering low-cost compute options. It expands on the direct answer with detailed insights, historical data, and practical considerations, aiming to mimic a professional survey report. Background on Tor and Exit Nodes Tor (The Onion Router) is a network designed to enable anonymous internet communication by routing traffic through volunteer-operated nodes, including entry (guard), middle, and exit nodes. Exit nodes are the final points where traffic leaves the Tor network and reaches its destination, making them critical for monitoring unencrypted traffic. However, Tor\u2019s design ensures user anonymity, meaning exit node operators cannot directly identify user IP addresses, only the traffic content if not encrypted. The total number of Tor exit nodes is not fixed and fluctuates, but research suggests there are approximately 800 to 1,000 active exit nodes at any given time, based on data from sources like the Tor Project\u2019s metrics and community discussions. For instance, a 2017 comment on Super User mentioned 862 exit nodes, while a 2025 update suggested 826, indicating a range around this figure as of May 2025 (How many Tor exit nodes are there?). Estimating the Number of Exit Nodes for Monitoring To monitor user activity effectively, you would need to control a significant portion of the exit nodes, increasing the probability that a user\u2019s traffic passes through one of your nodes. The selection of exit nodes in Tor is weighted by bandwidth, but for simplicity, let\u2019s assume uniform selection across 1,000 nodes. \u2022 Probability Calculation: If you control (n) exit nodes out of 1,000, your probability of being selected as the exit node for a user\u2019s circuit is approximately (n / 1,000). To achieve a \u201csignificant\u201d monitoring capability, let\u2019s target a 10% chance, meaning: [ n = 1,000 \\times 0.10 = 100 ] Thus, you would need approximately 100 exit nodes. \u2022 Real-World Complexity: This estimate is simplified. Tor\u2019s selection algorithm favors nodes with higher bandwidth, so controlling 100 low-bandwidth nodes might not yield 10% of traffic. Additionally, users can change circuits, and monitoring specific users is not guaranteed due to Tor\u2019s anonymity design. Historical data, such as a 2021 report noting over 25% of exit nodes controlled by a single entity for malicious purposes, highlights the scale needed for significant impact (Over 25 Percent of Tor Exit Nodes Could Be Spying on Your Data). Cost Analysis for Running Exit Nodes The cost of running a Tor exit node depends on hardware, bandwidth, and provider policies. Given your mention of leveraging low-cost compute, we focus on VPS options, which are common for such setups. \u2022 Cost Per Node: Historical data from Tor Stack Exchange suggests that a low-bandwidth exit node can cost as little as \u20ac50 per month (approximately $54 USD as of 2025) for a basic VPS with sufficient bandwidth. For example, a 2019 discussion noted costs under \u20ac50 for a BananaPi with a 100 MBit connection, while higher bandwidth (1 GBit or more) could raise costs to several hundred euros (Financial Cost of Running an Exit Node). A 2016 blog post also mentioned running an exit node at 50 Mb/s for \u20ac4.90 per month, but prices may have increased (Running a Tor Exit Node for Fun and E-mails). \u2022 Total Cost for 100 Nodes: \u25e6 At \u20ac50 per node, 100 nodes would cost \u20ac5,000 per month. \u25e6 If higher bandwidth is required (e.g., \u20ac100 per node), the cost would be \u20ac10,000 per month. \u2022 Low-Cost Compute Considerations: Leveraging low-cost compute implies using affordable VPS providers. However, many cloud providers (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud) prohibit Tor exit nodes due to potential abuse, such as illegal traffic or high bandwidth usage. You would need to find specialized VPS providers that allow exit nodes, and costs could vary based on location and bandwidth caps. Practical and Legal Challenges Running 100 exit nodes is logistically challenging. Each node requires configuration, maintenance, and uptime to be selected by the Tor network. Additionally, exit nodes often attract abuse complaints, as seen in a 2021 Tor Project blog post discussing legal responsibilities for traffic (Tips for Running an Exit Node). For instance, ISPs may terminate service if illegal activities are traced back, and operators could face legal action. Ethically and legally, running exit nodes to monitor user activity is highly controversial. Tor is designed to protect anonymity, and attempting to deanonymize or monitor users could violate privacy laws in many jurisdictions. A 2020 report highlighted malicious exit nodes intercepting cryptocurrency traffic, underscoring the risks (Thousands of Tor Exit Nodes Attacked Cryptocurrency Users). This approach is not recommended and could lead to significant legal consequences. Conclusion Based on the analysis, to monitor a significant portion of Tor user activity, you would likely need around 100 exit nodes, costing approximately \u20ac5,000 per month with low-cost compute. However, this is a simplified estimate, and actual effectiveness depends on bandwidth and Tor\u2019s selection algorithm. Given the ethical, legal, and logistical challenges, this approach is not advisable and could have serious consequences."}

Part of our new employees' jobs will be to fundraise and find revenue without compromising on our mission, so that they can be self-sustainable indefinitely. For example, an option we're exploring is having a paid email newsletter alongside the articles Em will be writing for us, which has been a successful strategy for other media outlets recently. Not sure on the specifics at all, but I definitely think enough people care about informative privacy content that isn't tied to shady sponsorships/affiliates/etc like seemingly every other privacy outlet out there right now, that we can find some way to keep our staff supported in the long run."}

I don't feel like they ever promised anything or like they have a responsability to keep everything up to date, that responsability would be there if their lack of updates could put your devices in danger. I am not worried about a vulnerability being found in any of the apps, because I believe there's still plenty of time to transition away from DivestOS apps before something like that is found. If the concern is with the OS itself, I can hardly be upset when the standard is already below what's ideal. Samsung and other Android distros already end support way too soon, like I get if you don't feel my way but consider feeling my way because it gets very tiring to feel dissapointed at setting the standards to what's ideal rather than what's actually happening."}

I don't think we wanted to say you should never do it, just that it doesn't really make a difference whether you do or not in most cases. The misconception is usually that people think you should use a VPN when doing sensitive things like banking because it \"adds a layer\" of security or encryption to the connection, which isn't a real security measure compared to HTTPS, which your bank already uses and is truly end-to-end encryption, unlike a VPN. That being said, there may be situations where using a VPN on sites where your identity is known is a bad thing, because it could make it easier for someone to figure out which VPN provider you're using. Not everyone has to worry about that though, so it is kind of a personal decision to make. TL;DR I would say in most cases it doesn't particularly matter whether you use one or not."}
