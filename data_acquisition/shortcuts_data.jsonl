But when I listen in the bathroom, unfortunately it can leak into his bedroom, which is adcjaent. In the off-chance I\u2019m having a shower concert at a time when he needs more quiet in his bedroom, I made this shortcut. Any time he can text me \u201cvolume down\u201d and it turns my music down to level that doesn\u2019t reverberate the walls. Usually it isn\u2019t an issue because he\u2019s not home. But I consider this a great concession in case our schedules conflict. Our apartments have excellent soundproofing, so turning it down to 70% takes care of any sound leak. High trust with my homie neighbour."}

Yes this is exactly right. And those of us who are programmers could tell you creating logic flows through code seems easier than shortcuts. Shortcuts is line a Frankenstein of slow user interface with completely unclear labels on everything, and cherry on top is basic things aren\u2019t allowed, like setting a tracking Boolean which would be one line typed in 1 second in code, but ends up being a 10 minute process in shortcuts with 3-4 entries all specially configured, just to track a simple yes/no value. Programmers know they\u2019ve made the basic simplest things very difficult thus cutting off shortcut\u2019s potential at the kneecaps. All that said I\u2019m still using it because it is the only option for some things and there is a slight feeling of pride mixed with \u201chow much time did I waste?\u201d At the end. :).

It was meant to \u2026 ahem \u2026 *measure your performance* (in the sheets, natch). It disappeared without a trace, App Store listing, home page, Twitter account too I think. I assume the developer(s?) didn\u2019t really raise a fuss and they just let it fade. Unless it had larger problems not reported to the public, my belief is that the problematic aspect of the app was that it used the microphone for measurement. Massive privacy problem there. Not just the accelerometer, and\u2026 I forget if there was anything else to it. IIRC if you can manage to coerce search terms and find it, there was some tech blog coverage of it, but all links in them to the aforementioned web properties are just gone."}

Sorry for the wall of text. Like I said I want to automate as much as possible and require as little input as possible. So let\u2019s go over this. When I press my action button and my phone is face down. It will ba placed into dnd mode. Pressing the button again takes it out of dnd If my phone is not face down it will check the current focus mode and take action depending on that. If my phone is in personal focus the button will start a browse for me search with arc. If it is in landscape it will open a controller app. In work focus pressing the button acts as play/pause, unless the phone is in portrait, in that case it will open a menu to choose to play music or an audiobook In sleep focus pressing the button while in landscape (when my phone is on its dock) will toggle my bedside lamp. Otherwise it will turn on my flashlight. Finally in driving focus if I am at home between certain hours it will start navigation to work. But outside of those hours it opens my garage. If I\u2019m not home it starts navigation home. Hope this helps, I\u2019m working on a shareable version so I\u2019ll post that when it\u2019s ready!"}

I'm sure this works great now, I hope it continues to work well into the future for ya! Personally, I'm just here to state that I really wish Apple would incorporate # of taps/length of taps to make buttons capable of more than a single action. For simplicity, it could be standardized to just 1 normal tap vs. 2 rapidfire taps. But I'd prefer 1 long vs. 2 normal vs. 3 rapid taps. 3 actions in 1 button. 12 actions in the 4 buttons we've got. And you'd still be able to have the volume + power = screenshot. Of course 12 is overwhelming and I'd screw up the tap speed which'd piss me off and opt for 2/button rather than 3/button. ...or heck, why not just the action button? It feels so useless with just 1 thing attached to it. But now I'm curious, maybe with shortcuts you can do everything I just mentioned. ...is it ironic that I started off this comment by pointing out the convoluted nature of the OP shortcut?

That eliminates the redundant \u201cGet Focus\u201d actions as well as the need to copy the focus name to the clipboard when it can be read directly. It also makes it easier to follow for others as there was no need for nested IF statements for what this is doing, even before they added multi-conditional IF actions for iOS 18. \u201cStop this Shortcut\u201d prevents it from going on to check other focuses that are just going to return false anyway, if you have multiple possibilities for [Current Focus].

Including his teenage daughters who would occasionally help out. That thing was so infected with porn malware, that random shit would pop up or browsers would redirect. His brother, the other owner told him to stop and wiped the hard drive twice and was getting fed up with it. Especially his constant denials. So my friend had a plan. They created a fake \u201cerror\u201d message with their ISP\u2019s logo and a detail message about how their illegal porn usage has caused the isp to suspend their account for two weeks. They saved the image on the C drive and made it the home page for the browser. At around 7am the next morning, the owner is calling his brother, frantic that he just shut down the company\u2019s access to the internet. Apparently late the night before, he had been calling his son to fix it. Who had no idea what he was talking about. Then he called the ISP himself and tried to explain this error and the poor tech guy hadn\u2019t \u00e0 fucking clue what was going on. So he eventually had to come clean to his brother. It went brilliantly."}

Thanks to this sub I\u2019ve been learning more about Shortcuts and tinkering over the past month or so, and I finally have a set up that I think is worth sharing. Here\u2019s a breakdown of how this works at a high level: * When I press the Action Button, the Shortcut will run and wait for 1 second. * If I press the increase volume button, it opens my authenticator app. * If I press the decrease volume button, it opens a menu with apps that I can open. * If I do nothing, it toggles Silent Mode (i.e. the default Action Button behavior). * If I do nothing AND I\u2019m driving, it opens a menu with destinations that I can map to using Google Maps. I think the logic should be reasonably easy to follow from the screenshots, but one nuance is around the volume. I\u2019m creating a variable called \u201cInitial Volume\u201d that stores the volume when I first trigger the Shortcut, then setting the volume to 50% and storing that in a different variable called \u201cVolume\u201d. When I check to see if the volume increases or decreases, I check it against \u201cVolume\u201d. Why? Because if you already have the volume set to the lowest value when you trigger the Shortcut, you can\u2019t decrease the volume more which prevents the App Launcher from running. Once everything\u2019s done, I set my volume back to the \u201cInitial Volume\u201d value. This was cobbled together using a lot of ideas from this sub so thanks to the people that inspired it! The setup may look complex but it\u2019s surprisingly super intuitive to use. ~~EDIT:~~ [~~Download here.~~]( EDIT 2: ***See my reply to this comment for detailed instructions on adding this to your phone.*** EDIT 3: Thanks to a rec in another thread for Menu Box, my lists are now a little prettier!"}

One suggestion from my testing - the \u201cCurrent Volume\u201d it\u2019s receiving is the media volume. This means that when you run the shortcut, it sets your ringtone volume to whatever your media volume was prior to running the shortcut since that\u2019s what\u2019s stored in the variable. I was able to get around this by using the Media volume rather than the Ringtone, and I have it set the Media volume automatically to 1%. That way it can still register the down press to 0% and isn\u2019t blaring your media volume to 50% for a second before registering what you\u2019re doing. The only downside is if you are playing something while using the shortcut you\u2019ll get a short second of silence while it processes, but I think that\u2019s a perfectly fine trade off for this."}

It\u2019s me, that guy! Not at all offended by your comment on the design of my shortcut lol. I do agree that upfront, the design of my shortcuts using the combination of orientation + focus modes looks messy. But I believe it\u2019s actually much more intuitive once you understand what\u2019s actually going on. I didn\u2019t do my shortcut justice by ONLY explaining the combinatory logic that constructed it. So now, I really do want to explain it further after having used it for almost an entire year with complete satisfaction: The end goal/purpose of my shortcut was to feel \u201cnatural\u201d by executing one \u201caction\u201d at all times, that action being most relevant and easy to remember in the given situation. Another goal was that I wouldn\u2019t have to interact with the screen of my phone, such as selecting something from a menu which is all too common with a lot of these action button shortcuts. Few things to explain so this makes sense: First off, before I even created that shortcut, my phone had already been set up to revolve around my lifestyle. That being, a \u201cpersonal mode\u201d that only automatically activates when I\u2019m home. A \u201cwork mode\u201d only when at work, a \u201csleep mode\u201d only at night\u2026 etc. The shortcut I created leverages these focus modes. For example, if I\u2019m at home, I always need access to my Roku app the most since my kids long broke the physical remote. So no matter what, I press that shortcut and I get direct access to my Roku Remote. At night, the most useful thing I needed at that moment when all my family was asleep was a very dulled down flashlight, which I found myself using frequently throughout the years. That\u2019s what the action button does during sleep mode. It activates a very dull flashlight. No more examples. The point I want to make with this paragraph is that: this shortcut will have the action button always execute the most \u201cuseful\u201d thing that my situation/focus modes necessitates with one press. No menu required. Now that alone, wouldn\u2019t be a lot of functionality. I\u2019d be limited to one useful thing per focus mode. I had other things that I wanted my action button to do. I still wanted it to act as a silencer, for example, among some other actions. This is where the orientation stuff comes into play. It paved the way for more functionality, without taking away from what I built already previously with the focus modes, and in a natural, easy-to-remember way. It\u2019s very straightforward, and you\u2019ll see it too. - Just how the iPhone silences a phone call or alarm if you put it face down, my shortcut mimicked that behavior. If I put my phone face down and hold the action button, it will put it into silence mode (I also added that it would bring the volume slider all the way down). Super handy for meetings, attending a funeral, etc. - Now I don\u2019t know you, but I guess most people just watch videos in landscape with the FaceID module to the left and the charging port on the right. Am I correct in this? Either way, my phone lives with the orientation lock on. I do have automations set in place to make the Photos app and YouTube the exception, where the orientation will unlock when those apps are open, and only when they are open. However, every once in a while, I\u2019ll want to watch a video in the X app, or have a family member send me a video in WhatsApp or iMessage that is a landscape video. In those instances, all I have to do is hold the phone as I normally do when I watch a video, and hold the action button. It\u2019ll unlock the orientation right there and then. - This next one is funny because I never would\u2019ve guessed back then that Apple was going to add a dedicated camera button, but that\u2019s what the action button does if I hold it in landscape where my right index finger would naturally press a shutter button. I\u2019ll use that finger to hold the action button like a real camera, and the camera app will always open. I think this design is much more intuitive and user-friendly. Everything is laid out in a way that feels natural to the action or situation, and there\u2019s no need for any extra steps or interactions. All you have to do is press the action button and hold your phone like you normally would. If you still think this isn\u2019t the best approach, I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts. I\u2019m open to any feedback you may have."}

If it\u2019s an email, block the message and mark it as SPAM or PHISHING. Never reply or click on any \u201cUnsubscribe\u201d link as this will only confirm your email address is in use. Phone calls should be redirected to either an invalid number or simply declined as that will make the spammer/bot mark the number as invalid.

I did mess around with it a little bit and here's exactly what happens (I'm providing details because I don't really know what most of it means.) First I cloned it from Github and tried to make a MAKEPKG file (I use Arch btw) but I realized that would take way too long. Then I tried running `npm start` in the cloned directory, and I ran into an issue saying that the package `electron-updater` was missing. Then I installed that using `npm install electron-updater` and the same thing happened for `electron-log` and `electron-store`, and I did the same for those. Afterwards, I got an error that said something along the lines of `TypeError: Uncaught Exception something something...`. I noticed that some of the slashes in the file paths in the error message were backwards, so I went through all the files and replaced all the `\\\\`s with `/`s. Then I ran into the what appears to be the same error just with the slashes flipped. Here's exactly what it says: > A JavaScript error occurred in the main process > Uncaught Exception: > TypeError: Error processing argument at index 0, conversion failure from /home/{my username}/Desktop/airwave/res/icon.ico > at createTray (/home/{my username}/Desktop/airwave/main.js:196:12) > at App.<anonymous> (/home/{my username}/Desktop/airwave/main.js:94:9) > at App.emit (events.js:208:15) So yeah it didn't work, though I don't know if that's just because I don't know how to install/run Electron apps that aren't already packaged for me. Hopefully this helps you if you decide to bring it to Linux though."}

Now before you jump all over me, screaming about how it\u2019s not even close and it\u2019s kindergarten programming; know that I\u2019m well aware of this. But I\u2019m willing to bet that there are a lot of people in my position who are finding these shortcuts maybe not super useful, but certainly intriguing. So while the majority of shortcuts may not be useful, if they pique someone\u2019s interest, and make them think, and learn, and possibly find an interest in something that they found the bar for entry too high before; then I think they\u2019re all great. So I hope people keep cranking them out, regardless of their usefulness. Because someone out there may have the greatest idea for one, that we\u2019d all find useful. And if poking around inside of a silly shortcut helps them understand it better and put them on the path of creating the next great shortcut, then I think that\u2019s amazing too."}

See thats when automation actually solves an actual problem... And in the winter because i live more north, i often wake up in the morning in the dark... and thats depressing and messes with your circadian rhythms... so having your lights go on gradually as you wake up helps to simulate morning light to make it easier to wake up. So theres a few things that can improve comfort. Its not necessarily quality of life that is improved because these things are superfluous... no one *needs* to have automated lights... they\u2019re just comforts..."}

But here\u2019s a really basic example, and I can provide more if you need I have a shortcut for turning off my heat pump if it\u2019s on and on if it\u2019s off. Annoyingly the IFTTT applet that controls the heat pump can only send on or off commands, not a toggle command, so I have the shortcut first check an iCloud document for the status of the heat pump, then issue the relevant command to IFTTT, then update the document to the new status. The iCloud checking and updating slows the shortcut down somewhat It\u2019s faster to open the heat pump app, select the heat pump and toggle the heat pump on or off. But that\u2019s 3 taps in different places on the screen I have to concentrate for longer than I would if I just ran the shortcut from the homescreen. It takes longer to complete, but I don\u2019t actually have to do anything after I tell the shortcut to run. So takes slightly longer, but it\u2019s easier."}

Not all women would appreciate it, but it's essentially that thing where someone just sends \"poke\" when they're thinking of you, but with the addition of having put in the time to write a script, specifically for the purpose. For many women, just that texted \"poke, I love you\" is all it takes to make her feel nice. It takes surprisingly little to foster connection. It takes a certain nerdery to appreciate, but either way, it takes a conscious thought about her, and a physical action to let her know. Think of it this way: if a quadriplegic dude set this up so it's easier to tell his wife he loves her while he's out in the world, it'd be super romantic. This guy may have full use of his hands, so he's just saving time, but it's still a sweet gesture."}

Those messages are from a computer program that was written and designed and the messages were written and designed by the person you love.

This should work with any Plex client (streaming box, tablet, phone), all you have to do is fill in the dictionary with your server and client info. The trickiest part was getting it to resume playback vs. starting from the beginning each time. This involved getting the current playhead timestamp from the server then passing it as an offset to the client. My next project will be applying this to TV shows, which will be trickier since I'll have to determine the latest unplayed episode from the server."}

The way I use it is I have all my pirated movies on a hard drive connected to my spare computer which I leave on and running in another room. Plex media server is installed on this pc. Plex then scans the hard drive and finds matches to movies. It uses the match to add the movie poster, plot summary, cast etc. And gives you an interface that you can browse through and sort the media (eg. By release year). I then have plex installed on all my decked so I can watch this media on any tv or mobile device in my house. It also remembers play information so you can watch half a movie in one room, pause, and continue from the same place in another. Similar to a service such as Netflix handles it. In short it\u2019s your own personal streaming service but you need to provide a link to the content."}

Getting very frustrated with how something this simple just doesn't seem to work."}

Some of them are self-explanatory, but a few are personalized so they might not make sense to you. I\u2019ll try to explain. It\u2019ll take forever to share each one so let me know if you find one interesting and I\u2019ll share later tonight before I sleep. From left to right **Music:** - Say you shuffle your music, you land on a song you love and you want to play the whole album. This will do it. [LINK]( - Shuffle a playlist of favorite songs (~3000) [LINK]( - Sometimes I listen to an album of an artist I just discovered, so I like it and I want to know where to go next. This will take you to an aggregator that ranks the artist\u2019s top albums. [LINK]( - Tweet a song you\u2019re listening to with an album artwork and a YouTube link of your choice (it\u2019ll take you to YT app and you copy a link then it\u2019ll take you back). [LINK]( - Shuffle all songs [LINK]( - Shuffle albums (you play a random album in full then move to the next random album). [LINK]( - Play one song of your choice and then shuffle all songs. [LINK]( - Get artwork of your current song [LINK]( - Add current album to your favorite playlist (same playlist mentioned above) [LINK]( - Similar to the one above except here it asks you for input which should be an artist name [LINK]( - Search lyrics of current song [~~LINK~~]( [Better shortcut]( **Keyboard shortcuts**: - Presents some codes (\u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af etc) [LINK]( - Lets you type a setup and a punchline then copies the text to your clipboard [LINK]( - Type an emoji and it\u2019ll name it [LINK]( - Get a wall of text from your clipboard, find a word and replace with another. [LINK]( **Camera roll:** - Create a grid from camera roll [LINK]( - Combine Screenshots [LINK]( - Upload to imgur and copy link to clipboard [LINK]( - Save video from Safari [LINK]( - Convert video to GIF [LINK]( - Select multiple screenshots and delete them [LINK]( **Web**: - Open a Reddit link in Apollo [LINK]( - Same for Tweetbot [LINK]( - Download YouTube [~~LINK~~]( [Update]( - Download videos from major social networks [~~LINK~~]( [Updated shortcut]( - Download a file [LINK]( - Shorten URL [LINK]( - Want to read a NY times or WashPost article and get hit with a paywall? This will take you to an add free webpage of the whole article [LINK]( - Show a graph of an Amazon product from CamelCamelCamel [LINK]( **Utilities**: - Kidnapped and want to ask for help but don\u2019t know SOS? Well, this can save you by sending the signal using flashlight [LINK]( - Flip a coin [LINK]( - Control center DND has improved but not dramatically. Sometimes you want to turn it on and disable at a certain time. This allows you to do that. [LINK]( **Random**: - Calculate how many days between two dates [LINK]( - Calculate Tip [LINK]( - Speak body of article [LINK]( Edit: Just updated my comment with links. And yes, I used a [shortcut]( to automate part of the process:)"}

What I mean to say is if you just need to have an exact match for **\"****reddit****\"** then you can just type in **\"reddit\"** as is. &#x200B; Longer Answer: But to answer the question of what they mean in the screenshots, I can try and introduce some basics. Please note that I am no master at using RegEx. &#x200B; The 1st screenshot's *Pattern:* ***(( I'll try to break them down one by one: ** \\-- looks for the characters that matches or the (or) here was implemented thru the use of the question mark (?). So the expression ** looks for either http or **:\\\\/\\\\/** \\-- after the text \"** or \"** was matched, it will now check if it is also followed by a colon sign \"**:**\" and 2 forward slashes \"**/**\". Most of the time, forward slashes are considered as \"special characters\". These \"special characters\" needs an escape character (denoted by a backslash \"**\\\\**\") before you can use them in their literal sense. So if you want to look for 2 normal slashes in the text pattern, you need to add a backslash before the normal slashes. Hence, the pattern \"**\\\\/\\\\/**\". (Colon is not a special character so it does not need to have its own backslash) Some more of the special characters that needs to be escaped: `. \\ + * ? [ ^ ] $ ( ) { } = ! < > | : -` **(?:www\\\\.|(?!www))** \\-- This one has an operand OR inside the parenthesis. It is this guy **|**. Also there is a \"function\" being used here, the \"**?:\"** and also \"**?!\". \"?:\"** is just for grouping purposes. It's for another topic to discuss. While the \"**?!\"** means to not match. So this expression, if added after the ** means that it will match anything that has \"** or followed by a \"**www\\\\.**\" (dot is escaped here) or anything that has \"** or and then not followed by \"**www**\". So for example, using this code will match the following: >` > >` > >` > >` > >` > >` &#x200B; &#x200B; The 2nd screenshot's *Find Text:* ***.+?(?=reddit\\\\.com)*** **.+?** \\-- If you noticed the dot \"**.**\" is not escaped here. When you do not escape special characters, it will default to its primary purpose. In this case it means \"**any character**\". The plus sign \"**+**\" means 1 or more. The question mark sign \"**?**\" means 0 or 1. So if you put these 3 together, they mean to match **any character (.)** that has **1 or more any character (+)** and would stop at the first sign of the next match (?). See differences between \".+\" and \".+?\" [here]( **(?=reddit\\\\.com)** \\-- This one uses the **?=** \"function\" or the **positive look ahead.** What this means is that it looks for the word **\"****reddit.com****\"** but does not match it or show it as a result. so ***.+?(?=reddit\\\\.com)*** is looking for any characters or word before the **\"reddit.com\"**"}

Donations welcome to $Sonikkua on CashApp! Or donate to a worthy cause of your choosing, even better!* **EDIT:** Amazon knows a good idea when they see one, I\u2019ve been Sherlocked! Just open the following URL in Safari once you have Shortcuts installed: This shortcut may be useful when getting pulled over by the police. It pauses any music that may be playing, turns down your brightness and volume, turns on Do Not Disturb, and sends a message to the contact of your choosing letting them know you\u2019re being pulled over and what your current location is. It then opens your front camera and starts a video recording so you have a video record of being pulled over. Once you stop the recording it sends a copy of the video to a contact you specify, puts volume and brightness back to where they were, turns off Do Not Disturb, and gives you the option to send to iCloud Drive or Dropbox! Works best when used with a phone dash mounted, but that\u2019s just my opinion. **EDIT:** Automatic start of video recording is now here! Just make sure you\u2019re running Shortcuts 2.1 or newer! **ANOTHER EDIT, BECAUSE 3732469 HAVE HAD A PROBLEM:** Make sure you are opening the link in the full Safari web browser on iOS 12 with the Shortcuts app installed. Not Chrome, not your Reddit clients built in browser, not anywhere else. If you are getting an error about invalid links or being redirected to the Shortcuts gallery, this is why. Once the Shortcut in installed set it to run via Siri: **EDIT:** I made the news :-) FAQ: **Can I run this from the lockscreen? With the phone screen off?** Nope, Shortcuts limitations. **What about an Android version?** Nope, not from me anyway. **How do I stop the recording?** Press volume up, or tap the stop recording button on screen. **Can I automatically send the video?** No, after you have finished the recording you do manually have to hit send. **Can I interview you for NEWSPLACE???** Nah, done with all that now. I\u2019m an introvert and not much accustomed to all this attention."}

Can't believe Apple doesn't give you the option to just get in without swiping like other phones with face recognition do. Maybe this could be a new option in major updates to come??? For the time being though, this NFC trick coupled with that springboard shortcut works pretty much flawlessly. Just be sure to disable shortcuts notifications (by going to screen time->see all activity->notifications->shortcuts and then change the allow notifications toggle to off) or else you'll get a lot of notifications from Shortcuts from this, which could get quite annoying especially if you make use of a Qi charger or are in any other situation when you're not directly looking at your phone to unlock it."}

I'm rebuilding my shortcut to make it work on every iphone (screen sizes are the biggest hassle) but as I work with several overlayed PNG images, the biggest problem is the sunset/sunrise visual. The wallpaper is taken from the stock wallapers of the Microsoft Surface Pro and is not my property. I'll keep you guys updated!

He creates different layers by encoding text into png images so I just went the same way. But the results are not satisfying when e.g. putting a png rain layer over a blue sky landscape. It doesn\u2019t feel realistic so now I\u2019m indeed rebuilding all the different images in photoshop (this is what I showed here)."}

I\u2019m with another commenter, I wasn\u2019t interested in \u2018Workflow\u2019. It felt like jargon. Workflows, to me, refer to how I do repetitive tasks, like what I do when I get to work every day, how I mark my students\u2019 work, how I make an appointment with the boss, etc. That didn\u2019t translate to what I thought an automation script did, and even when I checked the app, most of the built-in workflows were next to useless.

I prefer the term \u2018Automator\u2019 because it\u2019s more descriptive, but it also sounds a bit opaque. \u2018Shortcuts\u2019, on the other hand, tells me what I can expect to get out of the app, why I\u2019d use it, and what it can offer me in a real sense."}

I\u2019ve had a few touchscreen laptops here and there and I usually just forgot it even had a touchscreen. If that is the case, it seems like a waste of R+D, materials, weight, expense, etc. just get an iPad. A lot of valid arguments against what I\u2019ve just said, but that\u2019s just my hot take. You\u2019re sorta right, but also I was fixating on Ui rather than function. I understand why a more user-friendly version of Automator has its place on MacOS for people who aren\u2019t power users to become more adept at using their computers to their fullest potential (or at least moreso than before). I suppose there\u2019s no harm in having the option of using shortcuts or Automator, but I know this would never happen because it\u2019s just not something Apple would do anyway. Unlike Microsoft, Apple doesn\u2019t like having bloatware and random extra redundant apps preloaded. It\u2019s a hard sell. Hopefully they\u2019ll just update Automator and make it more user friendly while retaining the ability for more advanced users to code with it."}

I\u2019m not suggesting every Mac have a touchscreen. But Apple is a creative focused company and it seems odd to me that companies like Microsoft are beating them to things like the form factor of a touch screen iMac. Touch, Apple Pencil, etc. are things Apple excel at. While some view adding touch to the Mac as a step towards iOSification, I view it as Apple not bringing important features to macOS. While I share the iOSification fears of others, to a point. I don\u2019t like the rigidity that often comes with that. Personally I don\u2019t think Apple kills Automator once Shortcuts shows up. Though I do think that possibility exists after a couple of iterations when more Automator functionality is ported over. Automation on the Mac should be more user-friendly (while keeping power user features) that is never going to happen with Automator (in terms of updating it), so I\u2019d like to see Shortcuts sooner than later. I also think it\u2019s a bit shortsighted to think Shortcuts can\u2019t eventually replace Automator, in most of not all of its capabilities. If you told someone a few years ago what can be done now on the locked down iOS because of Shortcuts and related apps, they\u2019d think you were high. Things change. Apple doesn\u2019t just view Shortcuts as a toy, I don\u2019t think it would be any different on macOS."}

Furthermore, I think it\u2019s almost worthless without Apple Pencil support. I think the creatives who know and love Apple\u2019s products are probably more than happy using an iPad for their physical work and linking it to a Mac, whether that be with SideCar or just using airdrop/iCloud file integration. The iMac is a different story, because we\u2019re talking about a much larger canvas. The 13\u201d iPad seems pretty darn good to cover the bases of a touchscreen MacBook. Maybe they\u2019d consider a 15\u201d iPad but I doubt it would be strong enough to be thin and light & not have serious structural bending issues anyway."}

They can't turn off wifi. They can't really do much at all. The phone's position will still respond until they turn it off and possibly reboot into DFU but they won't be able to reactivate it so it's worthless. Now, if your phone is unlocked, then they can do just about anything (except for the few things that require a password or pin) and it's a race to lock it before they can disable all network access. (After all, if network access is disabled all these automations will never trigger and, even if they did, the phone could never actually send the images or the audio, even if it captured some. ) I expect that for an experienced thief, that window will be very very small. To that end, I like the focus idea, and I think you need to ensure \"Lock the Screen\" is always the first action, unlike some of the other fancier shortcuts on here (OP had it first, though). Once the phone is locked, we're back in the first scenario again where not much can be done and the phone is worthless to the thief. Is there a case that I'm missing?"}

Apple does not allow 3rd party developers to add customizable actions to shortcuts. The only actions that can be added are actions that have been previously performed and those actions must be EXACTLY the same as what was done in the app. So let\u2019s say you\u2019re listening to a song on Spotify that you like and you add it to a playlist. Now you want to create a shortcut to do that at anytime. Well.... here\u2019s the thing. When you go to shortcuts, you\u2019re not going to see an \u201cadd current song to a playlist\u201d. Instead you would see \u201cAdd \u2018Song X by Artist Y\u2019 to playlist ABC\u201d. So unless you need to add the same song to the same playlist repeatedly, it won\u2019t be very useful. If you want to get a specific Spotify playlist to play when you leave the house, this can already be done, but you\u2019d have to manually tap on the shortcut (or a reminder notice) and Spotify cannot change this.

Look at all homepod reviews - unless you have apple music that thing is pretty much useless in terms of music. This is the same thing all over again as not being able to set default browser, email client etc. So Apple is actively preventing Spotify from building a good version of the features you want.

I used to jail break my original iPhone, iPhone 3GS, and iphone 4. But eventually all the things that were important to me to get things done (3rd party keyboards, and tethering) were added to iOS and jailbreaks didn\u2019t offer me enough to justify the security risk and inevitable instability. Even macs since the original have clearly shown less ability to be customized than previous apple products. This is clearly a choice made to increase usability for more people. We may be interested in hacking our devices to customize them, but most people are not. And the iPhone works for most people without confusing them with unnecessary options (and that\u2019s not even as true as it used to be, iOS 14 has more settings than ever and it can be overwhelming to ordinary people). Face it, we\u2019re in the small minority and it\u2019s not in the best interest of the large majority to dedicate resources to accommodate us all the time.

Lol. But I definitely agree with many points, however, I don\u2019t believe they much care for the user anymore. Customisation doesn\u2019t have to be something users are forced to but we should be able to. Why do I want a PC in my pocket that can\u2019t do 90% of what a PC can do. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m still in the minority, but at a starting price of 1k USD I should be able to do more. I can get a PinePhone for 150 USD that actually lives to the PC in your pocket ideology that smartphones are meant to live by. Security isn\u2019t an issue because you can easily make a kill switch that users who know what they are doing can disable and employ their own security measures. If you know enough you can jailbreak and actually be more secure than you ever could with Apple\u2019s limitations. But they really should lock that feature down to at least people with a free developer amount since the normal day to day users will not be able to do that. But I agree that for most users stock iOS is \u201cgood enough\u201d. Just frustrating you pay asinine prices for hardware and software that isn\u2019t worth it for them to blatantly do whatever they can just to make a quick buck."}

If battery goes above 50%, set wallpaper to _____.\u201d I did this for every 5% increment, so I had to make 40 automations."}

Bottom of post has possible downsides to this method. As those without dynamic island know, which I think are pretty much only 16e users if you have the action button, the banner that shows when running a shortcut via action button is annoying (and with no available workaround to hide it, as far as I know). I\u2019m not sure how it looks for those with the dynamic island, but I assume this guide is still applicable to your phone, it just might not make as big a difference. There is a way to effectively get rid of it though, it will be replaced with a much smaller, less obtrusive banner as shown in the images. The way I did this is by setting up a focus mode which I called \"Action Button\" and then created an automation for that specific focus mode's activation which will run the shortcut. Then, I just put a \"Set focus mode to off\" action at the end of my shortcut to disable it. The only banner you see now is the focus mode being activated and deactivated. A couple caveats, though: If you often use focus modes for other things, this will disable them in order to activate the one you made specifically for this. Banner lasts a little longer than the \"running\" and \"completed\" banner (it's just significantly smaller). If you know how to minimize either of these, especially possibly hiding the banner for the focus mode which I assume is easier than hiding the one for the shortcut running/completing, please tell me :) Awaiting mod approval"}

Currently I have a boundary set up at my home airport, and when I cross outside of that it is supposed to trigger the shortcut. This is my first issue, since it only seems to notify me that a shortcut wants to run. I used a \u201cspeedometer\u201d shortcut I found online to measure speed and I set it up so if it\u2019s over 120 mph it\u2019s supposed to put my phone in airplane mode. This is my second issue since it displays the calculated speed, but I have to click \u201cok\u201d for it to take the next step to put my phone in airplane mode. If it\u2019s under 120 I have it set to open Waze so I can navigate home since I\u2019m likely driving."}

Like do you connect to a WiFi network at the various airports or you just go by with roaming?

Aim for 1-3 sentences unless a detailed explanation is specifically asked for. 4. **Clarify Ambiguity:** If the request is unclear, ask for more details before proceeding. Never guess. 5. **Honesty and Accuracy:** Never invent information, URLs, or data. If you cannot answer or the data is unavailable, state that clearly. 6. **Handle Missing Data:** If a context field is empty, \"null,\" or \"N/A,\" it means that information is not available. Do not mention it or refer to its absence. 7. **Tone:** Maintain a friendly, helpful, and slightly informal tone. 8. **Language:** Always speak English no matter the language in the [Live Context Data] except when asked to craft a reply, which has to be crafted in the language of the conversation for which it is crafted. [Processing Flow] 1. Ask the user what he needs help with 2. Receive and analyze YOUR_NAME's query 3. Scan the [Live Context Data] to find relevant information. 4. Formulate a direct answer. If the query is conversational, chat in a friendly manner. If it is a task, be direct and helpful. --- [Live Context Data] - User input: (Ask for Input} - Screenshot: {Screenshot} - Device Orientation: {Get Orientation} - Active Timers: {Get Current Timer} - App on Screen: {Current App} - Physical Activity: {Get Physical Activity} - Battery: {Battery State}% ({Battery State}) - Location: {Current Location} - Weather: {Weather Conditions} - Current Focus Mode: {Current Focus} - Upcoming Events: {Events} - Upcoming Reminders: {Reminders} - URLs on Screen: {URLs} - Our past conversations: {Text}"}

I have the automation set to run when any alarm goes off, since in theory if the alarm is going off, you\u2019re ready to be disturbed. You could make a shortcut that moves your \u201cshift nap\u201d alarm to the time you want and enables dnd. Then make an automation that disables dnd when that alarm goes off.

My guess is if you send via your carrier\u2019s SMS/MMS, it\u2019s possible that this data is stripped to lower the file size (as well as compressing the image). You\u2019ll notice this if you send photos via text to Android users vs iPhone for example, images won\u2019t look as good being received on the Android phone (until Apple finally rolls out RCS chats I guess\u2026) In your photos app, you normally have to swipe upwards to see the location data by the way. So if it\u2019s not there, then you\u2019ve not received the photo with the location data. I realise now that this automation would be best practice as it covers the user regardless of the receipient\u2019s device being an Apple or Android device & having too much info is better than too little info Edit: person sending the photo also needs to have location permission for their camera app, most people leave this on but not always the way"}

Then you use Regular expressions to search for the day of the week. That will give you all the times for Monday for example, and then do Reg Ex search on the Monday results searching for the current time. RegEx will then return a line with all the data. Sounds like a lot of work, right? Yeah - because it is. And add in a few hours to learn about regular expressions. And you will need to suck just the day name out of the current date and also massage the time you get from \u2018current date\u2019 into the same format as the time in your text file. Sometimes using a shortcut is a big timesaver but sometimes the amount of work that goes into it is way more than the trivial amount of time it saves. In this case, the time it takes you to look at a photo of your schedule on the phone and see the period is very short. Wanna use shortcuts? Maybe store a photo of your schedule in notes, use shortcuts to automatically open that note when you tap the back of your phone 3 times. Much simpler to program, very simple to implement."}

The way text replacement works is by reading the characters from the last Text Boundary, in your case this is space so if you had aaa to be replaced with ?

The boundary is replaced but is not part of the replacement string so what you need is to replace spaceaaa but space cannot be included. Fortunately there are other boundaries you can use. As an example, if your replacement trigger was ;aaa and you typed Test;aaa you would get Test? Which is what you want. The following is a list of boundary characters. I hope this helps.

And removing the phone from the charger half an hour earlier doesn't. Specially because when the battery is full and your phone is still plugged in, your phone is secretly already discharging and recharging the battery to prevent it from sitting at 100%. > I'm only at 165 cycles but my battery life's already down to 98% That's normal. Your battery is perfectly fine. And the number the iphone shows is a faked guess. It's a guess because phones can't really be precise on detecting battery life. But also because batteries never have the nominal charging capacity. A 2000mAH battery could come from the factory having a capacity of 1947mAh, or 2068mAh, or whatever. And the phone can't actually detect the current capacity, only guess it. To be honest, babysitting your batter makes almost no difference. You could maaaaaybe squeeze 1% more battery life **per year** (if you're lucky) if you babysit it every single day. The chips inside the phone and the battery are already doing A LOT to preserve the battery. They're doing much more than you can. So someone with your usage patterns that does not babysit the battery might be at 87% after two years, and you babysitting it might be at 88% or maaaaybe 89% after two years. The difference is almost imperceptible."}

I've already tried hashing this out with ChatGPT to no avail. All I want is to have certain emails to automatically give me a special notification on my phone, like a text message. I used to be able to do this easily when AT&T had an email attached to every phone number, but they recently removed that feature. I tried setting it up to simply send me an imessage when I receive any email in my icloud account, and it just won't work for some reason. Would love an outline. Thank you in advance."}

It\u2019s definitely a visual bug. File is there, even if you can\u2019t see it/the variable. The *real* problem was that I didn\u2019t know what to put as the key for the value with the file. Turns out, the key was literally \u201cfile\u201d. The API didn\u2019t specify that explicitly, I had to look at the test code and it still wasn\u2019t exactly clear. Maybe because the API assumes you already know to put the key as \u201cfile\u201d? Or the API instructions suck. Either way I got it to work. Thank you for offering your insight and confirming the visual bug."}
