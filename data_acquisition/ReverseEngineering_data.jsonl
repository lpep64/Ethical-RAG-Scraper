I would say C++ here, a runtime and some libraries, you can download a free version of Visual Studio(not VS Code) on Windows which will give you all of these. You'd need some experience with (de)serialization formats, specifically JSON in this case. You could write a parser for JSON to get some real experience, it's easy once you are familiar enough with your programming environment. Note: its easy to make it correct, making it perform well is trickier(as demonstrated by the article). When you have the basics of this environment down you'd need some experience with performance concepts and tools, learn to use a debugger, a profiler and most importantly l, learn to get the right information from these tools. Then you'd need some reverse engineering experience, conceptual as in what kind of tools/techniques apply for what I'm trying to do and practical: how can i figure out what this part of a program i don't have any source code for does. Hint: in a case like this you could figure out its something to do with json parsing by seeing the work is CPU-bound(so high cpu but not much memory/disk/network traffic) and noticing a file containing json data is being loaded and unloaded just before and after the cpu-bound work. Disassembly and decompilation-tools will help you identify the signatures of string-related functions(which is what parsing json mainly is)."}

But of course, it's important to note that the margin of error for this estimate is likely very wide, as Denuvo's overhead can vary significantly between different games, and the user's hardware. If someone chooses to conduct an in-depth and valid comparison, it should be done across a substantial number of games (Devuno vs Devnuvoless versions)."}

I have reversed a couple of handlers but nothing exciting yet. One does an equivalent of an xchg instruction, another does some housekeeping in the VM's stack structure as the dispatcher is pretty direct. Then some are a longer, full of code that does nothing and a couple of functions that change virtual state and are add, etc, instructions. Fair amount of instructions that do nothing besides setting something to 0 or all Fs. Lots of use of words and double words none from memory of quadwords. They might get moved around but then operations are on 32 and 16 bit registers. The VIP walks a table of bytecode a word at a time, nothing too unusual, this is used in an algorithm to resolve the address of the next handler. When they're done they jump back to the dispatcher having incremented the pointer to the VIP for the next dispatcher run. I haven't looked at the game functions wrapped in it and how dispatch works for those yet, might be inline, might be another dispatcher. VM entry isn't the blatant push all registers that some others are, state is saved as necessary though a fairly big stack allocation and a pushfq instruction next to one another are a pretty good hint of a VM entry. There are at least 50 of these in this one piece of software. I have no idea how much detail I can go into on this so I'll play safe."}

There's nothing surprising in here: at a function level a function wrapped in Denuvo will take many times longer to execute than one that isn't. A basic dynamic initialisation function could be literally 4 or 5 lines of assembly unprotected and thousands of lines protected. The major stuff is which functions get protected and how they are used in the game. If the game is ever waiting on one of those functions to complete other work that's a performance hit. If the game is doing a bunch of things in parallel and the non-protected code is never stalled waiting for the protected code there's no practical performance hit. Denuvo provide performance profiling and offer three different levels of protection for functions so there's some control for the developers there and the developer chooses which functions get wrapped. Denuvo may recommend but customer has final decision. They should know the execution flow of their game and take some care over which functions they wrap. Balance between making software harder to crack by protecting many functions and keeping it performant by trying to ensure the DRM doesn't slow the code as a whole. DRM will always slow code down, always, however our experience is frame rate and input lag not individual functions and perfectly possible to minimise impact on those. Loading times are a different matter and other factors influencing that."}

They talked about like 20 or 30 p-codes in their Starforce 3 cracks. This is one page of Denuvo doing what it does, each line a p-code. I paused when it had gone through about 300,000 VM functions / handlers / p-codes. They weren't all different but there's a fair few there. I reckon there's over a thousand handlers. That Starforce 3 20-40 p-codes per title versus a thousand here. The way the authentication checks are done is super clever. Have to obtain correct values and seed them into the correct places in the executable. They are often behind encryption and virtualisation. Miss one, the game crashes. There will be 4-500 functions wrapped in Denuvo. Miss one the game crashes. Lastly the anti-tamper. Have to remove it so it thinks that Steam emulator loaded with it is legit. Can't just remove the checks, need the results of some of them for the game to run. To fully bypass a Denuvo game involves a lot of pretty dull work. I'm not going to share my tracer, sorry!

ImHex is a Hex Editor for Windows, MacOS and Linux written in C++ using ImGui. What makes it special is the big focus on reverse engineering and that it's, in contrast to many other programs with similar features, completely free and open source. It includes a completely custom scripting language, similar to 010 Editor's language but more modern, that allows you to define so called \"Patterns\" that can be placed into your data to analyze and decode it. There's also a growing database of scripts to analyze everything from PE executables over Java classes to ARM Microcontroller memory maps. Since the latest release, data can not only be pulled from normal files but also from raw disks and partitions as well as from remote GDB servers. To make file reverse engineering easier, ImHex can disassemble various different instruction sets, calculate and display entropy graphs, diff files and analyze loaded data using Yara rules. It can also guess based on magic values inside files what type of file has been loaded.Besides all of this, there's a Node-based (similar to Unreal Engine Blueprints), data preprocessor which can transform loaded data before displaying it. This allows for example to decrypt AES encrypted data on the fly without modifying the underlying data at all. There's a lot more ImHex can do but probably best to just look at the screenshots on my repo or download and try it out yourself :)In contrast to a year ago, it now ships as portable zips, MSI installers, DMGs, DEBs, FlatPaks and AppImages making installing a lot easier too."}

He was opening some files in ImHex to figure out if they were ELF files. I took a mental note to checkout ImHex and this post was nice reminder :-) I was pleasantly surprised to see on the GitHub page that was a screenshot with a Windows .dll (PE binary) loaded with coloring of HEX, disassemble and more. I didn't see Casey Muratori having colors or anything else fancy when opening the ELF file. I tried opening a Windows .exe (PE binary) myself and I didn't get any colors or other nice decoding of the binary. After a little searching I found the [ImHex patterns repo]( and download the patterns and manually loaded them. This gave me nice coloring of header. When opening the disassembler view, I had to type in the addresses of the assembly code manually. I had a look at the contents of the pattern file and it doesn't look like it specifies which sections are assembly code. Which I think would be a killer feature for reverse engineering. I didn't like that opening new views would open them as a separate window, perhaps they could be tabbed and selected into the currently selected view? I also think the Pattern Data view has too much data and it is a bit difficult to read the name/value pairs when the first column is the Name and the last (6th) column is the Value. Overall I think ImHex has a lot of very nice features and appears to be quite powerful. I'm personally not a huge fan of Dear ImGUI apps because I think they look like very noise ASCII based UIs and I think this leads to poor UX. Perhaps better colors, fonts and less text data on the screen can help improve this :-) If your goal to increase adoption of ImHex, I would work on improving the initial on-boarding experience and general UX. E.g. opening a PE file for the first time should show the hex view, pattern data (less busy version) and dissembler view for all the different sections (probably requires a new kind of disassembler view) with less/nicer colors, better fonts and with all the views nicely docked in the main window. I suggest visually comparing ImHex to some of your own favorite apps that you think have nice UX/UI and see how you can be be \"inspired\" by them ;-) Good luck and I hope to see more cool updates in the future!"}

There's a in-app store where you can download everything that's found on the pattern repo directly from ImHex to make finding that stuff easier. I'm a bit hesitant to include everything in the releases because they can get outdated quickly if I'm not releasing new versions all the time. Opening sections in the disassmbler directly is a great idea! I wanted to redo it for a while but didn't get to it yet. There's three different themes that can be found in the settings if you rather want e.g a light theme. Also changing the font can easily be done by putting a file called font.ttf in the resource folder :) Views just open as windows the first time you open them after which they can be docked to the main window and stay there. The tabs in the pattern data view can be reordered by dragging them around but I can also make some rows be disableable to reduce the clutter a little. Besides that I think it looks more or less the same as 010's data view. I'll definitely try to improve the UX a bit. To me it feels fine but I'm very happy about other views like yours to improve on it. I'm working on this project by myself so I don't really have a second pair of eyes to look over it usually.

Ah, I just found the Content Store in the Help menu. Wasn't obvious to me that it existed. How does it work if I download a pattern and then it gets updated later, does the app notify me of the update? I think it would greatly improve UX if you just bundled them all and the app auto-updates them on launch. Since you already have a store that downloads the patterns, it doesn't sound like a lot of work to support updating them as well. >I'll definitely try to improve the UX a bit. To me it feels fine but I'mvery happy about other views like yours to improve on it. I'm workingon this project by myself so I don't really have a second pair of eyesto look over it usually.

However, if you already got to that point, you could simply trace through the code, maybe set a few memory breakpoints, and find the same pointer purely through debugging. In addition, the crash itself in this case didn't mangle the call stack, so just by attaching a debugger, there was enough of a lead to figure out where the offending code was.

I think they are roughly equivalent, certainly enough to get most jobs done. If find myself reaching for one tool or another depending on the task. I think for windows x64 IDA might have the edge, for a lot of weird stuff or particularly large complex programs where you want to spend a month+ of effort I would pick Ghidra. I\u2019ll try write about some of the main differences: Ghidra\u2019s default view is side by side ASM listing and Decompiler. No one uses Ghidra\u2019s graph view, instead you use the decompilation view for control flow information. I think in general this is superior to a graph. A smaller, third, side panel is the type explorer, where you are encouraged to create your own complex types like: function prototypes/pointers, classes, structures, enums, typedefs. Typing is much better than IDAs text window. You tend to create a lot more types, nest types, and type most variables/parameters/return values you encounter. For example in a network application you would create a the app\u2019s packet header structure, and type any pointers to that packet. Any field dereferences are then shown in the decompiler / ASM listing. You can do this in IDA too, but it is much more natural and works really well in Ghidra. In IDA people just tend to use comments to convey a lot of information, in Ghidra more work would be focused on creating types and having it display it more natively. Adding type information continually improves the quality of the decompilation output until it pretty much reads like C code. I haven\u2019t used IDAs most recent decompilers a lot but I think they have pretty much the same output for the duration of a project. XRefs are very similar across both tools, and for basic stuff completely automated. However, in Ghidra, Xrefs are just an annotation you can manipulate on any line with any kind of reference (like: \u201cCALL\u201d, \u201cJUMP\u201d, \u201cDATA READ\u201d, \u201cCOMPUTED CALL\u201d, etc) to anywhere else. This ends up being super powerful when you are working with micro controllers with unusual memory mappings to things like FLASH and SRAM etc. You can even rebuild complex switch statements or class method calls if you are willing to put the effort in. I am not sure IDA has anything equivalent, or certainly not as a good part of its GUI. IDA shits all over Ghidra when it comes to polish. So many little things just go wrong occasionally that paid development team would probably fix. IDA also has so much better type information for standard libraries built in. You don\u2019t realise how valuable knowing the parameters to CreateProcess is until its missing. Ghidra supports ingesting huge volumes of type information and you can make it just as good, but it sometimes doesn\u2019t work out of the box. I suspect one goal of open sourcing Ghidra is to get everyone to help maintain it. Hopefully that helps..."}

Similarly there is full java native scripts, I don\u2019t even think it is a different api to its internals. I haven\u2019t used it much. There are also python bindings but I have never used them."}

It's a bit of a cop-out answer, but my favorite things about IDA and Hex-Rays are that I have 16 and 12 years of experience with them, respectively. Most of what I want to do, I know how to do off the top of my head and have the keyboard shortcuts memorized. The parts where using them isn't as nice as one might hope, I'm aware of those parts and know what to do about them (working around them, or actually doing the hard work of solving them). I've written tens of thousands of lines of IDA plugin source code in the past 15 years -- plugins with GUIs, loaders, processor modules, processor module extensions, Hex-Rays microcode API plugins, Hex-Rays CTREE plugins. I've reverse engineered parts of IDA, IDAPython, and Hex-Rays to better understand how they work internally and how to better use the SDK. Again, it isn't a great answer, but my favorite parts about IDA and Hex-Rays are that I know how to use them extremely thoroughly, that I have reflexive muscle memory that kicks in any time I want to do something, and that I'd be giving all of that up by switching to a different tool."}

USB, SD, EMMC, SSD drives all use NAND flash for data storage (the only exception I know is some funky Intel SSD pieces), and NAND flash sacrifices *everything* for low costs and high data density - including reliability and data retention. And even with NAND flash, the faults usually happen when data is being erased or written. Which happens fairly often. Those faults could be handled in a sane manner that doesn't result in data loss - it's just that being failure-resilient is not a concern for a typical thumb drive. This piece here uses microcontroller's internal NOR flash memory instead. In general, NOR flash is way more reliable and easier to work with. The microcontroller also basically never writes to it or erases it - it only writes down the keys, and updates the counter of failed password attempts."}

Most HW wallets give you a 24-word seedphrase, but the user can add a \"25th\" word only they know. So you can get your seedphrase backup stolen but they wont be able to access funds, unless the user wrote down the 25th word in there. The risk is that if you suffer from memory loss there's a chance the owner loses access lol 2. You can do a ABC type backup, I don't have all the details but it's basically spreading 3 backups of the same seedphrase in 3 different locations, and you can puzzle out the seedphrase with just 2, so if one location gets compromised you still have access to your backup and the thief wont be able to do much with that piece of the backup. [example]( 3. The steel backups I make are designed to look boring and industrial, to make it extra discreet and not attractive to thieves. One model even has two holes in it so for the extremely anxious people, you can drill it into your wall to avoid theft haha. Point of the steel backup is that if your house burns down you still wont lose the password. Hmm yea you are kinda right it's kinda funny the recommended method is to write it down but because of the nature of crypto, if your seed is exposed on the internet for even just a millisecond, there's a chance someone will steal it and take your funds forever with zero chance of retrieval. So having it in a physical medium is the safest imo."}

After the retry counter is exhausted the SoC just wipes the flash, but that's OK because you still have the image and you can re-write it and continue your brute force where you left off.

So for example, do 0x12345678 AND 0xFF000000, so you can get the value 0x12000000. Not sure what in particular the use case is but hope that helps"}

I've only had a very quick look at it today, but it looks to me that running it in debug mode is so that Ghidra can be debugged rather than Ghidra itself doing any debugging, rather it's opening up the port so a Java debugger of some form (e.g. Eclipse, IntelliJ, etc) can connect to Ghidra and debug it, rather than using Ghidra to debug itself. &#x200B; In the more general case, the debugger & debuggee would be two separate processes, so wouldn't normally have any memory clashes even if running on the same system . The advantage of running the debuggee in a VM would allow you to take a snapshot, which might be useful if you're investigating a hard to reproduce scenario, as you can set things up once, try something then easily revert back to the setup if it didn't work and you want to try something different without needing to do the original setup again. &#x200B;"}

I do have a rework station, but no JTAG jigs or an external programmer, suppose now is as good time as any to get some. The main reason I dont want to commit here is I dont want to reward my boss for silly money saving decisions, because this isn't the first time. Edit: tl;dr on the evos I have the opal state and the encryption keys are stored in the controller, and the keys are encrypted with the master password which we again do not have. This means that without extracting PSID (which is also probably stored as a hash, as the value itself is a 32 character string) wiping the storage itself will do nothing, as OPAL will still be enabled in the controller."}

Yes, it is the *firmware update* files that are distributed in encrypted form. This makes it hard to see what is actually being sent to the drive controller during a firmware update. Getting access to the plain text version of the firmware blobs would be the first step in looking more closely into, for example, how the drive performs full-disk encryption. To be clear: * Samsung distributes SSD firmware updates as encrypted files, inside zip files, inside encrypted files, inside compressed initrd files, inside a iso9660 disc image. * The encryption is pure obfuscation. The samsung firmware update program contains the decryption key - of course it does, becase it has to. How else could it update the firmware? * The really interesting question is: Why is the firmware \"encrypted\", but not signed, instead of the other way around? It would make much more sense to verify that the firmware is authentically from samsung, but instead a light weight obfuscation technique is chosen. I don't know the answer to this, but I'm guessing it involves a Pointy Haired Boss."}

Typeset in LaTeX, you can tell this dude has academic cred haha. As one would suspect he's got a doctorate, but this text is surprisingly one of the most approachable books I've ever read, on par with \"The Art of Electronics\". It's written from an academic POV with annotations for \"the real world\". So while a theoretically correct statement might be : > \"The clock pulses at a fixed frequency (known as the clock speed). When you buy a 1.5 GHz computer, 1.5 GHz is the frequency of this clock 4 .\" He goes out of his way to include the footnote of: >> \"Actually, clock pulses are used in many different components of a computer. The other components often use different clock speeds than the CPU.\" Which, as anyone who's ever laid out a board with one crystal and multiple dividers to edge-trigger different components would know, is very true, but often omitted in books such as these. He continues to explain the basic operations, explaining things from a historical POV (ah/al -> ax -> eax -> rax) 8086 all the way to modern SSE/AVX registers. The best thing about this text is it's self-inclusive. In ASM, coming from C (or worse, a side-effect free functional language), 'jnz' [jump if not zero] is left one scratching their head. Jump if *what!* is not zero? This dude annotates all of his code with carry flags, giving an intuitive feel for \"jump if the ZERO FLAG is not zero\". Then he'll explain \"the zero keeps it state from the last mnemonic that had an affect on ZF, such as a CMP. If you're in a loop, cx is conventionally used as the inc,dec register, so this too may effect the ZF\". He continues to explain different call patterns for c (fastcall, vs cdecl), PE vs COFF vs Pascal vs ELF, system calls, and then finally ending with C/C++ and file manging. All in *under 200 pages*. I've never seen a single book of \"From Idiot to Phd in 7 days\" that worked (usually those books tend to be targeted to idiots who think that's even possible - so counterintuitively if such a book did exist, it wouldn't be titled as such), but if there is such a resource - this is it. The Art of Assembly is a good second piece. The third is a series of texts explaining bootloaders, I don't have the link off hand. Then finish up with Practical Malware Analysis.

The problem isn't an Anti-Cheat problem, its a Linux Kernel attestation problem. Like this article for instance points out, the AC is using ntdll to make userpace requests to the kernel, and this is bypassed *without* the ability to swap kernel modules as you like. The threat space for linux based kernel anti-cheat is way larger than the windows kernel because of how open and flexible linux is. This is also why inversely, an even more restrictive kernel space, like MacOS, doesn't use kernel anti-cheat. Linux support would require a custom kernel/distro that involves some level of kernel attestation, and removes the ability of users to add their own kernel modules, as well as limiting the number of \"approved\" kernel modules because obviously not every random module will be verified. This would basically mean an entirely new operating system completely detached from everything that the linux community generally loves it for."}

The author puts special focus on tool development. The illustrations in the writeup are numerous and detailed, and it is clear that a lot of effort went into reverse engineering the camera and writing this document. The author describes a gradual process of understanding the layouts of the binaries that are accessible to him: determining the firmware package format; recovering an XOR encryption key using a ciphertext-only attack; improving a third-party processor module; obtaining a build environment for the platform; reverse engineering the OMF format; and obtaining FLIRT signatures for platform libraries. With tooling in place, the author moves on to describing the structure of the code in terms of the firmware layout; interrupt handler table; system call format; the tasks running in the operating system; message-passing schema; the GUI and picture formats; and its debug menu. The author is excited to discover that the firmware supports USB Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP), but the stock camera does not support USB -- a $900 peripheral provides a USB connector, however. Rather than buying it, he investigates the socket at the bottom of the camera that would connect to the peripheral, and eventually obtains a compatible part. He builds a breakout board for the socket and probes it with a multimeter. Then, he uses a logic analyzer to observe the traffic sent upon taking a picture/recording a video, and compares it against other cameras he has available. He is unable to get his PC to connect to the device in PTP mode due to unexplained corrupted packets. Finally, he obtains a cheap, used peripheral to connect to the camera. He decides to investigate the USB PTP extensions he saw in the firmware, which is facilitated by an open-source PTP library. Drawing from his knowledge of the firmware, he's able to communicate with the debug interface, which allows him to enable debug logging and dump the raw contents of the camera memory to an SD card. Again, it's a great writeup demonstrating the gradual and cumulative nature of reverse engineering -- reconnaissance, improving tooling support, refining one's picture of a system over time, and exploiting past knowledge to derive further information. This is one of the highest-quality writeups I've ever seen and am likely to ever see. Highly recommended!"}

The copy protection scheme worked like such 1. The outer edge of the disk contained a region that nonstandard and could not be reproduced with a CD burner. 2. The Saturn had a special drive that could read this region to verify the disk's authenticity. The scheme, though, was predictable and the mod chip would feed the drive what the system expected to see whenever the authentication check was happening. Otherwise operation was normal. All the above is pretty complicated and it made the mod chips expensive. That and the Saturn was sort of a flop so not many people were that interested in developing stuff for it. A more elegant solution would be to fool the copy protection mechanism by tweaking it's internal code.. But it turns out the Saturn had a REALLY locked down CD system - Basically a tiny computer inside the Saturn that operated like a black box on it's own dedicated microchip. It's also part of why the Saturn flopped. That's ridiculously over-engineered approach and frankly a waste of time and money. The whole Saturn was designed like this, with lots of little sub-systems. Lots and lots of re-inventing the wheel at every turn. Made the system expensive and a pain to develop for. While it was technically superior to the Playstation, it was a lot harder to develop for. Sony won by making their system cheap and accessible. (And with better marketing, which Sega messed up pretty bad in the Saturn era)"}

The title is pretty enthusiastic - still, this does represent the first exposition of the actual DRM mechanisms in the Saturn. \"Just a YMF292\" is a big sentence in small words. The chip wasn't used anywhere else AFAIK. You could certainly try and pull one out of a Saturn and build your own system around it like people do with SID chips, but it's pretty complicated and I didn't want to do that... though in retrospect it would have been simpler, if less accessible. MIDI support lets you transmit key on/off messages; not sure whether it needs intervention from a CPU to actually activate notes. But it has nothing about configuring the sounds, loading samples -- all the juicy stuff. If you really want to push it hard, you actually need to be running code on the accompaning 68000 CPU, so you can use tricks like fast register manipulation that help get such great sounds out of platforms like the Gameboy."}

Looking for advice on debugging strategy and potential design issues. **Project Status:** Successfully achieved some ink output (cyan, occasional yellow) before hardware failures occurred. Using Jeroen's original KiCad files and exact component specifications. **Hardware Architecture:** * 3-board system: PSU board (3.3V/9V/16V rails), ESP32 board, cartridge control board * MC14504B level converters for 3.3V to 9V/16V translation * Custom power protection circuit for nozzle drive (10\u00b5s pulse limiting) * ESP32-S3 as programmer, GPIO22 substituted for GPIO12 (to avoid using bootstrapping pin) **Current Issues:** 1. **Level Converter Behavior (MC14504B):** * Inconsistent signal propagation delays under load * Some cartridges require timing adjustments to function * DCLK signal integrity issues between ESP32 output and level converter output * Suspected latch-up when VCC pins left floating during initial assembly 2. **Power Supply Problems:** * 9V rail jumping to 15.7V when cartridge connected (should remain 9V) * Current spikes causing brownout detection on ESP32 (triggers at 2.44V threshold) * Final failure: VCC/GND short on ESP32 after power supply voltage drop 3. **Assembly Sequence Issues:** * Initial assembly with floating VCC pins on level converters caused component damage * Replacement of U13 (MC14504B) resolved initial voltage issues * Subsequent failure during operation with cartridge connected **Measurements (V\\_in = 4.2V):** * Idle (no cartridge): 45mA * Cartridge connected, no dispensing: 45mA * Dispensing without cartridge: \\~80mA * Dispensing with cartridge: \\~150mA **Logic Analyzer Results:** * ESP32 outputs appear correct per waveform templates * Power protection circuit functions correctly (10\u00b5s pulse limiting verified) * DCLK signal shows inconsistencies between ESP32 and level converter outputs **Specific Questions:** 1. **Assembly Strategy:** What's the recommended power-up sequence for MC14504B-based designs? Should VCC always be applied before input signals? 2. **Level Converter Issues:** Given MC14504B's limited current output and propagation delays, are there better alternatives for 3.3V to 9V/16V level shifting in this application? 3. **Protection Recommendations:** What additional protection (diodes, current limiting resistors) would prevent ESP32 damage from power supply issues? 4. **DCLK Signal Integrity:** How can I debug and correct the timing inconsistencies in the DCLK path through the level converters?"}

Just adding from my own knowledge. The anti-debugging technique is something they had forever. But the obfuscation is new and came with Legacy of the Void. Conveniently it came out at the same time the last major patch of WoW Legion came out which introduced the same obfuscation. My understanding is they developed an in-house packer that encrypts the binary, first released with Overwatch. TLS callbacks are used to decrypt the content and manually map the executable. Funny enough, some guy made an unpacker until he got a C&D from Blizzard. Though not that it mattered they were changing the packer nearly every update. As for instances of code. StarCraft 2 and games using that engine (e.g. Heroes of the Storm) all use a VM for its gameplay. It uses a scripting language called GalaxyScript which compiles to machine code dynamically, similar to how V8 does it with JaveScript. As for the obfuscated values (e.g. mineral and gas numbers). Those got introduced a few months after Legacy of the Void. I remember because I wrote a map hack when Legacy came out and I was able to cheat in singleplayer by modifying the mineral and gas numbers. A later patch made it difficult to find those numbers. Good thing I already got all the achievements. For my map hack I used deep memory scanning techniques. Essentially I was too lazy to debug and read assembly code to find pointers. So instead I did what I did in Overwatch. I would read all the writable memory of the game, and look for vtables. That is, pointer to a list of pointers pointing to executable regions of memory. That allowed me to find all instances of classes which I could classify based on vtables. Then I grouped them and found the \u201centity\u201d set of classes which had the most instances created. From there I used cheat engine to observe the memory and found things that looked like Vector3 positions, I then mapped them and had my map hack. From there it was just more reverse engineering of interesting structures. It was a technique I adopted from a paper published in 2010 for Supreme Commander. Anyways, good shit! Keep up the amazing work. And look into DMA technologies, my memory analyzer sucked because ReadProcessMemory is so dogshit slow. And it also can trigger hidden memory allocations for cheat detection. DMA is faster and better hidden!"}

Not that it would have mattered too much, people would have continued making cheats. I think what changed is it no longer became economical to make cheats for it. The games are too expensive and have less players when compared to free to play titles with lots of players. Hackers just moved to different games. Also, the SC2 hackers only got fucked after Legacy came out. Before that it was very easy to make hacks for SC2. Only after Legacy came out did Blizzard start taking things more seriously."}

That said, my favorite is manual mapping, though mine has a twist borrowed from malware developers. For debugging, I actually found a way to run game code in my own external process. I read the machine code, and execute it in my own process instruction by instruction in a dedicated thread. Each instruction goes through a disassembler and if I find that it\u2019s a memory reference, I read that part of the memory from the game, rewrite the machine code to reference the address mapped to my own process memory and continue execution. It actually worked for a lot of what I was reversing. Obviously you\u2019ll run into issues if you do operating system calls that need some handle. DMA is direct memory access. Look up PCILeech. It\u2019s essentially a PCIe card that you plug into your gaming computer, and you read all the memory, including kernel memory, from another computer that\u2019s connected to the pcie card over usb. It\u2019s a bit expensive but the prices have really come down in recent years. I managed to get a CS2 hack written in Golang using this. It was fairly easy, the performance is excellent, and most importantly, it\u2019s nearly impossible to detect because no amount of kernel anticheat can detect hacks running on another computer. There\u2019s still ways they can catch you or otherwise prevent you from doing so. But it is a nice evolution on the hacking scene."}

Why is the pointer off by a byte? I have no idea. ARM CPUs need some criteria to switch between ARM mode and Thumb mode when executing a branch instruction. This criteria takes advantage of instruction alignment always being either on 4-byte boundaries for ARM mode, or 2-byte boundaries for Thumb mode. Therefore, bit 0 can be used to encode which mode the code will run in, since no instruction will be placed at an odd address. When bit 0 is set to 1, it runs in Thumb mode, which matches what's decoded on address 0x80223f0. > If you look closely, the function is looking for the 'k' at the wrong spot. I don't know why. Look at the casts. You will notice that `param_1 + 1` does not have the cast to int, so the access is equivalent to `param_1[1]`. Since `param_1` is `uint*`, each array index will advance 4 bytes after the pointer offset. You can edit the function signature, to have `char *param_1`, and the accesses will make more sense, as each index only advances 1 byte at a time: ((((param_1[2] == 'v') && (param_1[3] == 'p')) && (param_1[4] == 'k')) && (param_1[5] == '0'))"}

But there is rarely an explanation how to approach this methodically, because most reversers have learnt it the hard way: They have unpacked so many samples that they intuitively navigate with the debugger.

It felt like there had to be a better way. After a bunch of work, I'm super excited to share what I came up with: [KeyDot]( It extracts the key in just \\~50ms! At the moment there's support for Windows and WASM but I'm planning to add more in the future but I don't have any samples to test on :( This started as a passion project, but I'd love to make it a genuinely useful tool for the community. This is where I could really use your help. I'm super curious to see if it holds up on different kinds of games/versions, So you find a game where it breaks or have any ideas, don't hesitate to open an issue on GitHub This tool is made for the purpose of project recovery in case of lost source code and encryption key"}

We all know the PSP has a second CPU and this since its release. This CPU is part of a specialized unit called the Media Engine, which we've never really been able to exploit to its full potential. This second CPU is a MIPS Allegrex running at 333MHz just like the main one, close to an R4000 arch with its CP0 and an FPU as CP1. But there's also a DSP alongside it! With few dedicated opcodes. On this specialized unit, PSP 1000 has 2MB of local eDRAM, and newer ones have 4MB. And this unit also has access to the main RAM. There are also ping pong buffers linked to the main local DMA. These are 24bit buffers with a size of around 64KB segmented in 8KB. In mid 2005, a homebrewer called crazyc has done crucial work, which included getting code running over there. After him, the scene more or less settled on using the Media Engine, mainly its CPU, by relying on the reverse engineering of the code that gives the main system access to that specialized unit. In my opinion this limited the flexibility of integrating the Media Engine into homebrews and made the sync system between CPUs quite constrained by this 'factory' configuration. On the other hand, we still know very little about the DSP that comes with it. I'm working on this project to dig deeper and see how far we can go with this hardware. Feel free to share, or participate if you think you have something valuable to add, and if you wish, you can join us on discord [PSP Homebrew Community]( to discuss it. Thanks for reading!"}

I\u2019m not here to pitch or sell anything \u2014 just wanted to share what I\u2019ve been building and get feedback from people who actually reverse engineer for work or research. \u2022 What do you think about integrating AI in this space? \u2022 Are there pain points in your Ghidra workflow where you\u2019d actually want AI involved? \u2022 Any concerns (e.g., trust, reproducibility, reliance on AI suggestions) you\u2019d raise?

Unfortunately, rather than choosing to leave all the levels enabled, the shell company which bought the vendor out a few years ago is going to let the bike revert to its \"unpaid\" status rather than, say, pushing a long license at end of renewal. I don't want to lose the interesting rides. Fine, it's Fedora, I've got some skills, time to dig in. Anybody else start down the road on this thing already?"}

What part of the bike runs Fedora ?"}
