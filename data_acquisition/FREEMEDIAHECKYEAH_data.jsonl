Its always good to have places like this we know we can trust. - To make streaming easier to navigate, we've separated [API Frontends]( and [Single Server]( sites into their own sections. - Thank you to Hugo, Samidy, Dan, kick, Anarchydr, and everyone else who helped re-organize, or create the sections this month. *** # Stars Added ⭐ - Starred [Google Assistant]( in Song Identification. Works by humming the songs, seems to be even more accurate than Shazam in our testing. - Starred [Qwen]( in Image Gen. Unlimited, no signup required, seems to be almost as good as 4o as of now. - Starred [Redlib]( in Reddit Tools. Privacy-friendly reddit frontend, works without account. - Starred [keybr]( in Typing Lessons. Custom touch typing practice, has nice UI, multiplayer, profiles, themes, etc. - Starred [Seal]( in Android YouTube Downloaders.

Big catalog, good for batch metadata automation and sorting. - Starred [Beanconqueror]( in Drinks section. Open-source, ad-free, and [feature-rich]( brew tracking app. - Starred [Crosshare]( in Crossword section. Feature-rich, custom UI, active userbase and new puzzles daily. - Starred [CS50]( in Computer Science. Well respected Harvard Computer Science Course. *** # Things Removed - Removed nsw2u, nswdl, ps4pkg, and game-2u as they've been targeted and [shut down]( by the FBI. - Removed InstallGentoo Wiki as its been taken over by trolls. As of now the site should be avoided (NSFL content), but we'll consider re-adding if the situation ever gets handled. - Removed HuggingChat as its [shut down]( Note that HuggingFace still works, its only chat that's gone. - Removed Cobalt from YT downloaders as it [no longer supports YouTube]( Note that it still supports other video sites, so we've kept it in other sections it fits in. - Removed Masquerade Repacks as they've [called it quits]( note that kaos itself is still going strong. *** ### [Previous Update Threads]( *** ### RSS Feed: *** *Note - These update threads only contains major updates. If you're interested in seeing all minor changes you can follow our [Commits Page]( on GitHub or [Updates Channel]( in Discord.

For all Android users missing Cobalt, get ReVanced, then hook up the YouTube download buttons to Seal for something even FASTER and more customizable than Cobalt! It's a bit of extra work setting it all up (though if it asks for the filename/location, type \"com . junkfood . seal\" but without the spaces in-between!), but it's a much smoother experience in the end! For all Apple users, I'm sorry for your loss."}

By sharing a pool of physical resources (such as CPU, RAM, and disks) multiple “machines” can run simultaneously, increasing resource utilisation efficiency and functionality, without the need for separate computers.\" This definition is about what a VM can do, not about what a VM is (apart from a \"logically defined approach to computing\"). I'd change the first part to something like: \"A Virtual Machine (VM) is a software version of a computer system emulated on a real computer. Use of VMs allow multiple versions of computer systems to be run simultaneously on the same hardware. These versions can be the same as the underlying 'real' architecture, or emulate different architecture, allowing for software designed for one system to be run on another. \""}

Since I haven't had much time to use my PC due to work, I did suspect it could be the W11 Godot activator but kinda brushed it off, after all, it was downloaded from FileCR, right? The last straw, however, was when a weird Documents folder in cyrlic got created in the root folder, so it was most probably coming from my computer... After wiping everything out, one of the first things I did was activate W11, then it created a UpdateInfo.json. file on desktop which was an obvious red flag. When opened on notepad, it had some lines like \"updated 11.0.49 packetshare blahblahblah\" and a download link — after some quick googling I found out developers can integrate this Packetshare thing into their programs to profit by \"sharing\" user's Internet. Some similar json files were on Windows folders. By using virus total scan I also found the %temp% files mentioned in OP's post... and speed drops came back. Got another pen-drive, did a fresh W10 install and so far everything's fine. Could've been something else, yeah, it's too much of a coincidence though. I feel kinda bad, years of pirating with caution and this happens... :("}

Malwarebytes is one of the very best you can get. Kaspersky. Now this may be controversial, but personally I think it just got caught up in a proxy war between US and Russia. Eugene Kaspersky himself swore he isn't sharing any info with Russian gov because if he got caught just once, even if there was a tiniest suspicion, his business would be royally screwed and finished, and even Russia doesn't want to lose one of its bigger companies that contributes so much to the economy."}

Sorry for the dumb question :/ EDIT: i think I've fixed my own problem by checking the SpotX FAQ and whitelisting their app in my antivirus settings :) EDIT 2: Turns out that didn't quite work but I ended up temporarily disabling my antivirus and worked smoothly lmao."}

Ich bin insbesondere \u00fcber folgende Punkte besorgt: \u2022 Dieser Vorschlag wurde von demokratischen Institutionen wiederholt abgelehnt oder blockiert. Das Europ\u00e4ische Parlament stimmte gegen Massen\u00fcberwachung, und der Rat konnte seit \u00fcber zwei Jahren keine Mehrheit daf\u00fcr finden. \u2022 Der Gesetzesentwurf zur Chatkontrolle stellt einen beispiellosen Versto\u00df gegen unser Grundrecht auf Privatsph\u00e4re dar. Massen\u00fcberwachung privater Kommunikation ist unvereinbar mit Artikel 7 der EU-Grundrechtecharta. \u2022 Dieses Gesetz w\u00fcrde die digitale Wirtschaft der EU sch\u00e4digen, Technologieunternehmen vertreiben und unsere Wettbewerbsf\u00e4higkeit gegen\u00fcber Regionen, die digitale Rechte und Innovationen sch\u00fctzen, untergraben. \u2022 Das Aufbrechen der Ende-zu-Ende-Verschl\u00fcsselung w\u00fcrde alle EU-B\u00fcrger Cyberkriminellen, autorit\u00e4ren Regimen und ausl\u00e4ndischer Einflussnahme aussetzen. Starke Verschl\u00fcsselung ist f\u00fcr unsere digitale Sicherheit und wirtschaftliche Wettbewerbsf\u00e4higkeit unerl\u00e4sslich. Technische Experten und Kinderschutzorganisationen weisen darauf hin, dass dieser Ansatz Kinder nicht wirksam sch\u00fctzt und gleichzeitig massive Datenschutzverletzungen mit sich bringt. Stattdessen brauchen wir gezielte, evidenzbasierte L\u00f6sungen. KI-basiertes Content-Scanning f\u00fchrt zu zahlreichen Fehlalarmen und kann so unschuldige Familienfotos und -gespr\u00e4che kriminalisieren. Die technische Umsetzung ist grundlegend fehlerhaft und unzuverl\u00e4ssig. Ich fordere Sie dringend auf: \u2022 Stimmen Sie gegen jeden Vorschlag, der eine Massen\u00fcberwachung privater Kommunikation vorschreibt. \u2022 Sch\u00fctzen Sie Ende-zu-Ende-Verschl\u00fcsselung und digitale Datenschutzrechte. \u2022 Unterst\u00fctzen Sie gezielte, evidenzbasierte Ans\u00e4tze zum Kinderschutz. \u2022 Sorgen Sie f\u00fcr eine angemessene demokratische Kontrolle dieser Gesetzgebung. \u2022 Lehnen Sie die vom Europ\u00e4ischen Parlament beschlossene Verl\u00e4ngerung der vor\u00fcbergehenden Ausnahmeregelung (mit freiwilligen Scan-Regelungen) von der Verabschiedung des Vorschlags zur obligatorischen Chat-Kontrolle durch den Rat ab. Der aktuelle Vorschlag schafft kein Gleichgewicht zwischen Kinderschutz und Grundrechten und w\u00fcrde einen gef\u00e4hrlichen Pr\u00e4zedenzfall f\u00fcr digitale \u00dcberwachung in der EU schaffen. Vielen Dank f\u00fcr Ihre Aufmerksamkeit f\u00fcr diese wichtige Angelegenheit. Mit freundlichen Gr\u00fc\u00dfen [Ihr Name und Ihre Adresse]"}

Why are they on earth? What are we doing here? Whats our purpose? *Whats the point?* For most of my life, I didn't really have any answer, but as I got older, I realized, things weren't about me. I took a step back, and recognized a much bigger picture we're all apart of, and I now know exactly why we're here on earth. As a human, you have a powerful ability, to calm, heal, and help those around you. You have the ability to protect both the people in our world, and the planet itself from harm and distress. I know there is a huge amount of pain in our world, a lot of anger, a lot of sadness, and believe me when I say, I share the same feelings. However I believe its important that we each learn to ***harness that energy into things that are positive and kind***, not negative or evil. Remember that a lot of who you are, is your ability to experience things outside of yourself, *including other humans.* They are a direct and immediate part of your own reality. Treat their struggles and woes as if they were your own, don't leave people behind, don't leave people unloved. As frustrating as the world can be, it is worth protecting, it is worth loving, it is worth healing together. *** * *\"Throw yourself flat on the ground, stretched out upon Mother Earth, with certain conviction that you are one with her and she with you...\"* - [Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger, Nobel Prize-Winning physicist]( * *\"Life is a beautiful, magnificent thing, even to a jellyfish... The trouble is you won't fight. You've given in, continually dwelling on sickness and death. But there's something just as inevitable as death, and that's life. Life, life, life. Think of all the power that's in the universe, moving the earth, growing the trees. That's the same power within you if you only have the courage and the will to use it.\"* - Charlie Chaplin, Limelight 1952 * *\"The wise man beholds all beings in the Self, and the Self in all beings; for that reason, he does not hate anyone.\"* - Isa Upanishad"}

We empty ourselves of all the ego things that make us competitive, envious, hateful and as we do we add to the force moving us toward a new way of being.

And I realize that I now very much lack empathy except to those that are extremely close to me and even then I feel there's not a full amount. There's also a little there with people that have shared stories with me, but again it's not fully there. It also doesn't help that I have anxiety that narrows my vision to just making sure I am safe and not paying much attention to details outside of the limited area surrounding me. But whether that came before or after I'm not sure. In any case you're definitely right; it aint healthy for us."}

I was in survival mode, I could not take enjoyment from much of anything outside of my cat which help keep me feeling human. Slowly I began to be able to be in nature and feel something more than pain. The sun, the squirrels, geese, ducks, coyotes, sea gulls, dolphins. All the animals and birds as I payed them attention helped me connect with some of my humaness. Also trees, I watched them in the wind, I let their movement hypnotize me I focused on them so hard. Therapy helped, EMDR, I highly recommend it along with nature. Also try to be kind to yourself. I hate that it is true but you really can't give what you don't have.
