Now that V2 is using hash tables, it's much, much faster than V1 (which is awesome, thank you!). Now, I'm wondering if there's a way to use V2 and pull items from the ForwardedEvents log on my server where I have log collecting set up and working. Best I can tell, all I need to do is edit the $Script:ReportDefinitions variable to have it pull from ForwardedEvents rather than the Security log. I did this, and it sees the correct number of events, but it does not actually parse them or do anything with them at all. Here's what I'm seeing: [Info] Events scanned found 206 - Time elapsed: 0 days, 0 hours, 0 minutes, 31 seconds, 886 milliseconds [Info] Running ADUserChanges [Info] Running ADUserChanges with subsection Events [Info] Ending ADUserChanges with subsection Events events found 0 [Info] Ending ADUserChanges - Time to run 0 days, 0 hours, 0 minutes, 0 seconds, 20 milliseconds [Info] Running ADUserChangesDetailed [Info] Running ADUserChangesDetailed with subsection Events [Info] Ending ADUserChangesDetailed with subsection Events events found 0 [Info] Ending ADUserChangesDetailed - Time to run 0 days, 0 hours, 0 minutes, 0 seconds, 14 milliseconds [Info] Running ADComputerChangesDetailed [Info] Running ADComputerChangesDetailed with subsection Events [Info] Ending ADComputerChangesDetailed with subsection Events events found 0 [Info] Ending ADComputerChangesDetailed - Time to run 0 days, 0 hours, 0 minutes, 0 seconds, 15 milliseconds The query is correct as well, if I copy the \"Constructed Query List\" that gets output with the -verbose operator and paste it into a custom view, I see the appropriate number of events. Any ideas why it sees the events but doesn't seem to do anything with them?

Not by choice, but more like lack of time - being preoccupied with work and working on some cool PowerShell based projects. One of those projects which required a lot of effort and understanding of how Group Policies work is GPOZaurr. So today you get to meet it yourself - let me know what you think :-) A blog post about it (to get more details): * [ Source codes: * [ GPOZaurr is a free PowerShell module that contains a lot of different small and large cmdlets. Today's focus, however, is all about one command, Invoke-GPOZaurr. Invoke-GPOZaurr Just by running one line of code (of course, you need the module installed first), you can access a few built-in reports. Some of them are more advanced, some of them are for review only. Here's the full list for today. Not everything is 100% finished. Some will require some updates soon as I get more time and feedback. Feel free to report issues/improve those reports with more information. * GPOBroken \u2013 this report can detect GPOs that are broken. By broken GPOs, I mean those which exist in AD but have no SYSVOL content or vice versa \u2013 have SYSVOL content, but there's no AD metadata. Additionally, it can detect GPO objects that are no longer GroupPolicy objects (how that happens, I'm not able to tell - replication issue, I guess). Then it provides an easy way to fix it using given step by step instructions. * GPOBrokenLink \u2013 this report can detect links that have no matching GPO. For example, if a GPO is deleted, sometimes links to that GPO are not properly removed. This command can detect that and propose a solution. * GPOOwners \u2013 this report focuses on GPO Owners. By design, if Domain Admin creates GPO, the owner of GPO is the domain admins group. This report detects GPOs that are not owned by Domain Admins (in both SYSVOL and AD) and provides a way to fix them. * GPOConsistency \u2013 this report detects inconsistent permissions between Active Directory and SYSVOL, verifying that files/folders inside each GPO match permissions as required. It then provides you an option to fix it. * GPODuplicates \u2013 this report detects GPOs that are CNF, otherwise known as duplicate AD Objects, and provides a way to remove them. * GPOList \u2013 this report summarizes all group policies focusing on detecting Empty, Unlinked, Disabled, No Apply Permissions GPOs. It also can detect GPOs that are not optimized or have potential problems (disabled section, but still settings in it) * GPOLinks \u2013 this report summarizes links showing where the GPO is linked, whether it's linked to any site, cross-domain, or the status of links. * GPOPassword \u2013 this report should detect passwords stored in GPOs. * GPOPermissions \u2013 this report provides full permissions overview for all GPOs. It detects GPOs missing readmissions for Authenticated Users, GPOs that miss Domain Admins, Enterprise Admins, or SYSTEM permissions. It also detects GPOs that have Unknown permissions available. Finally, it allows you to fix permissions for all those GPOs easily. It's basically a one-stop for all permission needs. * GPOPermissionsAdministrative \u2013 this report focuses only on detecting missing Domain Admins, Enterprise Admins permissions and allows you to fix those in no time. * GPOPermissionsRead \u2013 similar to an administrative report, but this one focuses on Authenticated Users missing their permissions. * GPOPermissionsRoot \u2013 this report shows all permissions assigned to the root of the group policy container. It allows you to verify who can manage all GPOs quickly. * GPOPermissionsUnknown \u2013 this report focuses on detecting unknown permissions (deleted users) and allows you to remove them painlessly. * GPOFiles \u2013 this report lists all files in the SYSVOL folder (including hidden ones) and tries to make a decent guess whether the file placement based on extension/type makes sense or requires additional verification. This was written to find potential malware or legacy files that can be safely deleted. * GPOBlockedInheritance \u2013 this report checks for all Organizational Units with blocked inheritance and verifies the number of users or computers affected. * GPOAnalysis \u2013 this report reads all content of group policies and puts them into 70+ categories. It can show things like GPOs that do Drive Mapping, Bitlocker, Laps, Printers, etc. It's handy to find dead settings, dead hosts, or settings that no longer make sense. * NetLogonOwners \u2013 this report focuses on detecting NetLogon Owners and a way to fix it to default, secure values. NetLogonPermissions \u2013 this report provides an overview and assessment of all permissions on the NetLogon share. * SysVolLegacyFiles \u2013 this report detects SYSVOL Legacy Files (.adm) files. Of course, GPOZaurr is not only one cmdlet - but those reports are now exposed and easy to use. This time I've not only focused on cmdlets you can use in PowerShell, but something that you can learn from and get the documentation at the same time. To get yourself up and running you're just one command away: Install-Module GPOZaurr -Force Here are some screenshots to show you what the command does. Most of the reports have a description, a chart, data, and a solution to fix your issue. &#x200B; &#x200B; &#x200B; Enjoy. If you like my work, I would be grateful for a star or two on Github. Thank you."}

I've found so much crap in GPOs thanks to GPOZaurr that even thinking about it now makes me proud.

BUILTIN\\Administrators is WellKnownAdministrative group and from a safety point of view - it's safe. I just believe that this is actually error on Microsoft side for any new domain that is created, and would consider it a bug on their side. Maybe there's a reason why can't it have proper owners in both places from the start - but I don't know. Maybe some day I'll went thru the effort to report this as a bug and see what happens. Again - treat what GPOZaurr tells you as a learning exercise - don't trust it blindly. I did my effort, it works for me, I'm fine with the change - but again - you don't have to. None of the errors warrant to just follow whatever you said. It's safe to keep it as you have it. Hope this helps"}

My problem with Get-Help is that you first need to update the help files and that may be fine on my own PC but I often work on different systems than my own and updating the help files would not just be inconvenient, it would be impossible due to the firewall rules in place. Another thing is that the help pages themselves look better inside a browser so updating the help files just so I can write \"Get-Help <SomeCommand> -Online\" feels a bit silly. As for Get-Member, listing a bunch of property/method names is not going to help out someone who is new to Powershell and maybe even scripting/programming in general. \"Select-Object \\*\" is much more useful because it shows those same property names as well as examples of what that data might look like so you don't have to guess if for example the \"Extension\" property of a [System.IO.FileInfo] object includes \".\" or not."}

Yet if you know your completion contents apriori, then you can be just as fast with any other tab completion mode. So there's just no advantage to TabCompleteNext. However, even if you know the completion contents, if I am thinking about TabCompleteNext correctly (and I may not be), if you tab on an ambiguous letter it can skip to the next alphabetical completion and fuck you, forcing you to somehow tab or backspace to the word you were trying to complete.

In this scenario, you\u2019re not sure whether that data is made available by the object. That\u2019s when you\u2019d use \u201cGet-Member\u201d as it lists for you the properties you can choose from for whichever command or module you piped over."}

It takes longer to read, more cycles to understand, and is harder to maintain. It can also be slower, but most PWSH code doesn't need to be highly performant. Bad code also gets copied by people who are learning and don't know any better. It's important to keep code as clean and concise as possible. Take these examples: $animal = 'cat' #'hard' way switch ($animal) { 'horse' { $legs = 4 } 'cat' { $legs = 5 } 'octopus' { $legs = 8 } 'human' { $legs = 2 } 'penguin' { $legs = 2 } } #'easy' way $legs = switch ($animal) { 'horse' { 4 } 'cat' { 5 } 'octopus' { 8 } 'human' { 2 } 'penguin' { 2 } } I would argue that the second option is much easier to maintain. Then of course there's a hashtable, which I would argue is easier still: $animalHash = @{ horse = 4 cat = 5 octopus = 8 human = 2 penguin = 2 } $legs = $animalHash[$animal] When you have monster scripts that are 300+ lines an there's a ton of this kind logic throughout it over and over, it addes up."}

It may be new-ish to powershell but it's in virtually every other language with C-like syntax. case in point: I just googled both examples. Example 1 gives me a bunch of incorrect results describing normal if/else blocks in various languages (none of which as far as I bothered to keep scrolling were powershell and none of which described usage similar to this). Example 2 gives me an AI explanation of the conditional operator that explains exactly what that line of code means. Admittedly the regular search results are not helpful as for some reason Google wants to turn '$x= $a ? 1 : 2' into algebraic notation for exponentiation (no idea where it gets x^(1/2) from that search string but Google does odd things with non-alphanumeric chars sometimes), but if I simplify it a bit to something like x = a ? b : c I get plenty of helpful results."}

The tool will be developed further, based on your suggestions. This tool is for the community, so I will try to keep it FREE, donation/ad based. The tool is for you, now this is what I would like you to do for me: SHARE this tool with everyone :) Comment here with suggestions, what features from full fledged designers like Visual Studio you would like to see implemented first. I hope to implement most of them, but you need to tell me which are the most important for you :) From comments and messages I gather the priority is: - Tutorial for guys without win form experience - Add click events - Add group and progress bar controls - Add more properties to existing controls The tool will be designed by your comments so feel free to comment :) thanks everybody for suggestion here and by the feedback form on the site, I currently have no time to answer every one but I take note of every single suggestion, keep them coming."}

Came in perfect today when I needed to add a radio box to a simple deployment script. Couple of suggestions for it. Change \"$Form.ShowDialog()\" to \"[void]$Form.ShowDialog()\" If $Form.ShowDialog() is called inside of a powershell function with a return variable, the dialog will corrupt the return variable, turning it into an array of values instead just the returned one. Also, after $Form.ShowDialog() there really should be a $Form.Dispose() -- otherwise it can have a tendency to crash the ISE due to memory leaks. On forms, I like to add in this line: $Form.Topmost = $True Otherwise, sometimes windows has a tendency to pop-up your form behind the powershell window, and it's annoying to find. Last, and this is more a style thing than anything else, I'd suggest adding a checkbox to the buttons for \"Closes dialog\" which would add this line of code: $OKButton.Add_Click({$Form.Close()}) You can get to it under Events, but if you're not used to closing forms, it might be confusing."}

The Write-Host cmdlet now uses the Information stream (6), because it's just a wrapper. In fact, the $InformationPreference variable doesn't even affect it. But, the most important caveat to Write-Host still exists - it does not emit to standard output/pipeline. Try this: `Write-Host \"This is a test\" > somefile.txt` A file will be created, and the message will be displayed on the screen, but the message will not make it to the file. There is really only one scenario that I take issue with, because almost all code developed where I work is designed for automation and touchless operation - if you don't write to standard out, you don't get redirection, and you can't make log files very useful if you don't emit all the information you send to the terminal to standard out. I know there are counter-examples. I know not everyone designs this way. I know this is up to personal preference. But if I had my way, everyone would learn to emit messages the safest way possible. A message you mean to emit that is not capturable is not a useful message. Most people use Write-Host because you can do pretty things with it. If that's important, by all means. I would argue, however, that it is probably more important to make information readable and understandable than it is to be pretty - if you have to colorize your log messages to make them understandable, I think you probably need to re-evaluate the meaning of the message. Again, though, this is just personal/institutional opinion. In fact, if you just said \"But I like it!\" that's enough justification, I won't and can't argue. My only position here is to say that it comes with risks - your informed choice is all that matters. ETA: I did a bit of testing on several different systems, using the above example with PS v5/6, and found my statement to be true still. I'm open to learning that this is in fact not an issue anymore - that would indeed be cool!"}

I don't want all crap that in a log. In fact that's pretty much the main reason why I use ``Write-Host`` because it *doesn't* output to stdout.

The vast majority of the time when I see someone using Write-Host it's because it is known as the defacto output tool. And that's not the case, in actual fact, because there are many good tools for writing output. The issue I have with my own use of Write-Host is as I described, a set of circumstances which I design around, and I don't think everyone else needs to have that same philosophy. But I do think everyone needs to know about all the tools you \\*can\\* use, and why and when to use them. My particular philosophy is just a perspective of how the selection of the tool to write my output informs my design choice.

Absolutism in programming is something we fight at work all the time, there is a lot of dogma around how you should or shouldn't build something. And certainly I would be a hypocrite if I offered that here. My first comment probably sent this off the rails so it's my fault, but let me try to clarify again: The point I was making about Write-Host is driven by my own philosophy about what I expect my programs to do. I can't very well expect everyone else to have the same philosophy, and I don't. What I do like to think, though, is that we can all think of the ways in which our programs can handle different situations, and how that informs our designs. In my particular case that means in order to design something that runs well in my environments I really have to avoid Write-Host, it just wouldn't be useful. But it wouldn't be catastrophic. It would be bad in that I wouldn't get the output I need, that's all. But again that's only in my situation. Your situation is guaranteed to be different and your design needs to do what you need it to do. So why am I advocating against using Write-Host? In a sense I'm not. You should use the tool that fits what you need to do, that's always the right tool to use. All I want is for us to understand why we use the tool we choose, and not use Write-Host because it is the canonical default. You do you, I certainly can't do better than you can in meeting your needs, and that means you choose the tool for the job. If Write-Host is the tool you need, it's the tool you use!"}

Today most things are plug and play, but back then you had to worry about interrupt conflicts and many other hardware issues to get things to run right. Lee was always a fun, joyful, and quirky character, tall and very slender, and I'll always have a fond memory of working with him. He also always had a smile on his face and he had a habit of always twirling his moustache or beard with his hands while he talked with a big smile on his face.

Stealing/adapting /u/Szeraax's code from below: function Get-CryptoBit { param ($rng) $byte = New-Object -TypeName byte[] -ArgumentList 1 $rng.GetBytes($byte) $byte[0] % 2 } $rng = [System.Security.Cryptography.RandomNumberGenerator]::Create() 1..10 | %{,(1..10000 | %{Get-CryptoBit $rng} | group | sort-object Name) | % {[pscustomobject]@{$_[0].name = $_[0].count;$_[1].name = $_[1].count;}}} You'll see the results are far closer (and it's far slower). The results are quite interesting to plot in Excel/your favourite spreadsheet/chart plotting software. Compare the distribution of numbers from `Get-Random`, `Get-CryptoBit`, and a version of `Get-CryptoBit` with the random number generator re-created each time, rather than created once and passed as a parameter.

After a month or so we found our shopping bills had cut down by 40-50% as there was little to no waste due to things that seemed like a good idea when shopping or we just didn't have time to make. This had some issues; we would get duplicates, we couldn't tell which would make enough for leftovers for lunch the day after and most importantly we had to check the recipes for that week and work out a shopping list. This script addresses those issues and generates a (poorly written) HTML page for the menu and one for the shopping list which can then be printed or whatever you need to do with it. &#x200B; A copy of the script can be found here on Github: [ Update the RecipesList.xlsx with your own. *It doesn't do Mondays and Fridays as we don't need these but if you don't go to my mum's house for tea on a Monday or Friday then you can fix this by commenting out lines 172 and 173.*"}

I have a question however. We restrict ourselves from running \"admin\" functions on our regular user systems (and there's far too much involved in running these scripts even if i wanted to run them from my \"regular\" laptop; both with UAC so that its elevated, and \"As a different user\" that user being a DomainAdmin user). Instead we use a jump host to logon to as our DomainAdmin user (cyberark regulated). There in that profile, i have a Microsoft.PowershellISEProfile.ps1 which auto-loads all my regular cmdlet's so that my environment is completely all setup to avoid niggling errors (like executionpolicy, activedirectory, OKTA cmdlets, grouppolicy, etc). Ok, great, no worries there, and I was able to run the scripts. Awesome... except... they take wayyyyyy too long to run even when cut back to like \"Last3days\" for DatesRange. And our jump host (because it IS an admin station) screen-locks after 15 min, and completely logs off the current session if you don't touch it for another 15 min (30 total). That's not something we're going to change... **Instead, (here is the \"ask\")...** should there not be cmdlet switches that allows me to output to folder? The current commands/switches assumes you are sitting at the monitor and never leave for many minutes/hours... and then pops up the out-htmlview and testimo. &#x200B; I can probably figure out how to \"Start-Job\" it, so I can walk away, but by time I get back, the output will have spawn a \"current view\" but have closed the entire session down so i loose out by hook or crook. (would it be Out-HMTL -HTML? or FilePath? I am guessing the latter?) &#x200B; Any here in this regard would be greatly appreciated! And again, nice work!"}

Basically, that command has -Forest, -IncludeDomains, -ExcludeDomains, -IncludeDomainControllers, -ExcludeDomainControllers and -SkipRODC parameters. This allows you to precisely target with it what you want. For example, you could tell it to exclude the dead domain. Or only include 3 out of 5 domains. or only include 5 out of 500 dcs or skip read-only domain controllers. This approach is done for almost all my commands in ADEssentials and it will also be available for Find-Events in near future. When you pass something to include domain, exclude domain is ignored. Same for include dcs vs exclude dcs. If you put a netbios name of DC in IncludeDomains it will find all \"matching\" DCS for all domains. If you have DC1.domain1, DC1.domain2 it will find both DCs and target both. If you give full dns name for DC it will be more specific. You can check it using Get-WinADDiagnostics how it works."}

There's a general attitude you'll see among some systems administrators where there's just an outright apathy if not resentment for anything resembling development and programming. We tend to call these people. ClickOps. Even if you're planning on staying in operations, I always advise people that they should learn basic programming fundamentals like source control. One of the key reasons I advocate for this style is honestly out of pure concern for their careers. Over the 20 years I've been doing IT, I've seen more and more things shift towards being a hybrid of development and operations (DevOps) where some degree of programming skill is mandatory, And I fear there will be a day where your lack of programming skills and the fact you can only operate in a GUI Will become very unpalatable to hiring managers."}

One of the problems we had with our SCOM setup were systems that stopped reporting in, so I used Powershell to build a \"grey state\" survey tool that would attempt to connect to (and run tests on) any system in inventory that hadn't reported in for a given timeframe. Depending on what the tests revealed, we could then write events to a central admin system, which would then post alarms to SCOM / generate tickets on behalf of the systems that were unaccounted for. We found a lot of systems that had been decommissioned (but not removed properly from inventory!) as well as boxes that didn't return from patch reboots in a stable state. There were also a few systems that were working, but had gotten isolated by the network people turning off ports that they either fatfingered, or lost the documentation on (they closed ports that weren't written into THEIR server inventory).

Just having basic knowledge of powershell scripting will put you ahead of a lot of similar candidates without such a skill. Additionally, my examples are more mundane. I try to write powershell scripts for anything that takes longer than a minute or could be easily affected by human error. Here are some of the scripts I've created. Automated file hash checking, download a file, face the hash to a text document in the folder, point the script at it and it'll tell you for match our no match with the calculated and expect hash, highlighting the difference between them. The alternative, using some random GUI tool that someone else wrote and I have to trust. O365 one drive backend provisioning and setup for new users. It streamlines the user process and can be required for various pre-start items to have a users one drive provisioned prior to login. It's so much easier just running the script, modern auth'ing in, and copying a comma separated list of users or importing a csv then you're done. Anything Hyper-V. Just don't bother yourself with that sucky GUI, just don't. Handling logfiles, simple backups and directory copy operations. Pretty much anyone you do in command prompt can be done in powershell. I'm not even a sys admin but a network engineer. I'm sure sys admins would have a ton more basic tasks that are perfect for automation."}

The GUI is more than good enough for adding users, creating and changing distro groups, shared boxes, etc. Sure, there are a few PS commands I need to run, like autoexpanding the email archive, but that's basically it. Unless missing a huge advantage, I can see PS taking me longer to do my basic tasks. To create a user or reset a PW is like 5 clicks via GUI."}

The company i was with had tje mindset of \"if its not broke dont fix\" and \"embrace the workarounds\"...and the documentation was decades out of date... So i started writing the updated processes and sharing them with the team as a living draft document so we could ensure capture and retention of knowlege gained from the vets who had been with the company through its 3x legacy system changes. When i was finally asked to do process documentation full time (after 3 years of doing it in addition to the 5 other hats i wore l) they were only using sharepoint as a glorified fileshare. None of the tasking, automation, wiki pages, calendar, project tracking, nothing. I hadnt had any official experience as a project manager nor technical writer and the handoff was terrible (spent nearly a week trying to dig thru the MESS of multiple draft files on the remote drive) but its really not terribly hard to find tutorials or how to's. Like...nobody had even heard of a gantt chart... Even stuff as simple as me taking my first crack at power automate for flagging documents that a user has indicated something is needing to be changed/updated was novel to upper management. I never dabbled much in it either but in the first week of my attempting to grasp the scale of my new project i noticed it and decided to do some exploratory probing into it and saw how much simpler it could make a ton of administrative \"busy\" work. Also the amount of time in meetings wasted with \"where are we at with XYZ\" being able to be changed to an email felt really nice. Real shame that they basically undid everything i did when i had to leave (the company we contracted to was mandating 100% on-site which was something i was not able to do as a new father and had just signed a new contract for hybrid 3/2) the handoff to the new \"sme\" wanted to go back to how they used to run it 20 years ago (and they were also the one who fusterclucked the documentation but nobody will ever caugh up loudly to address it) with excel spreadsheets and by sending document drafts in static states via email for people to edit and then send back.....like yall we have live document editing and special file permissions and restricted users and so many other tools now...but i digress.

Since then I have written extensive Batch files (anyone remember 4DOS?) and VBS scripts up until 2014. Had a small project and decided to finally try PowerShell. Was hooked after this tiny 15 line script could do what would have taken 3x that in VBS. I transitioned to 100% in the next 30 days and never looked back. PowerSell is just so capable. Today, I have at least one (more like 2-5) Terminal windows open every day at work. When someone needs info fast or needs to change something on more than one computer, I get that done with PowerShell. If it needs to be automated, PowerShell. When s*** hits the fan, I can use PowerShell to start figuring things out before anyone else can even get on the servers."}

Getting close to finished product and your post is an inspiration which I really need to polish last features."}

If you built a new environment, make sure not to install the default plug-ins the first start wizard suggests, this bloats a whole bunch of dev tools into your instance which you'll probably never need. A quick overview of what you need to do to get started: 1. Install Jenkins 2. Uncheck \"install recommended plug-ins\" or something like that 3. Add a node in the setups and install a Jenkins Slave somewhere 4. Add a label to the node to restrict which jobs run on it, for example the hostname 5. Install the Git and the Powershell Plugin from the Plugin Manager 6. Create a job, put your label into the label field, set a job name, add a \"build action\" with \"run Powershell script\", put some code like 'Write-Host(\"Hello World\")' into the field, leave all other fields empty, click save 7. Run the job 8. Check the job log on the left side and see how your Job was executed on the Node you put into the label field. You can review the status and console log there. A few recommendations: - Don't use the master itself to run scripts for various reasons. - Exchange the Java instance Jenkins delivers with the installer against a 64 bit OpenJDK - Try out other plugins like Artifacts (which allows you to collect file results from the Powershell scripts) - While trying other plugins, remember to delete those you aren't using to keep the instance clean - stick to the least privilege principle for the service account running the nodes I'll attach a guide from Adams Blog in a minute. Edit: Here are two great articles about this. Basic setup guide describing better what I tried above: Guide which shows how and why to use Git for the scripts:"}

When it comes to data that can be identified with a single key they're amazing, but it gets funky when you have data sets that you want to cross reference. For that I use SQLite for most of my stuff and you can even create in-memory databases which can be quite an amazing tool for complex data parsing."}

I have a process that deals with millions of elements and takes quite a while, so I was doing some speed comparisons of lists and dictionaries versus array lists and hashtables.

The same rules apply to using the pipeline. The pipeline is always slower than using for/foreach, but it\u2019s almost always simpler and faster to code."}

If that 10% is still way less work than manually doing the task for 3 months, it's worth it. Example ... Takes 10 mins to do a task 30 times per week... 5 hours per week, or 60 hours per quarter. If it takes 10 hours to script and debug that shit... I figure 20. Take 2 hours per month upkeep. 6 is obviously way less time than 60. Obvious win. But a task that takes 30 min per week... 6 hours per quarter. Yes it sucks, but you don't save ant time and actually wasted time to automate it.

We also have a custom attribute (for internal purposes) that notes what OS they're using, since we have users across Windows, Mac, and Linux environments.

I guess you could put the prior command in parenthesis with [0] at the end, but why when typing \"| gm\" to get what you need is faster and gives you the actual info you're looking for. That's why there's a -First 1 parameter in Select-Object so if anything, Select-Object will return faster than Get-Member since -First X stops the pipeline early."}

There are several pre-built security baselines out there including baselines from various government orgs and vendors (Microsoft). This tool is specifically for setting a Windows security baseline. Windows ships out of the box with a LOT of insecure default settings. Many of these are either for backwards compatibility going all the way to the NT days or to allow for easy networking/communication for very small businesses and home users. These settings rarely make sense in a corporation and represent significant security risks. Baselines aim to make it easy for orgs to lockdown their endpoint security policies by establishing a downloadable and frequently updated list of best practices that can be quickly applied via scripts/GPOs. One big thing to note is that these are not one size fits all solutions. Different baselines are built with different risk tolerances. There is a balance of security vs. potentially breaking things / dramatically impacting workflows. If you decide to look into this be sure to start with test systems and if a baseline severely impacts a system don\u2019t throw the baby out with the bath water.

There are a lot of things that can complicate the costs, which usually comes back to architecture. In a very simple API (front end directly queries DB), the cost in terms of compute will depend on the indexes and organization of your DB, the amount of DB sharding (spread data across active-active servers), and what kind of processing you are doing once the results come back. This type of architecture might drive up costs because you need more powerful DB servers, and a lot more of them, to service a global solution such as Reddit. If they have separate middleware solutions to provide caching and reliability, as most modern apps do, then there is impact there. If said middleware is a distributed cloud solution that you self-rolled, then the costs can become astronomical as that solution auto-scales out. Note: I'm not saying this is right. In reality, if reddit has bad architecture that drives costs up that much, what they should be doing is investing in an overhaul. The problem however, is the same as it is for companies like Microsoft and Windows. In order to truly 'fix' a lot of the issues in Windows, Microsoft would have to start over, which would lose all of their market share (if anyone bothered to try it) because everyone who depends on Windows would have to rewrite everything. Reddit has been around since 2005...there is no doubt tons of legacy code and poor architecture that simply cannot be fixed at this stage without more or less starting over...they might be able to make some incremental gains, but how far they could actually improve things is questionable."}

This approach is going to bring you a lot of pain and if you try to take this approach in a job setting your employer is going to be extremely unhappy. The reason? Powershell is a language riddled with pitfalls. A lot of learning powershell is what not to do and using learning materials and guides are going to point those out so you can recognize the problem fast or spot them in the wild. Additionally, to be a useful scripter there are programming concepts that a person needs to be familiar with. If someone is coming from a background where you've already been introduced to the concepts of scopes, control flow, conditional logic, data types, and maybe more advanced concepts like recursion then that person is already a bit ahead of the game. But if someone is not familiar with these concepts they're going to find themselves stumped quite a bit and learning material does touch on much of these concepts. I can agree that using powershell is a tremendous part of learning it. But trying to dive in without any preparation or a background in scripting/programming is not going to be a good experience at all. Honestly what would be really nice for new learners of powershell is if someone took the time to add to the Exercism track for powershell so that it gets readded to the exercism website: [Exercism course github]( [Exercism]( Unfortunately it was removed due to lack of interest in volunteers to build up the practice exercises. I saw an old bug report mentioning they'd need 10 more added before they'd consider reintegrating it. That would involve forking the git, writing the support documentation in markdown and then writing the pester tests and the initial barebones code for students, and then making some pull requests."}

It's not unique to PowerShell. If you want to learn how to fix computers, don't spend a lot of time reading theory about how computers are supposed to work. Instead, take a broken computer, and learn how to fix it. For any programming language, I'd say that it's good to study up a bit on how to do things and what the best practices are, but you can read whole books on programming languages and do their practice exercises, and still not know how to write in that language. The examples that books give are too neat and easy, crafted to create an example of how the language is supposed to work. At some point, if you really want to know it, you have to use to to solve real problems. Only then will you encounter weird edge cases, issues that the language doesn't handle well, and figure out how to work around the unintuitive and problematic issues of the language. Few books do a good job at contriving examples to show the painful realities you're going to run into."}

At my current job, I'm still learning the ropes, but I've taken a week long report process and automated it into a daily report (it involves a 200+ line SQL query plus some Perl), upgraded our ID deployment process (partly to further improve our reports), created front end tools so I don't need to manually update large lists of data (which would not include real time data - another data point that or team can now use in reporting). There are times I need to be present, but the motivation is to empower people to handle their domains, build tools to help them become self sufficient, and avoid broken shit through maintenance (win-win, because they hate downtime, and the associated ritual of creating tickets that they must wait for to get resolved). So yes, moving towards automation in subtle ways that don't disrupt the environment is optimal. Your first job is to understand your environment, but then you're job becomes tracking the toolkit you've built. And when it's that simple, you can make your exit early."}

Someone new to powershell isn't going to realize that -`LiteralPath` is going to be necessary if you work in an organization and aren't in charge of naming the files. New-Item, Path, Name, and square brackets: After you've become accustomed to `-LiteralPath` some people then go on to realize that `New-Item` doesn't have a `-LiteralPath` parameter but are given a false sense of security when they realize that `-Path` on `New-Item` behaves like `-LiteralPath`. Except, when you use both `-Path` and `-Name` parameters on `New-Item` it goes back to failing on files with square brackets in their name. Pipeline and dynamic collections: One of the first hiccups I remember running into in powershell was a script not behaving as expected but everything seemed to be operating correctly and no messages were given. After investigating I came to realize that a cmdlet was unexpectedly returning an object that went into the pipeline and added into an array further down the script. Switches and enums: When using enums with switches if you try to use something like this code: [Flags()] enum UserProperty { None jobTitle Department Manager = 4 } $test=[UserProperty]::jobTitle switch ($test) { [UserProperty]::Department { write-host \"missed\"} [UserProperty]::jobTitle {write-host \"hit\"} } It won't work. When using enums with switches they have to either not be strongly typed or in parentheses which is unexpected for many people. switch ($test) { Department { write-host \"missed\"} jobTitle {write-host \"hit\"} } or switch ($test) { ([UserProperty]::Department) { write-host \"missed\"} ([UserProperty]::jobTitle) {write-host \"hit\"} } These are some of the problems I've personally experienced but if you look at the powershell github there are also bugs that won't be fixed as they were introduced a long time ago and fixing them would break a lot of code like this bug for the commonly used `+=` operator: [Dynamic variable scope is broken for +=]("}

You *can* do similar with the ISE, but you'd generally do it with a container script and debug that. When debugging, the auto watches do a pretty good job of guessing at what you're interested in, and the call stack is right there for you. You can get most of the same information out of the ISE, but you have to either hover and remember, or set the watches manually. I agree that some of the Intellisense guesses are hopeless and the scope it's finding completions from is probably more broad than I'd like; and I'm still so new to VSCode that I end up accidentally accepting the first suggestion then have to edit--I haven't customized or developed the muscle memory to quickly tell it, 'No.' I'm no VSCode pro, or big proponent of it; I just figured I'd give it a shot after having written a few modules for internal use with the ISE and found the debugging a bit difficult. Between that experience and the direction PowerShell is headed generally, I figured it was time to try VSCode. They're different tools which do different things. The ISE is super lean and straightforward for Windows PowerShell scripting. VSCode is a full blown IDE with all the associated overhead. Many people could probably use the ISE for the rest of their careers without issue, but there may come a time where the greater capabilities and features of VSCode become worth the overhead, and some of the things I'm doing have hit that inflection point. One small example of that, is an extension to rewrap block comments. It saves me a bunch of messing around when editing comment-based help because I tend to edit, format, then read, then edit again, etc. Courses for horses, I say. I'll probably be using both for the next decade (so long as the ISE doesn't get EoLed), just for different sorts of things."}

Write out each step needed to get that step result only. 3. Flow chart/order those steps. 4. Independently/modularly, complete one and only one thing, to ensure you get the expected results. 5. Rinse and repeat. 6. Then put it together. Just like auto manufactures, home builders, etc. 1. The designer/architect of the knows what they want it to look like, 2. the individual parts teams must do their thing by breaking that into pieces, 3. then the assembly teams put it together. Historically, in our industry, we don't think this way. We write a bunch of code, many times assuming, guessing at stuff, then run it, then try to figure out what went wrong; causing ourselves unneeded frustration, debug, etc. efforts; vs catching the stuff upfront. Once all is done, look back at it to see what happened, what can/should be done, what can/shouldbe optimized; as this is what versioning is all about. Sure this effort takes more time upfront, but, it saves way more on the back end as well as long-term care and feeding. ***Don't try to boil the ocean.*** Know that there is not really much that is new. A*nything you may be trying has probably already been tried by someone else.* Learn from their success/failures. ***Know that there is not a legitimate question you can ask, that probably has not already been asked and answered multiple times,*** ***in multiple ways***, ***in multiple locations; in part or holistically.*** You just need to want to research to find it. To do so, you need to really know how to ask your question, and or break it into its parts, or even ask it wrong, knowing/understanding that you may not find it all in one place, but the pieces in many places. Use tools that will write baseline code for you, then tweak/convert as needed. * ***Don't get ahead of yourself.*** * ***Master the built-in help system and its examples.*** * ***Look at similar things/code, etc., already on your system.*** * ***Don't try to reinvent the wheel (unless you absolutely know it's going to be better).*** * ***If you don't know something, don't guess at it, don't assume. Look it up, or go get training.*** * ***Never expect any other platform/language to be like where you came from, what you've used or like. Take the new stuff for what it is.*** This is no different than all our educational efforts. One step at a time.

No one else here is capable of writing scripts but I still comment my code and make it easy to read specifically so I can quickly re-use and improve. Also when I first decided to learn PS I had this batch file that was about 1,000 lines long (and had to be manually updated as we got new PCs). I was able to condense that down to less than 30.

Bradsfoot90 fix your script!!\" It's all tongue in cheek and now a massive running joke in my team. EDIT: Several people have asked so I'll try to put up my script. I'll admit a good chunk of it my script is going to be unique to just my organization. I'll trim some stuff out and post what I have. I've been kinda wanting to make a public repro for my stuff anyways. Check back in a day or so and I will hopefully post a link to it by then! Edit2: Here is a link to my public repo. As I said I cut things down and split things up to make them more useful in most situations. I don't have a homelab to test this on but it should still work without issues.

I started with file moving only. It was a learning curve for PowerShell and I did bork it up once (.NET filesystemwatcher on an ftp directory but I didn't have it so my events were properly unregistered when the script closed). What was the problem? Users reported that their images did show up on the website but not in our access form database backend. The DBA/company programmer killed my script and I started looking into it? Redid the script with proper finally block to clean stuff up and made it just move images, and the error happened again. This time I had logs and I started investigating because it went from 1 to 3 users. What did I discover? In a way it was my script - when PowerShell moved the files they didn't get their permissions updated to match the permissions of the image directory on the server. They were there, but the full access was to administrators and not the everyone group. Why the VB script did this but not PowerShell, I don't know... But it was an old intermittent error. I added copying the permissions to the file after moving and copied the permissions to our over half a million images and it fixed the issue. Well, except there was still an issue. Sometimes in the search for products return report there were products that didn't show an image,but go into the inventory mass entry for the item and the image was there. Again I research but was told \"meh, it's a known problem - most likely due to catching issues in Access.\" A small amount of investigation and I find the answer - *.joeg extensions. The search report has a controller that can render *.jpg but not *.jpeg - so once my image processor is implemented that will go away. Still, to this day if there is any hiccup in the access image rendering or any bad image on our site then it must be my script causing it... even though I haven't made the script process images yet and have repeatedly tried to get feedback on test image quality. I'm sorry, no, the reason that image is crap is because someone uploaded a 100x120 pixel gif/jpg file with transparent background in 2013/2014 and our resizer blows it up to 8x the size (fit into 900x900 pixels) and made the background black. The reason that one is so bad is because I literally manually preprocessed it with GIMP's fuzzy select tool to delete the background and make it white in 30 seconds... Want it better, then process the image better or pay a photographer to get a decent white background photo. Oh, but no, I made a script that moves files and will someday process images, so now every bad image is my fault. As to the sentiment success is rewarded with higher per hour workload expectations? True. Get it done well and your reward is being told to do harder tasks in less time... And you'll be blamed for everything that goes wrong. Oh well, I'm proud I solved the bug in our backend that was plaguing the system for years in a matter of a day or two of investigation."}

Scripting was allowed again within two weeks. > My old job might fall into that category but they had such messed up permissions that I couldn't even do half of what the script does. I've worked on two seperate companies who have these fucked up permissions. One of them gave me a print out with 40+ A3 pages of permissions for folders.

The issue is that this ask is less technical, and far more procedural, and involves manual participation from just about every managerial org there is. And experience in this field tells me that manual participation on anyone's part is a point of failure that's bound to fail sooner or later. Hiring managers need to manually define hiring and start dates. HR needs to manually define a whole litany of HR related items. Facilities needs to provide access to offices, and it needs to be appropriate ... don't want the new temp wandering around the MDF or the new site support guy locked out of the office, do we? Purchasing needs to provide a phone and laptop and whatever else is requested, and the desktop guys need to set it up, and someone - nobody ever knows who - needs to ship it all to the user. Now imagine all of this in reverse for offboarding, which is the logical second half of this ask. But with offboarding, you need to have timing set up perfectly, and a roundabout way to offboard someone immediately if they're let go on poor terms. And all of this is just procedural, we haven't even started taking all that manually entered data and applying it into the right places. We ended up going with Dell Boomi and it took a good 18 months to actually dial in.

I have use regex to strip specials, but will likely switch to your method if it tests out okay. The diacritics are being handled by HR, and they are replacing the charters manually. This involves a human element that can be missed. Sometimes HR misses and the AD admin team has to go in to correct.

I also had to add in SAM conformity so that SAMs are conformed down to 20 characters \\[I can't believe we still are living with this limit\\].

Right now Windows comes bundled with 5.1 so if you want something to run out of the box that's the version you have to target. If they bundled 7.5 with Windows 12 or whatever then that just raises the minimum version you need to worry about to that level. Windows used to do this with every major Windows release (7 came with 2.0. 8 came with 3.0 and so on) they just stopped because of product support policy reasons. I understand the worry about a potential slowdown in the pace of updates but we don't know if that would actually happen (they haven't indicated that in this post at least). If it did happen, I'd say it's still worth it because being stuck on the old .NET framework and C# 7.3 for the inbox version means developers will be less likely to develop something for it. Right now if you are a C# developer that wants to develop a CLI app you have 3 options: 1: Develop a .NET standard 2.0 PowerShell module that is easy to get in the hands of your end users. 2: Develop a new PowerShell module explicitly built for 7.4 that can utilize all the latest .NET and C# features but end users have to install PowerShell 7.4 before installing your module. 3: Build a traditional console app using the latest .NET and C# features and distribute it with WinGet. PowerShell includes a bunch of nice features that saves the developer time in implementation because PowerShell can handle it for them (importing/exporting data in various formats, tab completion, parameter validation, etc.) so a PowerShell module is very appealing option if you know about it. It's just hard to justify working on an ancient version of .NET or making it difficult for users to install your app."}

You can read the reasons that Steve (manager of the PS team) gave here when suggesting a PS7 bootstrapper: Most people that want PowerShell 7 in Windows are not asking for it to replace 5.1. It needs to be a side by side install because of the removed features (though if 7 started shipping with Windows it could be marked for deprecation and removed in a distant future). Regarding the product teams. There's no technical reason why they can't make their modules compatible with both 5.1 and 7. They all end up P/Invoking the various Win32 APIs anyway and they could easily write a .NET standard 2.0 module that does this. I know because I've done it for multiple features already.

Never dealt with them directly before, but I'd heard rumblings from others he was 'difficult' to deal with. The manager who wrote the email also CC'd the IT Group of some thirty people covering HQ and three other offices from the VP of IT down. This resulted in a high-pri ticket with my name on it. This concerned a simple piece of PowerShell code, you type in your email address and the OU site you wanted queried and it sends you the group member list of the AD Groups in that site via email. There's no read me file. The people who need it know how to use it. It's used by the security auditors to make sure the right people in that site are in the right OU's. The scripts are in a group folder that are available to management at the company. When the script is run (It's called \"SiteReview.ps1\"), the prompts show in the PS Window as: **** Site Review v1.02 **** **** In case of issues contact (My name & my email) **** Email: (Pause for input) Site: (Pause for input) The email said that this manager could not get \"any usable output\" from my script then went on to berate me for \"wasting their time\" with \"such unproductive software\". This really surprised me as I had not touched that code in over three years and it was used quarterly by the security auditors. I had built in logging that dumped results into a separate file folder only available to IT so that was my first stop. The first part of the SiteReview.log file was typical, my early tests and past security output ; so I slid down to the more recent time / date stamps. This (edited for readability) is what I found: Email: (Managers email) Site: (XXX site 1) Error message \"Get-ADSite : Directory Object not found...\" Email: (Managers email) Site: site 1) Error message \"Get-ADSite : Directory Object not found...\" Email: (Managers email) Site: site 1) Error message \"Get-ADSite : Directory Object not found...\" Email: (Managers email) Site: www.(XXX site 1) Error message \"Get-ADSite : Directory Object not found...\" (Twenty-two more entries involving four more XXX sites) My boss came up to my desk for an update just as I found the above and one glance raised eyebrows. They asked me to forward the log to their email. Just before closing I was messaged to close the ticket and \"not worry about it.\""}

I had a gut feeling it could have something to do with the DHCP but couldn't be sure because its original IP was free at the time. Turns out a client PC got the exact same IP from the DHCP server shortly before the printer switched to a new one - someone had wisely decided to configure the static IP of the printer in the DHCP range. One final change to its IP and update on the print server later and it never happened again. Dk if that kinda log is enabled by default though but it stored information like device date and time, name, received IP."}

I had been avoiding touching this thing because it was 6k lines. Extremely well documented internally, but basically for each scenario he just popped in the full json to make it happen. So if we wanted something done to a prod environment here's 30 lines of json for prod and next will be the full 30 lines of json for dev. Repeated over and over to handle all our scenarios. All the REST calls with the API itself had been given functions but creating the payloads appears to have been a straight copy paste affair. I picked out the parts of the script that are actually necessary to change for our use case, wrapped everything up in some loops and switches and consolidated it down to 1200 lines. Feed it a list of conditions you want built and the script parses all the info we needed from the list, builds the required json from a few templates, and pumps it through their API. If I need to change something later on all the actionable code is in one place and I don't have 20 sections I'd need to find/replace my change into. I really like the guy I replaced, knew him outside of this job, but he has left behind a legacy of so many crazy long and repetitive scripts that are such a pain to update."}

Had a CS degree from the 80s I think but worked as a sysadmin. A lot of our automated processes ran on his code, whether it was batch, VB, Perl, and I think he even dabbled in C#. When I joined the team I encouraged him to look at Powershell and he went down the road of converting most of \"his\" scripts to PS. I considered him a friend, but his code was actually kinda terrible. Not that it didn't work - it did, usually - but it followed none of the practices Adam discusses here. No functions, no parameters, entire blocks of code copied & pasted into multiple scripts, hardcoded paths... But because he took 'ownership' of these processes nobody held him accountable for years and there was no incentive for him to improve his code. That's a management issue for us, I'm aware, but my point is that good code is a gift to your team and it ultimately benefits the organization. The subject of my story has retired now and I and another new person have the task of untying the knots that he left us. We discovered a problem in a provisioning script, a block copy/pasted from another, that was the root cause of the CEO temporarily losing his security access. Big screw up. We fixed it but the incident showed us just how bad the situation is. I think we who work in IT ops often don't see a need to \"beautify\" our scripts because we have a \"get it done\" mindset. If it works, etc. That's good enough for management. This is also why there's stagnation and resistance to DevOps as a cultural change. My team is a long way from maturity on that journey but I feel that taking pride in creating high quality reusable and robust Powershell is a good place to start. It's my hope that embracing this grassroots shared value of code craftsmanship will take us further down that road, leading to us adopting source control, deploying infrastructure and configuration as code, and adopting other dev practices. None of this depends on management, we will do it ourselves. Maybe I'm too optimistic but it's my intention."}

Because when you move to that other team, you don't have to change any code at all. You simply change a parameter value. You're separating the \"doing\" from the \"invoking\" making code flexible and portable. This. So much this. Any script I make, I try to imagine the multiple use cases I may have with that script. Even for Azure Automation Runbooks, I define the parameters and, usually, apply default values to those parameters. That way I don\u2019t have multiple different variations of a script/runbook. Not to mention, you\u2019ve now got a tool in your toolbox that can with you anywhere. That means it could be shared publicly or to another job. One such script I wrote here recently, is a bit tailor made to my work environment; however, I\u2019ve tooled it in a way that it gives me flexibility in how it\u2019s used. For example I need a Windows Server VM spun up in Azure, but I don\u2019t want to constantly go through the process of running multiple different commands from the Az modules. The server needs to be in a particular subnet for a virtual network and applied a specific DSC config, so I just get the returned output from the respective commands to get that information and supply it to the respective parameter for my script.

I'm not sure I'm 100% on what you're saying, but if it could join all objects into an array with each property of the different objects being a different property across all of them, and then filtering it down to only shared (or shared by X number) properties, you'd be able to do some pretty neat stuff from my point of view. Pretty niche, but I've been in a position where it would have helped me instead of having to manually look at each object to determine what they share. Issue would be doing similar ones such as \"name\" and \"firstname\" being the same, but different properties. Idk, just fun to think about."}

I fought for the last two days with no sleep with this computer and I\u2019ve tried multiple actually hundreds of different options to try to fix it and nothing works.

Some people haven't been able to play for a month because they did something *absolutely wacky* like alter the timing of `sleep()` interrupts or some optimization bullshit like that. Some people have had to go as far as installing entirely fresh copies of Windows just to play, likely because they ran some stupid debloat script six years ago and don't even remember doing it, and now some tiny portion of the OS deviates from expected norms and breaks the (arguably cheap) anti-cheat software. You don't want to find out six years from now that you can't play Hot New Game 7 and you can't figure out why, and it's because of some weird debloating or optimization script you ran today."}

In my opinion, the point of a windows reset isn't even because I would worry about something malicious or a back door. More like something unnecessary like a process monitor tool or a defrag scheduled task or something eating up resources. Windows reset is very easy and will give you a clean enough slate to start from. Installing truly from scratch isn't rocket science either, but it's going to require more time, a second windows computer, and a decent usb stick. I think if OP already knew how to do all that they wouldn't be here asking."}

As for who would use it, people that like to save time or that like to use tools from github repositories in general. For example, ai like to use zsh in Linux with \"powershell 10k\" that has a similar amount of reading if not more involved with understanding how to set it up and use it if not more. It is pretty common especially amongst those that fo dev work to share projects like this. I'm always appreciative of the our dev community and folks sharing projects. Hoped that helps you understand a bit at least regardless of whether you choose to run whatever in general."}

Why don\u2019t you try to do this it\u2019s like dude I I\u2019d rather go with somebody who has a degree certificate, and license to do this properly Which kind of upset them but there\u2019s no way I\u2019d be getting my money back because he says he spent my money to upgrade the 3080 to a 4070 and custom Waterloo. I mean it took three months for him to even build it which took him two days to build it by the way, and mail it out to me And I just I\u2019m just mentally drained by this point I mean the GPU still works the CPU works properly. I think it may just be a motherboard and PSU issue but if you\u2019d like, I can let you know what the repair guy says it\u2019s it\u2019s a person that I\u2019ve gone to before for my old computer and they don\u2019t charge you to run diagnostic on it. They don\u2019t overcharge you for parts since they get the parts straight from the manufacturer for cheap, so I trust them to handle this and like I said if you\u2019d like, I can keep you updated on what they say is going on with it also yes it\u2019s safe to say that I don\u2019t really talk to this guy anymore in my buddy who recommended him basically said he\u2019s never gonna talk to him again because he screwed me over like that I can hope that maybe the people at the repair shop will let me make payments overtime because I basically spent my entire savings for the entire day of last year on this computer I mean it was $1200 but I only make $400 every two weeks because every job in my town is part time at the moment so it was like the most money I\u2019ve ever spent it\u2019s just kinda had me bummed out that it was wasted. I know everybody says that you should have gone on a trusted website but my friend trusted him heavily and I trusted the guy heavily too I just didn\u2019t realize how stupid it was at the time, sorry it\u2019s a long message but thank you for reading it if you read it all the way appreciate you"}

Everyone in the company who has supports any kind of IT system has to fill in the document that includes this table, we've got about 4700 of them. My colleague has gone through every one of those documents and manually copied the table contents out and into his spreadsheet. He's been doing it for 10 months. 10. Not full time of course but still... These documents get recertified every year so some of them are certainly already out of date and it will all be in the next year. It was discussed how we'd review that data again given the enormous labour cost of doing it(!?). You all know how this goes seeing as I'm posting here. By the end of the 25 minute meeting I had 20 lines of PS that extracted the relevant table into a csv file for a single document and by the end of the day I could loop through the entire 4700 documents in about an hour and have the data in an excel document. There was some entertaining issues with identical text strings not matching (format-hex is your friend, as is .split(\"`r\")[0]) and some of the older documents not matching the newer revision but it was working. Not an enormous one for sure but first time I've saved *so much* time with a simple script"}

It wasted his entire day and made a long-time client distrust our team. Worse, I was a dick about it the entire time, because a senior engineer shouldn't have any trouble running a pwsh script, lol, git gud, works on my machine. So. I rewrite it, still doesn't run. Another rewrite, I just change all the error/verbose output to log writes and ask for the log file. The errors are all user permissions -- the test user didn't have write access to the file share where the PDFs are. Sensible chuckle.

But when it comes to explaining things and data requiring a lot of words and technical information a word processor program is what you need. And a document is perfect for word processor programs.

Used to work in a call centre (many clients). My team was working with lost baggage tracing. We primarily worked for a particular handler in some airports (they served more airports and there are different handlers). We also served for a specific airline for secondary (between 5 days and 28 days of it being lost) tracing. You do tracing by looking at a report of a lost bag, the description, flight info and the contents inside of the bag (if passenger agrees to provide that info). The tool used was basically a terminal and an oldshool at that, where there were set rows and columns. You would input the command to list all reports for the airline in one of their airpots, and go all over them and check potential matches, message airports for additional details if a match was a decent chance. You can imagine, for 90+ airports one file at a time takes a while. The average time to get a single pass through was \\~2.5 hours and someone had to do it at least twice a day. Most of the time was actually to check all the airports to find the reports, there were actually not that many missing bags for that long. Well, that terminal apparently had it's own scripting language... I sat down, learned how to have it cycle through all the airports of the airline, for a date range you input before starting and just copy out all the reports into a text file. That was the script bit. Then I sat down and made a procedure \u2014 you run the script the first time for the date range of all the secondary tracing. Get all the reports and put them in a spreadsheet and note down when you ran the script. The idea is that the next day, you don't need the whole range again, you just need for the one day that is now bags missing for 6 days. If a day was missed for whatever reason (low priority job) a formula would show you which days you need to give the script to find all missing reports and add those to the spreadsheet. Then in the spreadsheet you'd just note the last status update. All in all I was able to perform the task in \\~15 minutes and I would put in 2.5 hours of work. I would either sit that time and read a book if there were no calls or my efficiency (how much of my time was spent performing tasks) was well over 100% (which was not impossible if you multitask during calls)... Shared this procedure with the rest of the team and heard it was in use long after I left up to the point the terminal tool was shut down and they started moving a web interface tool."}

We had a teamlead that did a lot of work manually and when she pensioned off I looked at some of those tasks (creating users, e-mailing managers with cost specifications) and thought I could spend the next 3 months automating it. The user creation was pretty easy, it resulted in a series of questions that resulted in a fully provisioned user and was waiting for automation using integration with out HR system. Additional benefit was that the naming convention was enforced since my new colleague did what he thought was OK rather than asking what the convention was when in doubt. The cost specification was a bit harder because the vendor changed the downloadable csv every few months. But, I asked my manager why IT was responsible for sending out cost specifications to a contract that was basically all-inclusive with minor variances (paid service calls, foreingn usage on holiday etc). There was also a GDPR question because private use was allowed. The result there was that it got offloaded to the individual managers, if there was probable cause we could look at the costs and output that to the manager in question."}

The blog is free, it has no ads, it doesn't cost anything except my time to prepare it and money to host it. Summary blog posts with description/screenshots and links to sources: [ Here's a list of +-40 PowerShell Modules I've created over the last 2 years. There are modules that provide a full spectrum of options for anyone interested: * Active Directory Functions * Word creating/reading * PDF creating/split/merge * HTML creating without zero HTML/CSS/js knowledge * HTML parsing * RSS * SIEM, Event Logs * Microsoft Teams * Discord * Lansweeper And many others. As PowerShell is no longer Windows only some of those modules work just fine on Linux and macOS. Usually, PowerShell 5.1, PowerShell 6 and PowerShell 7 are supported if the underlying .NET provides that option. All those modules are free, fully open source. * In 2018 I've written 21 of them * In 2019 another 20 In 2020 I plan to reduce the number of modules integrating some of the stuff together, however, it's possible new ones will be born. &#x200B; |Name|GitHub Stars|Download CountTotal|Download CountLast|Releases|Releases (2020)|Releases (2019)| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |[ADEssentials]( |[Connectimo]( |[Dashimo]( |[Documentimo]( |[Emailimo]( |[Excelimo]( |[Graphimo]( |[LittleInfrastructureManager]( |[PesterInfrastructureTests]( |[PSAutomator]( |[PSBlackListChecker]( |[PSDiscord]( |[PSEventViewer]( |[PSFreshService]( |[PSLansweeper]( |[PSManageService]( |[PSMyPassword]( |[PSParseHTML]( |[PSPasswordExpiryNotifications]( |[PSPublishModule]( |[PSPulsewayManager]( |[PSSharedGoods]( |[PSTeams]( |[PSUnifi]( |[PSWebToolbox]( |[PSWinDocumentation]( |[PSWinDocumentation.AD]( |[PSWinDocumentation.AWS]( |[PSWinDocumentation.AzureHealthService]( |[PSWinDocumentation.DNS]( |[PSWinDocumentation.O365]( |[PSWinDocumentation.O365HealthService]( |[PSWinReporting]( |[PSWinReportingV2]( |[PSWriteColor]( |[PSWriteExcel]( |[PSWriteHTML]( |[PSWritePDF]( |[PSWriteWord]( |[Statusimo]( |[Testimo]( &#x200B; As I don't have too much place here to provide a full overview of it here I do encourage you to visit blog post I wrote that covers in the summary which module does what and how you can use it.

I've started my first ever module by reading an article by psCookieMonster [ I've been using this approach ever since but with few changes. 1. I create public/private/lib/resources and other folders as needed - it's easier to manage 50 lines of code, easier to search, easier to collaborate on Github 2. I've written PowerShell module PSPublishModule which merges all files from public/private into single psm1 file (why? [ 3. The same module takes anything in the Public folder and exports all function names and aliases and puts them into .psm1 to Export command and also into PSD1 command. This is best-performance wise as per PowerShell Best Practice. This also prevents users from using Private, non-exposed functions. It means I can have 50 functions in a module and only 1 being public. 4. The same module is also merging some dependencies into single psm1 file This allows me to have a single PSM1 that is optimized/formated with only aliases/function names exported from the public folder. The PSPublishModule does some weird tricks that are a bit special for my needs so not sure if it would be useful for anyone else but what it does it: 1. You make your development in a folder like C:\\\\Github<YourProject> 2. When you run the tool it links files it needs from folders Private/Public/Resources into TEMP directory and then proceeds with merging and creating everything. This means only \"critical\" stuff is copied into the final module folder. This means you can have other folders in the project folders such as Examples/Docs/Ignore or any other folder and all that is skipped except some native stuff. 3. Finally, it copies it to PowerShell module folders for \"optimal use\". 4. It can also publish modules directly and it uses that \"optimized\" version without all that junk you have in development. 5. It updates PSD1 for you. It controls version for you (you just manage single ps1 hash - here's an example for Testimo - [ I just run this .ps1 every time I want to build it for release and it does its magic. But like I said, it's a bit hacky hack as I add features that I need. Never described how it actually works and not sure it will work for anyone else without some hardening. The cool feature that I added lately is that you can provide some \"approved\" modules such as PSSharedGoods/PSWriteColor into it and if your module uses them it can copy needed functions from those modules and integrate it into your final publish. It can also show you during the build if any of the commands are potentially used, but not mentioned in the required modules. Probably sometime in 2020 I'll update it, make it more error-proof and release. You can see what it does to where here (it's described a bit here - [ ) - I tried attaching img here but it was hanging Reddit."}

Its certainly got a pretty impressive set of features. The real issue is that its not portable.

You can also replace bash with sh in a lot of cases and get even more platform compatibility. The only place where PowerShell is relevant is Windows and other MS-based non-Linux platforms, which are the minority. If PowerShell was available by default on all these systems, the conversation would be very different. There's plenty of other softwares out there which are also great, but if they are not standard across platforms like bash / sh, then its gonna be a tough sell to convince people to use them, especially for something like a shell which ideally should just come by default with your OS."}

Now I weirdly prefer the challenge of getting things to work with powershell including using makefiles just because I can. So yeah I think PowerShell could of took off had it been more talked about or known about what you can do with it. Also large barrier to enter is the fact you are permission locked from even enabling a profile. While on gnu/linux configure your rc how you please. So I legit think people think just don't know much about it or why you would use it."}

But with just a bit of customization, you can get _almost_ the same functionality. You're right that sorting by Directory is incorrect; `Attributes` is an enumeration, which translates to bit flags, so it won't sort the way we want. I believe PSIsContainer is what we want, but it has to be sorted in reverse if we want to get the same behavior as `DIRCMD=/ogen`. Here's my new and improved version: `dir | sort Extension,Name | sort PSIsContainer -Descending -Stable` If you're OK with directories displayed last, it's a bit simpler: `dir | sort PSIsContainer,Extension,Name` The function also limits the `dir` command, so defining a filter is infinitely more flexible. (It's not actually that the filter is better than a function, but piping output to it is more flexible than making it a function, which would have to handle splatting parameters to `dir` for it to really be useful). `filter mysort { $_ | sort Extension,Name | sort PSIsContainer -Descending -Stable }` Now we can do all sorts of things with it: ``` dir | mysort dir .\\subdir\\ | mysort dir | where lastwritetime -gt '1/1/2023' | mysort ```"}

I was expecting you to talk about the Group-Object cmdlet, but what you actually cover is a feature added in v3 called automatic member enumeration As a footnote, I think covering automatic variables in general would be beneficial since it seems so few people know about them: [ \\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- /u/empty_other **If you only have a simple query, you dont need the brackets or the $\\_.:** gci C:\\ | ? { $_.name -like \"program*\" } gci C:\\ | ? name -like \"program*\""}

I would see things like this used often when I was looking up how to do stuff and it was almost never explained why. If I had taken a proper Powershell/scripting course I would likely know these things. That said myself, and many other I am sure, didn't have the time to do a full basics course and knew enough about it to piece things together until they worked. Hell I still haven't done any proper Powershell courses, but I am leaps and bounds ahead of where I was 1-2 years ago when I first had to patch a script together."}

My latest script can potentially free up quite a few TB of lost/forgotten storage space if I can get some people to take notice. In a nutshell it grabs the homeDirectory attribute from every user in our AD (our organization has just over 105k user accounts around the world) and throws them into an array. Then it grabs the path to whatever directory you feed it (our home directories *should* be geographically close to the user) and it checks every path in the folder against the array, if the path doesn't belong to any AD object it moves it to a folder to be deleted later. I could check it against just our OU but sometimes when people move and have their account moved they only think to have their ad object is moved and they will forget to move their data. At the site I sit at it saved freed ~500GB (I know, storage is cheap but there are a few hundred other sites). I've thought about also having it compare the OU to the file path and notify me about irregularities but I don't have the motivation sometimes... not trying to complain but kinda a put off when the most interesting thing you do during the day isn't even your job! haha"}

No, no it shouldn't be. PS Remoting is about constrained endpoints with restricted language modes, serialising .Net data over XML, with logging and group policy control. PS Remoting is about proxy commands and JEA and restricted language modes. When you connect to a PowerShell endpoint, it can give you a limited number of commands and a restricted set of parameters that you can use with them. SSH is about being a network swiss-army-knife-slash-vpn for running TUI programs over and sending completely arbitrary strings back and forth. That's just like saying \"Windows should have the firewall and UAC off by default so Linux users are more comfortable\". Or \"Windows should use VNC instead of RDP\". A terrible backwards step. And having PS Remoting over SSH without any of SSH's other features, if all it is is transport over port 22 instead of port 443, that negates any point of it. > I'm also not a fan of the verbosity of the commands, awk, sed, etc are much easier for an interactive shell then powershell's alternatives. PowerShell's functions are very `awk` inspired, with their BEGIN{} PROCESS{} END{}, and combined with `| select -first 1 -skip 3` and `-replace` they can get close to the shortness. But what they pay for in size, they gain by being one language instead of sed-script and awk-language in shell-script triple-language with grep and two or three flavours of regex between them. > I see powershell as a good scripting language Ehhhhh, maybe."}

Exactly. There's a reason my regex skills are shit and it's not because I don't script enough. It's because I so rarely need to deal with parsing strings. And yes I agree with the guy above that PS performance does suck at parsing strings and text and yeah even file handling with get-childitem and such. But the reason is if I'm wrangling with strings and parsing text I'm probably doing something very wrong to begin with. I don't think I could in a Reddit post really bring a Linux guy to understand the difference. Linux is ALL text files and parsing text. I mean if you want to display the running services and you do the linux equivalent of Get-Service you don't get objects back you get text. Tab delimited. And the command might be different and the columns too maybe depending on the OS and if systemd and so on and so forth. I can't even imagine going back to dealing with that stuff. Like the Linux equivalent of: Get-Service -cn (Server1,Server2) | ?{$_.StartType -eq \"Automatic\" -and $_.status -ne \"running\"} | Start-Service Would be if not ridiculously long, relying on management tools and the whims of various tools not written with similar structure in mind. I would imagine a long time Linux guy would try to actually parse the text out of the objects and then pass it into a for each loop with a fully formed command instead of properly utilizing the objects. I mean it's probably a bad example I've used. I'm sure there's clever methods for dealing with services because it's such a common thing but you get my point. It's as hard for me to shift my mindset back to dealing with text as it must be for them to stop thinking about dealing with output as text."}

I'm not *unfairly* prejudiced against Linux, nor against it unreasoningly. I'm *fair*-ly opinionated against it based on experience and reasoning. Linux grows on a \"short term convenience trumps everything\" approach. No need to get a purchase order signed off? Can pretend software license rights and restrictions don't exist? Can spin up an entire DR and Dev and Testing environment with no extra licenses? Can run it on a router with no license fee? Can download and install stuff without even having to care what it is or where it came from? Perfect! When Linux costs money, people won't pay for it. That's been proven over and over with attempted commercial distributions. Linux is not *good*, Linux is *free* and *free* is good. People conflate the two. > If you want to speak Esperanto because the language is more pure & intentionally designed, that's fine, but you have to teach everyone else the language first or it's value will be extremely limited. La Esperanto ekzistas por komunikado; tiu afero bezonas multajn homojn, Linukso ne estas kaj ne bezonas tiun. The value of a language increases proportionally to the number of people who speak it. The value of an operating system is not related to the number of people who use it. It could have only a single company using it and still be worth billions. If there is a person in Korea who speaks Esperanto, you might be able to speak to them. If there is a person in Korea who runs Linux, it will have no effect on your life. You also don't have to teach *everyone* to speak Esperanto, if there's more than sayyyy 50 speakers you can personally talk to, and 10 speakers you like, that's probably enough for it to be valuable to you. And you certainly don't go around \"teaching people Esperanto\" in a colonial force-push sense and whining that you can't talk to people who speak Spanish and trying to mandate that they therefore mustn't speak Spanish and must meet you at your level only. If you want to talk to them, *you learn Spanish*. From the other side you can only show that the regular word endings make pattern recognition and memory so much easier for learning and working in a second language, and that regular pronounciation and spelling makes it easier to read, write, understand and be understood, and see if people will take things on their merits or not. > It's not about 'dragging windows down to our level' its about portability of your solution, plain & simple. Something I don't support outright. Portability comes at a cost. What you're saying is \"nobody should be allowed to do better\". What you're saying is \"you shouldn't be allowed to make a boat, because it won't drive on the roads\". What you're saying is \"Linux can't compete by being desirable, so the competitors must stop being desirable so it looks as good as they do\". Or, to put it another way, Oracle is portable between Windows and Linux and I still don't want to use Oracle. Sticking to one platform lets you play to the strengths of that platform, and compensate for the weaknesses of that platform. Supporting all platforms lets you play to the strengths of *nothing*, and makes you compensate for the *combined weaknesses of all platforms*. This is an obvious bad pattern. It should be plain and clear that this is harder *and* results in a worse outcome.

Microsoft's anti-competitive practises of the 1990s are not what I'm defending, here. Linux is not \"gunning for Windows\", Linux is making roughly zero effort to gain the things that Windows has, it's instead relying on Linux being free and Microsoft making Windows worse and worse while moving their cash-cows to web browsers, until Windows falls below an acceptable standard. And we will all be the worse when that happens, in the same way we all lost out when Windows Phone and FireFox OS and HP WebOS and Nokia Maemo and Jolla Sailfish and Blackberry all collapsed down to just Android. > Thankfully MS have wised up & started offering comparable features, what I'm asking for is just one of them. SSH may NOT be the correct solution, but parity between OSes for powershell needs to happen sooner rather than later. Powershell should not go cross platform, it should be shipped with Windows, and I don't opine about whether it stays Open Source or not. Powershell development should be incentivised to be so good that Linux people crave Windows just to use it, rather than being \"Microsoft is trying to force this ill-matched language on Linux lol FOAD\". The same way people buy macOS just so they can develop for iPhone. Microsoft used to be better at this than they are now. Isn't competition supposed to be a *good* thing?"}

At this point it's good to hear that they've seen the obvious light, and they should bring it back to native integration ASAP. Slow Windows adoption was likely expected. They switched to a new .NET runtime and focused on making the cross platform experience better. There wasn't much new for Windows PowerShell users, and there was a decent compatibility gap. They weren't standing around wondering where all the Windows users went, they were waiting on .NET Core 3.0 to bridge the gap. The only real alternative path they could have gone was to delay going cross platform and Core, and *maybe* released one more FullCLR version. A version that most folks wouldn't have upgraded to anyway."}

Then it copies their on-prem directory to a folder on their OneDrive. Then a few extra scripts beyond that to turn their home directory to a read-only folder so they don't keep adding items to it, we're providing education to users to start using their OneDrive instead, and a final script to be run at a later date which finds the user in AD and just removes the homeDirectory attribute entirely (shutting off their access to it / not mapping it any longer). I ran into a lot of issues that I hadn't considered even though I had heard of them before, but I ended up having to do a lot of extra work to add things like batching the API calls; automatically refreshing the token which only lasts for 1 hour, and handling various HTTP errors I was running into on the v1 version of the script. All in all, the script works really well now after lots of testing and debugging, but in the end it looks like we're just going to purchase ShareGate anyway, which is fine since I had a lot of fun writing this script out and using it to prove to management why we should purchase ShareGate, and I learned a lot. It's still kind of funny though that I could spend a whole week devising the perfect OneDrive script only to end up at \"and this is why we should purchase the enterprise grade software which does this same thing for us because theirs is just that little bit better\"."}

Source was a farm of eight main site collections, with ~750 webs and further sub-webs at varying nesting level, to a total of about 1k webs. Every web and sub-web had one or two document libraries, and each of those had one of the few possible folder sets based on some criteria. Around 700 GB of data. Target was a streamlined structure where every web would become its own site (all following the agreed template), while every sub-web would become a document library in that site. Every library had a specific set of folders based on whether that library was matched to a sub-web or the content from main web. There was also an additional library for data coming from very specific folders in source. The data mapping was a mix of one-to-many, many-to-one, and one-to-one. A source web and all of its sub-webs had to have its confidential data identified and migrated into a separate library in target site following specified paths. Data from libraries in sub-webs and the main web had to be split into specific target folders. Only some scenarios had a simple 'mirror source library into target library'. Whatever folders didn't fall under any set rules were migrated into a 'General' location, but these had to be filtered too. All of SharePoint 2013 PowerShell, ShareGate Shell, and PnP.Shell were used. Four functions and eight scripts in total, along with however many ad-hoc scriptlets. Everything was handled with PowerShell: creation of new sites, deploying of the site template, creating additional target libraries and folders, migrating data following agreed rules, verifying that all data has successfully migrated, as well as progress tracking and setting up new streamlined permission structure. It was both more challenging and easier than i expected when starting out. It would easily take 10x longer without PowerShell."}

You are complaining about the complexity of doing it in PowerShell vs using CMD to use a command line utility, without having access to or looking at the complexity of the repadmin source code! The PowerShell function you shared is directly using .NET Framework classes from the System.DirectoryServices.ActiveDirectory namespace to interact with Active Directory replication. So it's .NET code being used within a PowerShell function. You may type a simple command when using repadmin, but internally it could be thousands of lines of code making low-level Win32 or WMI API calls, handling errors, and formatting output. The complexity is abstracted away because the exe is a compiled tool that Microsoft provides to aide in maintaining and troubleshooting replication, it is not a scripting language. So, complaining that PowerShell is \u201ctoo verbose\" to reproduce repadmin functionality is kinda like complaining that: \u201cBuilding a car from parts (then driving it) is harder than just driving a car.\u201d If the right person at Microsoft decides it's useful and necessary to be able to do equivalent repadmin tasks in PowerShell, then they would likely write and release a cmdlet that has that functionality... and whatever level of complexity that is required to achieve that same functionality would be abstracted away in the similar way that is with repadmin.exe."}

Background: I have been using a PS automation to email weekly sales numbers to me broken down into percentages for things I need. I got a new office pc this weekend. It's just a basic office pc, nothing fancy, but easily 15x faster than my previous pc. I don't know if this could cause issues. My Ps script is working until it gets to the point of pulling Net Sales numbers. It stopped sending the correct numbers to notepad file that emails. It is still rewriting the file but with $0.00 instead of the actual sales numbers. It looks like it's happening so fast it's not giving the pc time to pull the numbers. I have a 10 second wait setup for this bc the website I pull from is not the fastest and this has always worked so I'm not sure what the issue could be."}

The next version of this module will have the ability to search using advanced criteria like getting all scripts, tagged with Entra ID, with the keyword logins. That type of stuff. Or as is right now, you can use PowerShell filtering to look something up. I'm sure could do that in the browser if I had better WordPress skills, but I spent all my skill points on dotnet."}

I have a hash table and am trying to retrieve a single Value by inputting the values Key (or Name). (This is only a small table rn for testing but will apply to a large table in the future.) I can use the dot delimiter (ex. $Hash.MyKey1) to retrieve my first value \"Value 1\" however any other key does not work... For example if I use $Hash.MyKey2 i just get a blank new line. I used { Select-Object -InputObject $Hash -Property \\* } after each iteration of my loop that grabs from a .csv file and inputs into the hash table. And after each iteration the hash table's Keys and Values properties change accordingly (i.e. the loop is working properly). And when i just output the entire hash to the console it shows all Keys and Values correctly correlated. I used $Hash.ContainsKey('MyKey') and $Hash.ContainsValue('MyValue') for each of the keys and values in the entire table and they all came back true. They just arn't being outputted when I call for them.... Any explanations on where I am going wrong? Code: $CSVPath = \"\\\\SecretSecret\\NoLooky\\homework\" $Hash = @{} Import-Csv -LiteralPath $CSVPath | Select-Object -Property Property1, Property2 | ForEach-Object { $Hash.Add(($_.Property1), ($_.Property2)) } $Hash \"-----------------------------\" $Hash.MyKey1 \"----------------------\" $Hash.MyKey2 \"-----------------------\" Output: Name Value \\---- ----- Key 2 Value 2 Key 4 Value 4 Key 5 Value 5 Key 1 Value 1 Key 3 Value 3 \\----------------------------- Value 1 \\---------------------- \\----------------------- I changed the names of the Keys and the Values for the sake of the example but I hope you get the isea here lol Appreciate any insight into this!"}

As part of that process, we copy the SQL backup files from a UNC path to the VM where they will be restored, and I don't have control over the names of the folders users create. This works fine as long as the path doesn't contain spaces. I've been able to find ways to deal with those everywhere except when we call robocopy to copy the backups. $StagingDatabaseContainer is the UNC path to the folder that contains the backups. That is populated by reading an argument passed to this Powershell script, and that argument is always surrounded with single quotes (this solved *almost* all of our problems). I've gone through a bunch of iterations of calling robocopy -- some of them rather ridiculous -- but the spaces always get passed as-is, causing robocopy to see the path as multiple arguments. Some of the approaches I've tried: & 'C:\\Windows\\System32\\Robocopy.exe' $StagingDatabaseContainer C:\\dbbackup\\ *.bak /np /r:3 /w:60 /log+:c:\\temp\\robocopy_dbs.log & 'C:\\Windows\\System32\\Robocopy.exe' \"'${StagingDatabaseContainer}'\" C:\\dbbackup\\ *.bak /np /r:3 /w:60 /log+:c:\\temp\\robocopy_dbs.log Start-Process -FilePath 'C:\\Windows\\System32\\Robocopy.exe' -ArgumentList \"${StagingDatabaseContainer}\",'C:\\dbbackup\\','*.bak','/np','/r:3','/w:60','/log+:c:\\temp\\robocopy_dbs.log' -Wait -NoNewWindow Start-Process -FilePath 'C:\\Windows\\System32\\Robocopy.exe' -ArgumentList @($StagingDatabaseContainer,'C:\\dbbackup\\','*.bak','/np','/r:3','/w:60','/log+:c:\\temp\\robocopy_dbs.log') -Wait -NoNewWindow Start-Process -FilePath 'C:\\Windows\\System32\\Robocopy.exe' -ArgumentList \"`\"${StagingDatabaseContainer}`\"\",'C:\\dbbackup\\','*.bak','/np','/r:3','/w:60','/log+:c:\\temp\\robocopy_dbs.log' -Wait -NoNewWindow & 'C:\\Windows\\System32\\Robocopy.exe' ($StagingDatabaseContainer -replace '([ ()]) ','`$1') C:\\dbbackup\\ *.bak /np /r:3 /w:60 /log+:c:\\temp\\robocopy_dbs.log I also looked into using `Resolve-Path -LiteralPath` to set the value of $StagingDatabaseContainer, but since it's being passed to robocopy, I still have to turn it back into a string and I end up in the same place. Anyone know the way out of this maze? Thanks in advance. # SOLUTION My UNC path comes with a trailing backslash. Once I did a TrimEnd('\\\\'), it was golden.

You can simply supply it with the list of arguments as a string or even a collection and it will figure it all out. Once it's all set, you call $Process.Start() and then monitor HasExited property for status. There is also an exit code property and you can redirect the output if needed.

This means there's no closing `\"`, resulting in only a single parsed argument. Without the escaped `\"`, the arguments are parsed correctly: raw: [\"robocopy.exe\" \"\\\\Server\\Share\\Foo Bar\" C:\\dbbackup *.bak /np /r:3 /w:60 /log+:c:\\temp\\robocopy_dbs.log] arg #0: [\\\\Server\\Share\\Foo Bar] arg #1: [C:\\dbbackup] arg #2: [*.bak] arg #3: [/np] arg #4: [/r:3] arg #5: [/w:60] arg #6: [/log+:c:\\temp\\robocopy_dbs.log] Another solution is to escape the trailing `\\` yourself (PowerShell v7+ does this quietly when `$PSNativeCommandArgumentPassing` is set to `Windows`). $StagingDatabaseContainer = '\\\\Server\\Share\\Foo Bar\\\\' However, removing it entirely is still the more robust solution."}

Long time lurker here. I work as kind of a sysadmin for a medium sized corp in Europe. I have been tasked with creating a system to help us see how many VM's have we, where they are used, if they have been backed up, if they have monitoring agent etc. The script taps into the API of vmware to extract name of the vm, UUID and description and then fetches computer-objects from AD and compares hostnames (it also gets OS information from AD). After that it adds on more information from salt and check-mk's API. This is my first time creating a script this complex and it has been a process of learning by doing helped by Microsoft docs and ChatGPT so bear with me in the spaghetti. The script is ran in 4 different environments via Ansible daily and the data is consolidated and compared with yesterday's version to see if a VM is running or have been deleted. The script have now been running for a couple of months and creates a beautiful .csv-file which i can load into our asset-database. There are however some problems i cant figure out that would like some help solving. 1. If the script detects that a VM has a state of \"powered off\" it should put a timestamp on that vm's object with todays date. The next time the script is ran it checks the timestamp is more than 14 days in the past, and if yes - it sets the VMs state to \"inoperative\". The problem is that the script not always interprets the timestamp in a correct way and will just overwrite with a new timestamp OR when the timestamp has passed 14 days, it will overwrite with today's timestamp. I have tried so many different variants of timestamping and formats but none of them seems to be working. I suspect this has something to do with the fact that the timestamp is exported as a .csv and then imported back in, but everything i have tried either works for a couple of days or does not work at all. Here is the code I'm currently using to set the timestamp and read it back in: &#8203; foreach ($newRow in $newestFile) { $existingRow = $null if ($newRow.UUID) { $matchingUUIDs = $latestData | Where-Object { $_.UUID -eq $newRow.UUID } if ($matchingUUIDs.Count -eq 1) { $existingRow = $matchingUUIDs[0] } } if (-not $existingRow -and $newRow.Hostname) { $existingRow = $latestData | Where-Object { $_.Hostname -eq $newRow.Hostname } } if ($existingRow) { if ($existingrow.Timestamp -and $existingrow.Timestamp -ne $null){ try { $timetest = [datetime]::ParseExact($existingrow.Timestamp, \"dd.MM.YYYY HH:mm:ss\", $null) } catch { Write-Host \"Failed to parse timestamp for host: $($existingrow.Hostname) - Setting timestamp to current date.\" $existingrow.Timestamp = $currentDate } } else { $timetest = $null } if ($existingrow.State -eq \"inoperative\" -and $existingrow.Hostname -ne $exceptions) { if (-not $existingrow.PSObject.Properties[\"Timestamp\"]) { $existingrow | Add-Member -MemberType NoteProperty -Name 'Timestamp' -Value $currentdate $success += ($existingrow.Hostname + \"`r`n\") } if ($existingrow.Timestamp -eq '') { $existingrow.Timestamp = $currentDate $success += ($existingrow.Hostname + \"`r`n\") } if ($timetest -ne $null) { if ($timetest -lt $priorDate) { $existingrow.State = \"scrapped\" $success += ($existingrow.Hostname + \"`r`n\") } } } elseif ($existingrow.State -eq \"In operation\") { if ($existingrow.PSObject.Properties[\"Timestamp\"]) { $existingrow.Timestamp = $null } } elseif ($existingrow.State -eq \"System.Object[]\") { $existingRow.State = $newRow.State } $updatedData += [PSCustomObject]@{ Hostname = $newRow.Hostname OS = $newRow.OS Version = $newRow.Version OS_Family = $newRow.OS_family IPv4 = $newRow.IPv4 Domain = $newRow.Domain State = $existingrow.State UUID = $newRow.UUID VMHost = $newRow.VMHost Notes = $newRow.Notes virtual_machine = $newRow.virtual_machine Timestamp = $existingrow.Timestamp Checkmk_agent = $newrow.Checkmk_agent } } else { $updatedData += $newRow } } 2. The second problem is the output files of the script. There should always be two output files, one file which is the data from today and one file which is the \"master\" where the data from today has been compared to that from yesterday. The master-file is the one that is compared and sent over to be consolidated with those from the other environments. Sometimes, but not always, maybe a couple of times per month the script does NOT create the master-file. I cannot figure out why. The output-code is inside a try/catch and that too reports no error.

Timestamp problem** In your `ParseExact`, you\u2019re using `\"dd.MM.YYYY HH:mm:ss\"`. The `\"YYYY\"` is the *week year* in .NET formatting, not the calendar year \u2013 that\u2019s why it sometimes behaves strangely or keeps overwriting. Switch it to lowercase `yyyy` instead: $timetest = [datetime]::ParseExact($existingrow.Timestamp, \"dd.MM.yyyy HH:mm:ss\", [System.Globalization.CultureInfo]::InvariantCulture) Also, when you generate the timestamp, make sure you format it consistently with the same culture/format: $currentDate = (Get-Date).ToString(\"dd.MM.yyyy HH:mm:ss\", [System.Globalization.CultureInfo]::InvariantCulture) That way your export \u2192 import \u2192 compare cycle stays stable. **2. Master file not being created** That usually happens when `$newestFile` is empty or `$filename_latest` doesn\u2019t exist yet, so the condition `if ($null -ne $newestFile -and $latest -eq $true)` fails. A few tips: * Guard against empty imports:if ($newestFile -and $newestFile.Count -gt 0) { ... } * If `$filename_latest` doesn\u2019t exist, create it before running the compare:if (-not (Test-Path $filename\\_latest)) { Copy-Item $newestfilename -Destination $filename\\_latest } * Sometimes file writes from Ansible/PowerShell aren\u2019t \u201cready\u201d instantly \u2013 a short `Start-Sleep -Seconds 2` after copy can help in rare cases. So in short: * Fix `\"YYYY\"` \u2192 `\"yyyy\"` * Force consistent culture when writing/reading timestamps * Add some guards for empty/new files before you compare That should clear up most of the weirdness you\u2019re seeing."}

When a button is pressed (code is executed) the content on the screen freezes until it's finished. \\* If I launch a window using .Show(), the window is not interactive. The screen loads what you put in the code and then also freezes. The reason I use .Hide() in combination with .Show() is that If I use .Close() the window cannot reopen later on (like pressing the button again to call the loading screen). In the example what happen is: \\-> loading screen is called first using .Show() with a predefined size and textbox that has a yellow background \\-> the code continues until the other stuff is finished (in the example a simple start-sleep and loading the main window) \\-> loading screen is hidden by using .Hide() - not interactive \\-> the main window is shown by using .ShowDialog() - interactive, so I can use a button \\->a button is pressed to call the loading screen again, by using .Show() \\-> loading screen shows up with the correct predefined size and predefined title, but without the content (textbox and its content). \\-> code continues to execute stuff and asks the loading screen to hide again using .Hide() which it does.

That\u2019s why you only see `{write}` or `{manage}` and not `{read, write}` together \u2014 higher roles already imply the lower ones. If you need to change the role on an existing grant, use `Set-PnPAzureADAppSitePermission` (or remove and re-grant): # See current grants and grab the Id Get-PnPAzureADAppSitePermission -Site # Update the existing grant's role (recommended for CRUD: Write) Set-PnPAzureADAppSitePermission -Identity <IdFromAbove> ` -Permissions Write ` -Site # (Alternative) Remove then grant again # Remove-PnPAzureADAppSitePermission -Identity <IdFromAbove> -Site # Grant-PnPAzureADAppSitePermission -AppId \"TARGETAPPID\" -Permissions Write -Site TL;DR: Roles aren\u2019t cumulative; pick **one** per site grant.

Just in case if anyone is tying to do something similar. **Alacritty Configuration STEPS:** > **- C:\\\\Users\\\\<win\\_user>\\\\AppData\\\\Roaming\\\\alacritty** Open WSL, Create a shell script, update permissions and add the following: C:\\Users\\<win_user>\\AppData\\Roaming\\alacrity:> wsl $ f=start_tmux.sh && touch $f && chmod +x $f $ cat <<EOL > $f #!/bin/bash set -euo pipefail interop_enabled(){ [[ -r /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/WSLInterop ]] && grep -q '^enabled$' /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/WSLInterop } if ! interop_enabled; then echo \"[-] WSL Windows interop is disabled.\" echo \"[-] Try: wsl --shutdown Then reopen alacritty\" read -rp \"Press Enter to close...\" exit 1 fi SESSION=\"session-$(date +%s%3N)\" START_CMD=\"$HOME/.config/tmux/Powershell.sh\" exec tmux new-session -s \"$SESSION\" \"$START_CMD\" > Next, Open **alacritty.toml** and add the following \\[terminal.shell\\] configuration: [terminal.shell] program = \"C:\\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\wsl.exe\" args = [ \"-e\", \"bash\", \"\\\"/mnt/c/Users/6RIN/AppData/Roaming/alacritty/start_tmux.sh\\\"\" ] **Tmux Configuration Steps:** >**\\~/.config/tmux** **-or-** **C:\\\\Users\\\\<win\\_user>\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\wsl\\\\<instance\\_id>\\\\rootfs\\\\home\\\\<wsl\\_user>\\\\.config\\\\tmux** >Create another shell script, \\`PowerShell.sh\\` $ f=Powershell.sh && touch $f && chmod +x $f $ cat <<EOL > $f #! /bin/bash set -euo pipefail ## Or whichever directory you want powershell to start at. win_pwd=\"C:\\\\Users\\\\<win_user>\" ## Update if your Powershell Version and/or pwsh.exe location is different. command \"/mnt/c/Program Files/PowerShell/7/pwsh.exe\" -NoLogo -NoExit -WorkingDirectory \"$win_pwd\" -Command \"Clear-Host\" EOL >**Finally, Configure your \\`tmux.conf\\` to include Powershell client Commands for creating Powershell Windows/Panes:** ## ~/.config/tmux/tmux.conf set -g @pshell_script \"bash ~/.config/tmux/Powershell.sh\" # Powershell TMUX Client: bind -n C-p switch-client -T pshell # Open New TMUX PowerShell Window: <Pc> bind -T pshell c new-window -c '#{pane_current_path}' #{@pshell_script} # Open New TMUX Horizontal PowerShell Pane: <Ph> bind -T pshell h split-window -h -c '#{pane_current_path}' #{@pshell_script} bind -T pshell \"\\\"\" split-window -h -c '#{pane_current_path}' #{@pshell_script} # Open New TMUX Vertical PowerShell Pane: <Pv> bind -T pshell v split-window -v -c '#{pane_current_path}' #{@pshell_script} And now when you open a new Alacritty Window.

Then when you manually open up wsl -> tmux. You can still use the Powershell keybindings. Or, if you would prefer Alacritty to open up in Linux by default. Then drop the wsl args within alacritty.toml"}

Most things in IT is logical but without experience it's hard to know where to start. I was taught powershell at work many years ago and what finally got it to stick with me was digging into the very core principles of programming. \\* Basic datatypes (which in turn is usable in most languages) \\* Iterate arrays with hands on testing - this applies to practically every collection available. When you know how to do it move on to json, xml... once you got the hang of this, add in some string matching with regex or the built in methods like .StartsWith() etc - and now excel is obsolete for working with CSV. \\* Loops, how / when to use them. Recognize pitfalls and learn how to avoid it. \\* ACTUALLY USING IT. Anything. Really. Need to do basic stuff? Use powershell even if it takes 10 minutes longer. Every experience adds up. \\* Dont get stuck on using the built in stuff. Explore classes, write functions or even your own classes- and the door into programming will open up even further. It's trivial to write powershell once you know the basics of programming (in general). It's also VERY easy to go from powershell to python and (for me) javascript - but ONLY if you actually utilize it as a full language. One thing I had to do as a \"project\" to show I knew the basics was to code a vending machine. It had to return the correct amount of money if you put too much, reject if you put to little etc. Just the basics of a vending machine. It covers the if (or switches), the datatypes, loops and how to connect \"option 1 - soda X\" to user input."}

It's designed to be used as a shortcut location that can be manually setup or automatically with the other script in the repo. Before I go testing it, I would like it if someone could look over it and if possible, someone who uses something other than edge as their main browser could test it, that would be amazing.

Thanks for all the help in advance! ``` <# Clear-Edge-Cache.ps1 Purpose: Quickly clear Microsoft Edge's caches without touching cookies, saved passwords, or sign-in state by default. Designed to be a desktop shortcut. Default behavior (safe): \u2022 Clears HTTP cache, code cache, GPU/Shader caches, and Service Worker caches. \u2022 Does NOT clear cookies, local storage, passwords, or history. Optional behavior: \u2022 -Moderate switch also clears heavier site data (IndexedDB, CacheStorage, File System, WebSQL) but keeps Local/Session Storage intact so you don\u2019t get logged out. \u2022 -Aggressive switch clears everything Moderate does PLUS Local/Session Storage and Service Worker registrations (\u26a0\ufe0f may sign you out of sites). \u2022 -IncidentResponse (IR) switch performs a malware-mitigation deep clean: backs up all Edge data to a timestamped ZIP first, then wipes nearly everything except essential user data (passwords, cookies, autofill, history, bookmarks, preferences) so you keep your sign\u2011in and saved items. Requires **-Force** and double confirmation (two y/n prompts). \u2022 -RestoreBackup switch restores from a ZIP backup. If no path is provided, the most recent ZIP in %USERPROFILE%\\EdgeIR_Backups is used.

It's a shame that today's Google Chromium based browsers don't expose their APIs to do that same. Others have made many good suggestions for code improvements. I could only suggest to make several of the processing steps into functions. Have you explored the use of Browser Extensions or DevTools Protocol For Chrome and Edge, you can automate via the Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP): Launch browser with remote debugging: chrome.exe --remote-debugging-port=9222 Use a script to send CDP commands like Network.clearBrowserCookies, Storage.clearDataForOrigin, etc. There are Node.js libraries like chrome-remote-interface or Python\u2019s pychrome that make this easier."}

My mistake. Standard users do not have access to the directory with the applications in them. So navigating to that folder and launching the installers as admin is not possible. When I say \"run as\" I mean shift+right click on powershell and select \"run as different user\". I do not mean running the program within powershell as a different user. Apologies for my lack of clarity! ------------------------- For context, I am an IT tech of a few years though new at my current company. The way IT has their directory of applications available for install, adobe, M365, Kofax, etc is in a file share limited to only the IT accounts. So if a user decided they suddenly needed adobe, then the IT tech logs in with their account to the PC, goes to the file share, installs it, then signs out. The techs account is a DA, I don't think it's the best idea but it's not up to me, but if I can limit the times I use my DA interactively then that's what I'd like to do. My question is, if I run powershell as my account with access to our applications directory and navigate to the share that way to install it, is that a bad practice? If not, then ideally I could at least avoid signing the user out during the process. This method feels like something I would have seen before so I just feel like I'm missing something here. And once more, I am fully aware that using DA accounts like this is a bad idea. It's absolutely not up to me, I've made a case for tools like Admin by Request or at least putting our DA accounts into protected users but nothings come of that. I feel like I'm asking a really dumbass question. If so, please tell me"}

Personally I would have a local admin on each PC and install it that way with the script prompting for creds but way more secure than being saved. You can even us a sysinternals tool called psexec to launch powershell as admin with creds(in a non admin session) to install via an admin ps window. There is a million ways to install software instead of network shares, you can have the script grab the download directly from Adobe too I dont think you need to use the network share if its just Adobe, downloading a free installer is better imo Edit: i meant RunAs not PsExec however this is how it would work in PsExec.

If it is installed on a drive that is not present, IE user installed steam or a game to a external USB hard disk, skip trying to uninstall that game and raise a ticket for someone to go physically talk to the user. If it is something we can remove, then remove the application and the folder it's installed in, but since there are a million steam apps, this can be tricky and doesn't automate well. Then manually remove registry entries, which again doesn't automate well. Finally, if all the steam apps were removed, then delete the steam folders and it's registry entries. Instead of trying to clean up steam instead we now just modify the user's hosts file via autopilot to redirect [steampowered.com]( to [127.0.0.1]( and that solves most of the issues. If users get around that it's a polite in person note to not do that again if they'd like to remain employed."}

Configure Applocker or WDAC. Applocker is quite easy to set up. For uninstalling you'd need each apps silent arguments if you want to automate this. Probably many of those don't use the standard MSI or EXE ones. Store apps usually installed as user, if u run as system it won't even see them unless you specify all users. Either take a computer and note how to uninstall the apps or try locally."}

My coworkers didn't think that I would use Powershell 7.5 as a result and it lead to some confusion. I wish to make my scripts backwards compatible so they both can work cross platform, and so that my coworkers don't run into issues. What is a good resources for helping me keep track of such? 2) I organized the files and structures of my collection of scripts so that everything dedicated to the same function lived in the same file but what this lead to was a lot of individual files with one function in them that can be run from the cmd line willy nilly. I have been approaching Powershell with a C++, NodeJS, PHP, C#, Python Background.

Fortunately in syntactical terms, ps5 is a subset of 7 so if you stick to ps5 syntax, it\u2019ll work on 7 too. You do have to pay attention to pathspecs though; windows will take forward slashes just fine, but Linux has no concept of drive letters and windows can\u2019t unambiguously resolve Linux style paths as to windows, they\u2019ll all be relative to the cwd\u2019s drive letter. - for layout have a look at the modulebuilder module and its docs; it\u2019s a good unified starting point for a common module layout. It\u2019ll even let you compile all source files into a single module file and handle the manifest too. - speaking of manifests, those are the psd1 files in powershell; the psm1 is a script file that\u2019s taken as a loadable module. You can of course source files from there but you need to pay attention re: what\u2019s grabbed from where. - if and when a manifest (psd1) exists it\u2019ll be taken as entry point and it must exist at a specific location: `base path / modulename / moduleversion / modulename.psd1` Module name and version in file system must match declarations within the manifest. Otherwise ps will refuse to load it. And as we\u2019re talking Linux in addition to Windows, pay attention to case sensitivity too. The psm1 must be declared as root module in the psd1 and can be any name, but should be modulename plus psm1. Alternatively you can omit the manifest entirely; in that case there must be a psm1 to take its place. The psm1 can then be used to set up anything else, but note you can also use the manifest for that. - you source files with the period operator like eg bash does. But there\u2019s no source command and running the script won\u2019t add it to the current scope. But, again, it\u2019s preferable to use a tool chain to package your module for deployment. - you can import assemblies using add-type in script or as an entry in the required assemblies key in the manifest. - you can technically reference native code but you really shouldn\u2019t do that for scripts that are supposed to be cross platform. - all modules are technically libraries, so if I\u2019m reading you right you\u2019re going to have to rewrite script executables as functions. Otherwise they\u2019ll just be run on import time and that\u2019ll be that. There should be plenty docs on how to design modules; it\u2019ll mean a lot of refactoring at first yes but eventually it\u2019ll all be in the right shape. It can be a bit of a pain sure but it\u2019ll be far more painful if you try and avoid the refactor."}

That one ended up being quite popular so I figure it might be worth showing off the rest so here's a list: **AudioConfig**: A module for managing audio on Windows. Want to enable/disable a device? You can do it like this: `Set-AudioDevice '{0.0.0.00000000}.{41989358-1124-4185-ac5a-c083d476795b}' -Disabled` (Naturally there's tab completion for that ID). Want to change the output device for firefox? You can do that: `Get-AudioDevice | Get-AudioSession | where DisplayName -Like *Firefox | Set-AudioSession -OutputDeviceId '{0.0.0.00000000}.{41989358-1124-4185-ac5a-c083d476795b}'` **DisplayConfig**: A module for managing display settings on Windows. This is the one I've previously shared and you can read more about it here: **MonitorConfig**: A module for managing settings on the physical displays connected to a Windows PC. This uses the DDC/CI (Display Data Channel/Command Interface) standard to send commands from the PC to the display to adjust various settings. The main use is to adjust backlight brightness but you can send other VCP codes as well, like one for changing the selected input, or adjusting the color temperature. Naturally the available options depend on the physical display, but you can get a full list of supported VCP codes with a quick scan: `Get-MonitorVCPResponse -Monitor \\\\.\\DISPLAY1 -All`. **VfxSettings**: Just a simple module for adjusting the visual effect settings found in SystemPropertiesAdvanced.exe -> Performance -> Visual effects. The main use for me is to re-enable animations/transparency effects because apparently Windows 11 Education ships with those things disabled. **UsefulArgumentCompleters**: This does exactly what the name says it does: It provides some useful argumenter completers for many of the inbox PowerShell commands that for whatever reason don't have them. **UnattendXmlBuilder**: This module can modify or create unattend XML files. I personally use it to declare the unattend file in PowerShell because it's far easier to read than a huge XML file. For example, this is the file I use to deploy my dev PC: New-UnattendBuilder -UiLanguage da-DK -SystemLocale da-DK -InputLocale da-DK -SkipOOBE -LocalUserToAdd Martin | Set-UnattendProductKey -Pass windowsPE -ProductKey YNMGQ-8RYV3-4PGQ3-C8XTP-7CFBY | Set-UnattendComputerName -Pass specialize -ComputerName Dev-PC | Add-UnattendDiskPartition -Template UEFI -DiskNumber 1 | Add-UnattendImage -SourceImageIndex $MountedImage.ImageIndex -DestinationDiskID 1 -DestinationPartitionID 4 | Export-UnattendFile -FilePath $ISODir\\autounattend.xml 6 easy to read lines. A traditional unattend XML simply cannot compete with that."}

Using the company name as the root namespace is fairly common practice, but because I'm not doing this on behalf of a company I have to substitute the company name with my user name. I don't understand what the big deal is for you because you won't even see the typenames most of the time. I mean you call the cmdlets with their actual names: `Get-AudioDevice` and you use the enums as normal strings like this: `Get-AudioDevice -DeviceType Any`. If you are seeing the typenames then I'd argue that's a code smell. As for the plagiarism accusation, what you've found are just interface/Enum definitions used by the underlying API: it's only natural that they would look the same, especially because COM even requires a specific declaration order for the members inside each interface. If AudioDeviceCmdlets does everything that you need, then by all means, continue to use it. I made my version because I found theirs to be lacking a feature I needed and I didn't like the the way they had structured the cmdlets."}

I'm typing this up now from the newly refurbished (hopefully) system. I've tried to do a decent amount of research surrounding the syntax I'm seeing in Event Viewer, but I haven't yet found anything definitive... Although it's very possible I just haven't looked hard enough. I've come to the conclusion that this is a routine and safe check done by the OS regarding... *something* pertaining to file systems. I also sure I'm being a bit paranoid after being spooked with the threat of identity theft, since I'm aware of malware that can go UEFI-deep, although it's supposedly uncommon for an everyday bad actor to go to such lengths to do so to an average person. The Event Viewer reads as follows: `Details:` `ProviderName=FileSystem` `NewProviderState=Started` `SequenceNumber=7` `HostName=ConsoleHost` `HostVersion=5.1.26100.4768` `HostId=e98a2722-9732-4c05-85d9-eb715da691b8` `HostApplication=powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Restricted -Command` `$isBroken = 0` `# Define the root registry path` `$ShellRegRoot = 'HKCU:\\Software\\Classes\\Local Settings\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Shell'` `$bagMRURoot = $ShellRegRoot + '\\BagMRU'` `$bagRoot = $ShellRegRoot + '\\Bags'` `# Define the target GUID tail for MSGraphHome` `$HomeFolderGuid = '14001F400E3174F8B7B6DC47BC84B9E6B38F59030000'` `$properties = Get-ItemProperty -Path $bagMRURoot` `foreach ($property in $properties.PSObject.Properties) {` `if ($property.TypeNameOfValue -eq 'System.Byte[]') {` `$hexString = ($property.Value | ForEach-Object { $_.ToString('X2') }) -join ''` `if ($hexString -eq $HomeFolderGuid) {` `$subkey = $property.Name` `$nodeSlot = Get-ItemPropertyValue -Path ($bagMRURoot + '\\' + $subkey) -Name 'NodeSlot'` `$isBroken = if ((Get-ItemPropertyValue -Path ($bagRoot + '\\' + $nodeSlot + '\\Shell\\*') -Name 'GroupView') -eq 0) { 1 } else { 0 }` `break` `}` `}` `}` `Write-Host 'Final result:',$isBroken` `EngineVersion=` `RunspaceId=` `PipelineId=` `CommandName=` `CommandType=` `ScriptName=` `CommandPath=` `CommandLine=` ... and it basically is identical for Providers \"Registry\", \"Variable\", \"Function\", \"FileSystem\", \"Environment\", et al... Is this a normal system operation that's always been there, or is there something suspicious going on? EDIT: I've also run WIndows Defender post-wipe and detections came back clean."}

There's some build stuff here that I can't TLDR well.** ## Background: I mentioned in [my prior post]( that I wanted to use Wasm as a cross-platform interoperability layer with Linux/FreeBSD's implementation of libarchive. Not all implementations include all features of libarchive, but the original version generally includes everything. Now I could start off by diving into the deep end of the libarchive build configuration *or* I could use a pre-existing one. Lucky me, there's already a build targetting wasm: # Archive-Wasm NPM Library Now, the problem with archive-wasm (and many wasm utilities) is that they target wasm *in JS specifically*. Meaning this and many other wasm tools don't work out-of-the-box in non-JS environments without notable changes. However, the nice thing for this specific library is that only a few changes need to be made to make it usable from Wasmtime in PowerShell. ## The Build Directory They already start us with an excellent build environment for libarchive: - it even includes some of the external libraries that libarchive works well with, so we can get the full featureset. The most notable file from their build directory is the building Dockerfile: - It contains literally everything we need to build it, but like I said before, you'll notice certain things like [Line 246]( where they are specifically targeting Wasm in JS. In my fork, I changed this to just build to wasm directly: - - ALSO NOTE: I also removed wrapper.c. I don't believe we need it. Now, its also worth highlighting [this section of the Dockerfile]( Here they disable a lot of build variables. The only 2 that I believe that were worth enabling were the ACL (-DENABLE_ACL=Off/On) and XATTR (-DENABLE_XATTR=Off/On) flags. - I believe that everything else was disabled either because they caused bugs or because they don't produce anything useful for wasm. - However, feel free to change these flags in your build if you determine you need them. ## Building I've forked the archive-wasm repository with the necessary changes needed to make the library work in powershell. You can review these changes here: - Also if you're not sure if you will have the right build environment set up on your system, if you have [Ubuntu multipass]( (which is cross-platform), you can use this cloud-init.yaml to get yourself the necessary build environment: - ``` $init = path/to/cloud-init.yaml $outside_dir = \".\" # a directory on the host to share files with # (iwr \" | Out-File $init multipass launch --name archive-wasm --memory 6G --disk 20G --cloud-init $init --network \"<your-network-adapter>\" multipass mount \"$(Resolve-Path $outside_dir)\" archive-wasm:/home/ubuntu/shared # reboot the VM, so that the file share gets mounted correctly multipass stop archive-wasm multipass start archive-wasm # connect to the VM multipass shell archive-wasm ``` Whenever you are in your build environment (multipass or not), you can run the following to build the wasm: ``` git clone cd archive-wasm ./wasm/build.sh # If using the multipass mount from above cp ./src/wasm/libarchive.wasm ./../output ``` ## Distributing the .wasm with Your PowerShell Script There are several options to do this. You can distribute it: - as a separate file and load with `[Wasmtime.Module]::FromFile` - store in your script as a byte sequence and load with `[Wasmtime.Module]::FromBytes` - or if you translate the file to .wat using `wasm2wat` (the multipass cloud-init.yaml includes wabt, which includes wasm2wat), you will then have the wasm in a human-readable format that can be stored as a string in your script and interpreted with `[Wasmtime.Module]::FromText` For the rest of this post, we will be distributing from file. ## Loading and Utilizing the .wasm in Your PowerShell Script Just as I explained in [the prior post]( setting up wasm in PowerShell is really easy: ``` # Install-Module \"Wasmtime\" $package = Get-Package -Name \"Wasmtime\" $directory = $package.Source | Split-Path $runtime = \"win-x64\" # \"win/linux/osx-arm64/x64\" # Make sure native wasmtime is findable: $native = \"$directory\\runtimes\\$runtime\\native\" | Resolve-Path $env:PATH += \";$native\" # Load managed wasmtime: Add-Type -Path \"$directory\\lib\\netstandard2.1\\Wasmtime.Dotnet.dll\" $engine = [Wasmtime.Engine]::new() ``` Now, we're going to diverge from the previous post by showcasing how to load wasm from file and then also dumping its Exports (FFIs for you Python folk). Doing so is pretty easy: ``` $module = \"path/to/libarchive.wasm\" | Resolve-Path $module = [Wasmtime.Module]::FromFile($engine,$module) # dump the Exports to see all FFIs: $module.Exports ``` If you've done it correctly, you should see something like this: ``` PS > $module.Exports Parameters Results Name ---------- ------- ---- {Int32} {} free {Int32} {Int32} malloc {Int32, Int32, Int32, Int32} {} archive_set_error {Int32} {Int32} archive_entry_clear {Int32, Int32, Int32} {} archive_entry_copy_mac_metadata {Int32} {} archive_entry_xattr_clear {Int32} {} archive_entry_sparse_clear {Int32} {Int32} archive_entry_clone ... ... ... ```"}

Dive into C# to understand what PowerShell is actually doing - you can't optimize what you don't understand, and your clients will expect performance at scale. Study advanced concepts like runspaces, parallel processing, proper error handling and learn to write compiled cmdlets when performance matters. Your Graph API work is good, but can you handle pagination properly, implement exponential backoff, or deal with throttling at enterprise scale?

Instead, I'd recommend exploring higher level concepts like systems architecture and design, systems engineering, and focus on how system interoperability. Getting into API scripting is a good start, but don't get caught in the weeds about specific APIs. Learn common API methodologies (especially with authentication) and it largely doesn't matter what you are connecting with. Everything API related can be reduced to inputs and outputs to a larger process. TL;DR: PowerShell is an amazing tool, but if you want to make a career out of automation, then focus on higher level concepts and expand the tools in your toolbox."}

I've been writing powershell as well as other languages for more than 10 years, My company has a GitHub Enterprise account as well as tons of Microsoft agreements so we have access to GitHub copilot I've been testing it over the last few months in agent mode using the gpt 4.1 and Claude Sonnet 4 models, The former being the cheaper. If I ask it to produce something out of thin air, yeah I usually get back something overly verbose and not even that useful and I can easily spend hours trying to get it to go in the correct direction. But if I just start writing a script using my existing knowledge. It still saves me a ton of time. For example, I like to splat arguments for commands, so if I predefine the command with like `start-process @params`, And then I define my hash table splat array above it. I might start typing the first argument and I'll see the agent suggest all the other arguments populated based on what it guessed were the best variables from my param block at the top of the script, It's rarely 100% accurate, but now I usually have to make a few corrections and I can move on to the next section. The other day I asked it to look at a python script I wrote using argeparse to read And handle command line arguments. I included the description sections like a description of the script and the description of each argument when I configured it. So when I was done with the project, I asked it to produce a section of markdown at the end of my existing readme for this repo to document how the script works and it gave me something that was 95% what I needed. The true value of these llms is giving them enough context to be useful, which usually means using them in some kind of agent mode where they can actually live Read your documents, And then it comes down to the person behind the keyboard knowing a thing or two about what they're writing and not just doing pure vibe coding having no idea what any of it does, In the end, you're still submitting a pull request with your name on it, which means you're responsible for the code that gets used. Do I love writing scripts and have I done it for decades? Spent thousands of hours researching how to do things agonizing over getting some bit of complex logic to work or decoding cryptic APIs that are poorly documented, sure, I love it but I don't think there's any way to roll back the clock. This is the way we do things now, And if you're not doing it that way, I would really suggest learning, especially if you're not at the end of your career."}

So this is where it starts inventing commands and modules and hidden settings that don't actually exist because it would please you if they did because that answer is what you like you \"think\" you want, so as far as the model is concerned, it's met its objective whether that comports with objective reality was never the goal."}

So far, it's been great learning along with the labs, but have recently gotten to a section dealing with Pipeline Parameter Binding methods, more specifically \"Pipeline Input ByValue\". When following the examples or figures shown, I noticed that when running \\`Get-help\\` for a command. all the parameters display \"False\" for \"Accept Pipeline Input?\". Yet, in the examples shown in the book, some of the parameters appear as \"True\", as well as have ByPropertyName, ByValue, or both next to it in parentheses. Another example is running 'Get-Help New-Alias -Parameter Name', where \"Accept input value?\" is set to \"True (ByPropertyName)\", yet when I run it, it's set to \"False\". Book Example: Get-Help New-Alias -Parameter Name -Name <System.String> Specifies the new alias. You can use any alphanumeric characters in an alias, but the first character cannot be a number. Required? true Position? 0 Default value Accept pipeline input? True(ByPropertyname) Aliases none Accept wildcard characters? false When I run it: Get-Help New-Alias -Parameter Name -Name <System.String> Specifies the new alias. You can use any alphanumeric characters in an alias, but the first character cannot be a number. Required? true Position? 0 Default value Accept pipeline input? false Aliases none Accept wildcard characters? false I tried searching if someone had a similar issue but can only find another post where someone mentions that after the newest update, 'Get-Help' no longer displays \"ByValue\" or \"ByPropertyName\" anymore under a parameter if it's set to \"True\" for \"Accepts pipeline input?\". I've tried uninstalling/reinstalling PowerShell 7.5.2, running as an administrator (assuming it was a permissions issue), and even installing from the Microsoft store, yet come across the same issue that none of the parameters appear to display accept pipeline input as \"True\". If someone can point me to the right direction it would be greatly appreciated as it is a little difficult following with the rest of the chapter when following the examples, thank you! And apologies if this is not the right place to post about this, I can remove if needed. Additionally, if it helps, I am running PowerShell 7.5.2 on a Win10 machine if that affects anything..."}

If get-help says pipelining is not available, then it\u2019s not available, no matter what the book says. Whether that\u2019s an error or whether the parameter definition changed between then and now is secondary. You\u2019re not going to get your PS instance to adhere to the book. If you want an example as to what get-help says about pipelining, have a look at the cimcmdlet module\u2019s functions. These are guaranteed to come with both byvalue and byname type definitions. Also, get-item and the like. Parameter binding is a rather complex topic in powershell, but that\u2019s because it tries to make things easy for everyone. For pipelining, what\u2019s important is; - only one parameter per parameter set can take a byvalue parameter, because ps must be able to select the parameter set according to the input type. - for passing by name, you can have however many such declarations as necessary. Type is irrelevant to binding and ps will try coercion to make it work. What matters is that there\u2019s an object property whose name matches the receiving parameter name OR an alias to that parameter. Basically powershell must be told that, if there is input from the pipeline, where is it supposed to bind it. That\u2019s really all there is to it - no declarations at all and it can\u2019t deal, ambiguous declarations and it can\u2019t deal either."}

IronPython has an arguably lighter footprint due to not requiring a Python installation. - However, there are problems with IronPython: - It's not perfectly low footprint, because it still requires an ipy search directory for modules. - IronPython also lacks a CFFI module. - Its only Python 3.8 compliant - One concept I'm toying with is CPython in wasm. That should help fix most of these problems - Using Linux/Unix libraries like libarchive to accomplish things that aren't possible (or easy) in Windows/C#. - Particularly using Linux libraries like libarchive to set x-attributes on files in a Windows System, by writing files to a .tar archive (which is capable of storing x-attributes even though Windows doesn't support them). - The real problem that this would solve is that while windows does have .tar writing implementations, they often omit x-attribute writing features, so using a Linux writer instead should in theory allow me to stuff like implement [macadmin-scripts/installinstallmacos.py]( on Windows Another \"because I can,\" I've been thinking about is running WasmLinux inside of PowerShell.

I am pretty obsessive about the scripts I write being resilient and leveraging all the capabilities of the language where appropriate. My instinct is that a tool doing code generation would produce somewhat brittle code that I would then have to go and review/fix before I could implement it, which might take me longer than if I had just written the code myself to begin with.

Set \"*Start in:*\" to blank 5. Set the display name of the shortcut to something succinct and useful. 6. Save The **powershell path** will depend which version of powershell you are using. **NoLogo** stops the powershell start text from flashing on the screen (cosmetic) **NoProfile** stops the user's profile script(s) from running when PS starts. Running the profile can take a bit of time so slow your command loading irrelevant stuff but, more importantly, it may be doing things you don't want in clean PowerShell run. Even if you don't have a profile, include this in case you start adding to you add one later or the shortcut is used by someone who does have one. Keep it clean. If you need anything done, do it purposefully in the script not randomly via the profile. **ExecutionPolicy Bypass** is potentially a little better than remotesigned. You actually want to run the script you specify, no questions asked. Use the **full ps1 file path** so you can move/copy the shortcut. Blanking the **Start in** location make the script start in the shortcut location, whatever that is. Otherwise, this defaults to the PS exe location which is a read-only system area that you shouldn't usually be doing operational stuff in. If your script needs to run in a particular location, using Set-Location in the actual script is more robust. Sometimes you may want the script to run against any folder you copy the shortcut to, eg, a clean up operation, this is the way to do that. You can also change the icon for a shortcut to something in the library. That can help if you have a bunch of icons. Usually the default powershell icon is appropriate."}

Would like to ask on how I could go about creating a Powershell script that is able to restart Edge browser and also simultaneously restore all previously opened windows and tabs? There is a small caveat in that my organisation has disabled the \"auto-restore\" feature in Edge under the on startup settings, yet somehow they still want me to achieve this. Is this possible and if yes, please let me know how. Thanks!"}

Probably... But it would be very convoluted and somehow use APIs to enumerate all edge windows, tabs, and sessions, somehow save them somewhere (safely), close everything, and then try to restore those. It would most likely fail often. That is what that option is for. It is made to handle that properly, efficiently, and securely. Trying to reverse engineer that functionality from outside the app seems that it would be doomed to fail and cause a loss of data (or leak of session data)."}
