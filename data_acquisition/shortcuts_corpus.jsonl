But when I listen in the bathroom, unfortunately it can leak into his bedroom, which is adcjaent. In the off-chance I’m having a shower concert at a time when he needs more quiet in his bedroom, I made this shortcut. Any time he can text me “volume down” and it turns my music down to level that doesn’t reverberate the walls. Usually it isn’t an issue because he’s not home. But I consider this a great concession in case our schedules conflict. Our apartments have excellent soundproofing, so turning it down to 70% takes care of any sound leak. High trust with my homie neighbour."}

His brother, the other owner told him to stop and wiped the hard drive twice and was getting fed up with it. Especially his constant denials. So my friend had a plan. They created a fake “error” message with their ISP’s logo and a detail message about how their illegal porn usage has caused the isp to suspend their account for two weeks. They saved the image on the C drive and made it the home page for the browser. At around 7am the next morning, the owner is calling his brother, frantic that he just shut down the company’s access to the internet. Apparently late the night before, he had been calling his son to fix it. Who had no idea what he was talking about. Then he called the ISP himself and tried to explain this error and the poor tech guy hadn’t à fucking clue what was going on. So he eventually had to come clean to his brother. It went brilliantly."}

Thanks to this sub I’ve been learning more about Shortcuts and tinkering over the past month or so, and I finally have a set up that I think is worth sharing. Here’s a breakdown of how this works at a high level: * When I press the Action Button, the Shortcut will run and wait for 1 second. * If I press the increase volume button, it opens my authenticator app. * If I press the decrease volume button, it opens a menu with apps that I can open. * If I do nothing, it toggles Silent Mode (i.e. the default Action Button behavior). * If I do nothing AND I’m driving, it opens a menu with destinations that I can map to using Google Maps. I think the logic should be reasonably easy to follow from the screenshots, but one nuance is around the volume. I’m creating a variable called “Initial Volume” that stores the volume when I first trigger the Shortcut, then setting the volume to 50% and storing that in a different variable called “Volume”. When I check to see if the volume increases or decreases, I check it against “Volume”. Why? Because if you already have the volume set to the lowest value when you trigger the Shortcut, you can’t decrease the volume more which prevents the App Launcher from running. Once everything’s done, I set my volume back to the “Initial Volume” value. This was cobbled together using a lot of ideas from this sub so thanks to the people that inspired it! The setup may look complex but it’s surprisingly super intuitive to use. ~~EDIT:~~ [~~Download here.~~]( EDIT 2: ***See my reply to this comment for detailed instructions on adding this to your phone.*** EDIT 3: Thanks to a rec in another thread for Menu Box, my lists are now a little prettier!"}

The important thing to understand though is that Shortcuts are a simplified way of programming. Watching some tutorials for beginning Python would probably be helpful but could also be overkill if you’re not interested in programming. The fundamental concepts you want to understand are variable assignment and if statements, and from there you really just chain things together one step at a time. I would recommend looking at the small steps as opposed to the big picture, so for example if you have a simple Shortcut that opens an app, just try to add a condition in front of it, e.g. run this Shortcut when…"}

Download these 3 Shortcuts: [1]( [2]( [3]( 2. Open Super App Launcher to make edits. 1. In the top cell that says **Choose from menu with Open...**, replace **App 1** with the name of the app you want mapped to that option. 2. In the bottom area, you should see a cell that's been renamed to whatever you replaced **App 1** with. 3. Below that cell, you should see an indented cell that says **Open App**. 4. Tap the **App** part of **Open App** and select the app you want to open when you select this option. 5. Repeat for the remaining rows. 3. Open Super Map Launcher to make edits. 1. In the top cell that says **Choose from menu with Map to...**, replace **Destination 1** with the name of the location you want directions to. 2. In the bottom area, you should see a cell that's been renamed to whatever you replaced **Destination 1** with. 3. Below that cell, you should see an indented cell that says **Open Driving directions from Current Location to Current Location Using Google Maps**. 4. Tap the *second* **Current Location** and search for the address you want to get directions to. 5. Repeat for the remaining rows. Couple notes: * I added room for 12 options to each Launcher Shortcut but you can add or remove as you see fit at the top of each Shortcut in the **Choose from menu** cell. * If you prefer to use a different map app, tap **Google Maps** and replace it with the app of your choosing for each row in that Shorcut."}

I don't want my kitchen lights to flash red when it's about to rain, or have all my blinds close and lights dim and phone go on do not disturb whenever I turn my TV on. I'm glad people are really excited about this stuff (I am too!) and doing complex automations is a great way to learn how all this stuff works, but I can't imagine actually living in a house that has tons of triggers set up."}

There’s time saved which is easy to measure. effort saved isn’t as easy to measure but as far as I’m concerned if a task can be automated to be easier then it’s a greT candidate for automation Usually automating a task to be faster also makes it easier. But here’s a really basic example, and I can provide more if you need I have a shortcut for turning off my heat pump if it’s on and on if it’s off. Annoyingly the IFTTT applet that controls the heat pump can only send on or off commands, not a toggle command, so I have the shortcut first check an iCloud document for the status of the heat pump, then issue the relevant command to IFTTT, then update the document to the new status. The iCloud checking and updating slows the shortcut down somewhat It’s faster to open the heat pump app, select the heat pump and toggle the heat pump on or off. But that’s 3 taps in different places on the screen I have to concentrate for longer than I would if I just ran the shortcut from the homescreen. It takes longer to complete, but I don’t actually have to do anything after I tell the shortcut to run. So takes slightly longer, but it’s easier."}

Now before you jump all over me, screaming about how it’s not even close and it’s kindergarten programming; know that I’m well aware of this. But I’m willing to bet that there are a lot of people in my position who are finding these shortcuts maybe not super useful, but certainly intriguing. So while the majority of shortcuts may not be useful, if they pique someone’s interest, and make them think, and learn, and possibly find an interest in something that they found the bar for entry too high before; then I think they’re all great. So I hope people keep cranking them out, regardless of their usefulness. Because someone out there may have the greatest idea for one, that we’d all find useful. And if poking around inside of a silly shortcut helps them understand it better and put them on the path of creating the next great shortcut, then I think that’s amazing too."}

From left to right **Music:** - Say you shuffle your music, you land on a song you love and you want to play the whole album. This will do it. [LINK]( - Shuffle a playlist of favorite songs (~3000) [LINK]( - Sometimes I listen to an album of an artist I just discovered, so I like it and I want to know where to go next. This will take you to an aggregator that ranks the artist’s top albums. [LINK]( - Tweet a song you’re listening to with an album artwork and a YouTube link of your choice (it’ll take you to YT app and you copy a link then it’ll take you back). [LINK]( - Shuffle all songs [LINK]( - Shuffle albums (you play a random album in full then move to the next random album). [LINK]( - Play one song of your choice and then shuffle all songs. [LINK]( - Get artwork of your current song [LINK]( - Add current album to your favorite playlist (same playlist mentioned above) [LINK]( - Similar to the one above except here it asks you for input which should be an artist name [LINK]( - Search lyrics of current song [~~LINK~~]( [Better shortcut]( **Keyboard shortcuts**: - Presents some codes (¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ etc) [LINK]( - Lets you type a setup and a punchline then copies the text to your clipboard [LINK]( - Type an emoji and it’ll name it [LINK]( - Get a wall of text from your clipboard, find a word and replace with another. [LINK]( **Camera roll:** - Create a grid from camera roll [LINK]( - Combine Screenshots [LINK]( - Upload to imgur and copy link to clipboard [LINK]( - Save video from Safari [LINK]( - Convert video to GIF [LINK]( - Select multiple screenshots and delete them [LINK]( **Web**: - Open a Reddit link in Apollo [LINK]( - Same for Tweetbot [LINK]( - Download YouTube [~~LINK~~]( [Update]( - Download videos from major social networks [~~LINK~~]( [Updated shortcut]( - Download a file [LINK]( - Shorten URL [LINK]( - Want to read a NY times or WashPost article and get hit with a paywall? This will take you to an add free webpage of the whole article [LINK]( - Show a graph of an Amazon product from CamelCamelCamel [LINK]( **Utilities**: - Kidnapped and want to ask for help but don’t know SOS? Well, this can save you by sending the signal using flashlight [LINK]( - Flip a coin [LINK]( - Control center DND has improved but not dramatically. Sometimes you want to turn it on and disable at a certain time. This allows you to do that. [LINK]( **Random**: - Calculate how many days between two dates [LINK]( - Calculate Tip [LINK]( - Speak body of article [LINK]( Edit: Just updated my comment with links.

For this to work the easiest you need an iPhone XR, XS, XS Max or 11 as they can read nfc tags asking as the phone is unlocked. If you have an X you have to open an app first to read the tag so it’s not as time-saving. In the shortcuts app you hit automations at the bottom and then ‘create personal automation’. Hit NFC, scan the tag and name it whatever you like. Then when it asks what you want to to do, search for ‘timer’ and then just set how long you want the timer. Make sure you select ‘run without asking’ so that you don’t have to confirm you want the shortcut to run. And you’re done!"}

Donations welcome to $Sonikkua on CashApp! Or donate to a worthy cause of your choosing, even better!* **EDIT:** Amazon knows a good idea when they see one, I’ve been Sherlocked! Just open the following URL in Safari once you have Shortcuts installed: This shortcut may be useful when getting pulled over by the police. It pauses any music that may be playing, turns down your brightness and volume, turns on Do Not Disturb, and sends a message to the contact of your choosing letting them know you’re being pulled over and what your current location is. It then opens your front camera and starts a video recording so you have a video record of being pulled over. Once you stop the recording it sends a copy of the video to a contact you specify, puts volume and brightness back to where they were, turns off Do Not Disturb, and gives you the option to send to iCloud Drive or Dropbox! Works best when used with a phone dash mounted, but that’s just my opinion. **EDIT:** Automatic start of video recording is now here! Just make sure you’re running Shortcuts 2.1 or newer! **ANOTHER EDIT, BECAUSE 3732469 HAVE HAD A PROBLEM:** Make sure you are opening the link in the full Safari web browser on iOS 12 with the Shortcuts app installed. Not Chrome, not your Reddit clients built in browser, not anywhere else. If you are getting an error about invalid links or being redirected to the Shortcuts gallery, this is why. Once the Shortcut in installed set it to run via Siri: **EDIT:** I made the news :-) FAQ: **Can I run this from the lockscreen? With the phone screen off?** Nope, Shortcuts limitations. **What about an Android version?** Nope, not from me anyway. **How do I stop the recording?** Press volume up, or tap the stop recording button on screen. **Can I automatically send the video?** No, after you have finished the recording you do manually have to hit send. **Can I interview you for NEWSPLACE???** Nah, done with all that now. I’m an introvert and not much accustomed to all this attention."}

Ever since Apple launched Apple music they have been preventing Spotify (and others) from reaching feature-parity on the system level. You still can't ask Siri to play anything on Spotify and that's apple's restriction as its hogging those commands for 1st party software you cannot circumvent. Look at all homepod reviews - unless you have apple music that thing is pretty much useless in terms of music. This is the same thing all over again as not being able to set default browser, email client etc. So Apple is actively preventing Spotify from building a good version of the features you want. Shortcuts might circumvent that if Apple allows it. Btw I have been using Spotify for years and own only Apple devices."}

So I basically have 20 albums with 1 image each in them named accordingly to the battery percentage they represent. I then created the automations in Siri Shortcuts that worked like this, for example: “If battery goes below 50% > find image > image filter: album titled “50” > set wallpaper (no preview, no zoom, do not ask before running automation). If battery goes above 50%, set wallpaper to _____.” I did this for every 5% increment, so I had to make 40 automations."}

The US version for example got some weird sizing bugs, because the number was not interpreted correctly and couldn’t be changed to the format of your country, since it was initially interpreted as text. I updated the shortcut to set the value as a number and this works perfectly now!"}

Is this overly-complicated? Yes. Is this likely unnecessary? Yes. Overkill? Definitely. Was it worth it? Absolutely! I wanted to make a shortcut for my action button that I would find useful regardless of the scenario I was in. This mainly came down to location so that was the main motivator here. I have my action button set to run the “Action Button” shortcut. It then checks if my phone is facing down. If it is then it toggles the flashlight. This is because you never know when you need a flashlight, but when you do you don’t want to be messing with menus or anything. Quick, easy, simple. Then we check to see where the device is located so we can bring up so more context-related menus. That’s where the “Location Category” shortcut is ran which is the real meat and potatoes of this shortcut. I won’t go into too much detail for the sake of my fingers, but it basically has a list of locations in a dictionary that I’m interested in making a menu for. Each of those entries has a “query” which is used to find that location with maps, as well as a tolerance which is the radius (in miles) of how close I have to be to make location’s menu trigger. You may ask, “why not just put a specified address for each of those locations and call it a day?” Well to answer that, it’s because I would like these menus to pop up no matter what location I’m at, regardless of what gym, grocery store, movie theater, Walmart, etc. I decide to visit. With this approach, any location I’m interested in making a menu for will always be covered under these general queries. Continuing on, the lower “repeat with each” block loops through each of the locations in the dictionary and queries maps with their respective “query” and returns the closest x locations to me. Then with each of those it checks their distance from my current location. If it lies within the tolerance, I must be at that location. It will then return the location category back to the action button shortcut so it can run that specific menu. The upper “repeat with each” is a sort of caching mechanism and is a consequence of the overall querying taking a tad too long for my liking, especially at locations where service is spotty. It didn’t ever take terribly long but I felt like when pushing the action button I should be able to see a menu right away and get to where I want to go with no time wasted. It basically looks for its cache file and loops through the lines, each of which with the format “category:latitude,longitude”, and compares it to my current location’s latitude and longitude completely offline. It does this with the haversine formula which is accurate enough for this use case. If a match isn’t found in the cache then it continues with the lower “repeat with each” block as previously explained and adds that location to the cache for faster access next time. This in practice cuts a whole lot of time off of the location checking and makes things almost instant. If a match isn’t found then it returns nothing. Returning back to the “Action Button” shortcut, if something is returned from the “Location Category” shortcut then it runs that category’s menu. If nothing is returned then no match was found for the location and it simply opens the utility menu. The menus themselves contain actions that I might find useful in that scenario. Some are unfinished but it’s a work in progress (always is). I tried mapping out the shortcut as best I could in the diagram in terms of control flow. Sorry for any fuzziness on the smaller fonts, it’s the best I could do. Lots of work getting this idea to work (probably a little too much). Let me know if you have any questions!"}

I have one on the phone holder on my bike that opens fitness mode and Strava. There’s one on my gaming monitor that sets reminders every 20 minutes for me to get up and stretch and drink water. It also turns my phone on gaming mode which turns off all notifications except for my fiancé. There’s one on the cat litter box that works in the same way as the snake feeding one does. And I have one for each deep cleaning chore I do around the house that sets a reminder anywhere from a week to a month to do that chore again (wash bedding, clean bathtub, etc.) You just really need to recognize what you struggle to get done regularly, take note of it, and build an automation around it. It’s really cumbersome to me to open the reminder/calendar app and type all of this in so that keeps me from doing it. But if the nfc tag does that for me I’m more likely to get it organized."}

So, I created this solution for people like me. This automation will save all the messages received from a specific contact into a note. To set this up, first, you need to create a new note in the Notes app where the messages will be saved. I recommend naming the note after the contact so it’s easy to find if you have multiple notes. Refer to the photos for the automation setup. This automation will automatically copy the messages received, allowing you to read them anytime, even if the sender deletes them. Steps: 1. Create a new note in the Notes app. 2. Go to the Shortcuts app, then the Automation section. Create a new automation and select “Messages.” 3. Choose the contact for which you want this automation to run under “Sender,” select “Run Immediately,” and click next. 4. Select “New Blank Automation.” 5. In the search action, look for “Append to Note.” 6. Hold on the text option, select “Shortcut Input,” tap on Note, and choose the note you created in step 1. That’s it!"}

It’s a fairly complicated system, but I think you guys are going to like this. Here’s the deal: &#x200B; I’m a wedding photographer. I get enquiries through my website from new potential clients. When they enquire, I call them and see if I can schedule a meeting with them. That phone call generates a lot of data, though, and I need to keep track of that data and also action that data. Here’s the data that’s collected every time I make a call: &#x200B; * – Did I call the client? * – Did the client answer the phone? * – Did the client ask for me to call them back later? * – If yes, when should I call back? And a reminder should be set for this call * – Did I get a meeting with the client? * – If yes, when is the meeting? * – Where is the meeting * – A calendar entry should be set automatically * – Did the client ask for my pricing? * – Have I sent them the pricing? * – Did the client ask to check their schedule for a meeting? * – If yes, send them a link to my scheduling page to ease the scheduling process * – Assuming I didn’t get a meeting, and all I sent was my pricing or scheduling link, a note needs to be made of when I need to follow up, and a reminder should be set for that as well. * – A note should also be made of how many times I’ve tried to call * – A note should be made of how many times I’ve followed up. &#x200B; All of that data gets created in a single call to a client. I can’t possibly keep track of it manually. I also need to email the client after all of that with an email that’s built around the nuances of that data. So I came up with the idea of building a shortcut that will basically do all of this for me with very little interaction from my side. Below is a link, but using it just like this will leave you with a bunch of questions, so I’ll answer them below: &#x200B; &#x200B; **HOW IT WORKS:** When a client enquires with me, I run a separate shortcut from Airmail that pulls the data of that enquiry into a reminder in a list I have called “Potential Clients”. The reminder is titled with the name of the client, and the notes of the reminder is the data I already have from the enquiry (Mobile number, email address, wedding date, etc). The shortcut also adds placeholders for all the other data above. So the average note to one of these reminders looks like this: &#x200B; *Wedding Date: 24 Nov 2018* *Email Address:* [*whatever@whatever.com*](mailto:whatever@whatever.com) *Mobile Number: 0821234567* *Call Count: 0* *Pricing Sent: No* *Follow Up On: No* *Contact Date: 24/03/2018* *Meeting Date: No* *Follow Up Count: 0* *Meeting Request Sent: No* &#x200B; All the “No” answers above are just placed there as a default. Once the first call is made, those all adjust accordingly. &#x200B; # The Main Shortcut: Then I have a separate Shortcut that is the main one. Here’s what the shortcut does: 1) It checks my “Potential Clients” list, and shows me all the names, and asks me to choose a client 2) After I’ve chosen, it takes the notes of that reminder, and builds a Dictionary of the notes. That way, I can call on and adjust all that data easily. 3) It then asks if I want to check the client’s wedding date against my schedule to make sure I’m available. If I do this, it opens fantastical to the date of the client. This way I know if I’m available or not. Then I return to the shortcut. 4) At this point, the shortcut asks if I want to call the client. If I select yes, it calls the client, and records the fact that I called the client. 5) After the call, the Shortcut starts asking me the questions I listed above, and records all that data. This process takes me about 10 seconds at most, and the shortcut is doing all the work. 6) Once I’m done there, the shortcut opens and compiles an email that fits perfectly. For example - if I scheduled a meeting, and the client asked for my pricing, the email will read: *“Hi <FIRST NAME>,* *Thanks for taking my call!* *Just to confirm, our meeting is on blah blah blah at blah blah blah.* *You can view my pricing here* *Thanks\"* Of course, the email is longer and more detailed than that, but you get the idea. If the client hadn’t asked for pricing, that part of the email simply wouldn’t be there. 7) After the email, the client’s entry in the “Potential Clients” list is removed, and they’re moved to another list that makes more sense. If I got a meeting, they’re moved to my “Meeting Set” list. If I didn’t get a meeting, they’re moved to my “Follow Up” list. I have a number of other shortcuts that engage with those lists as well. &#x200B; So if you want to test this, you need to do a few things: &#x200B; Create the following lists in your reminders app: Potential Clients Follow Up Meeting Set &#x200B; Once that’s done, run the following Shortcut. This Shortcut will create a bogus client in your “Potential Clients” list. &#x200B; [Client Generator Shortcut]( &#x200B; Once that’s done, you can go ahead and run the main Shortcut: [Shortcut]( &#x200B; Future plans: – I hate that the Shortcut is one long thing. It’s WAY too long, and I’m busy building 3 shortcuts that will do all of this stuff. Having 3 will make it easier to make changes. – I need some “Quick Options” immediately after the phone call. Instead of the first questions being “Call answered?”, and “Call Back?”, I should have a few options that just do everything. For example, many of the calls result in the client needing to get back to me on a date. In that case, I want to have an option immediately after the call that will make all the data adjustments in the background based on save assumptions that can be made if I choose that option. &#x200B; Let me know what you guys think about it, and if you have any questions!"}

Afterwards you can decide with a clear mind if you really want to proceed to the app. The immediate effects are that you‘ll become aware of your unconscious social media habits: opening Instagram while waiting for the bus, just because you’re bored. This is often not an aware decision. And taking a deep breath helps you to reflect on yourself in that moment. Long term, “one sec” increases the effort of opening a particular app. This makes it less likely that you open an app just like that. If it ain’t worth one deep breath, you won’t need to open that app anyway. Even after 2 weeks of using the app every day I find myself in situations where I unintentionally open Twitter, and then a deep breath is just what I needed: to realize that I didn’t want to open Twitter at all. The setup works through Apple’s Shortcuts app, which comes pre-installed on your iPhone. Go to the Automations tab, and select an “Open App” Automation, add the “one sec” shortcut, and disable “ask before running”. That’s it. [Here’s the app]("}

Thanks for the awesome comments. Really glad you guys enjoyed this little experiment of mine. If you want to replicate it, here's more details: What you need: **— A recent iPhone** (iPhone XS and later supporting background NFC tag reading) — **Shortcut app** (see below) **— Apple Music** (or any other music app that can be triggered with a shortcut) **— NFC tags** [ Not the cheapest, maybe not the best quality either but they've worked smoothly so far. **— Rounded Square Cards** I've used the MOO Print online service. Their products are awesome, great quality and materials. I used the original square business cards (2.56\"x2.56\") with rounded edges and 16pt thickness. Almost the exact same size as the album cover art in Apple Music user interface! You can print up to 50 different designs. [ &#x200B; Each \"mini album\" contains an NFC tag sandwiched between 2 cards glued together. Each card is paired with a shortcut via the NFC automation feature in the Shortcuts app. The shortcuts are pretty basic. 1. Vibrate (physical feedback to let the used know that the phone received the instruction) 2. Optional synesthesia bonus! Change the color of the lights (Jazz music is blue, right?) 3. Set destination to the Homepod (or any other source) 4. Play the album 5. Open the app. I like to get a \"visual feedback\". Here's a shortcut exemple [ More images here ["}
