If i'm an ISP and I want to for instance take down a whole bunch of equipment for servicing and in the process, slow down customer speeds. This should be totally fine. HOWEVER with the regulations, there are specific rules that prevent me from slowing customer speeds with out the proper reasons. Those reasons have to be proven to the FCC which takes time and money. This is why it makes competition more difficult. It creates a barrier of entry for new operations. Due to the regulations, larger legal teams are required. This costs money and makes entry to the market more difficult. The bad thing in this case it that the existing ISPs already have these legal teams to deal with this issue. So they will not be impacted by the regulation at all. In many cases, they will blatantly break the law and deal with the consequences because they know they will make money doing it. Also let me get this straight. You want the guy in charge of the FCC to make rules to regulate the internet? Have you seen the stuff that this guy says? You can not have thought this through."}

This decision has far-reaching consequences that not only hinder app developers but also affect the experience of moderators and users alike, including [impacting accessibility]( The lack of function in Reddit's official app has made far from a complete solution for moderators, and left many users dissatisfied with their experience with it as well. \u200bIn response to this situation, r/opendirectories has joined with other subreddits in a coordinated effort. We believe that unity is essential in driving change and advocating for the rights of app developers and the overall user experience. To amplify our message and demonstrate the strength of our concerns, barring any significant positive changes in Reddit's plan, **r/opendirectories will be participating in a blackout starting on June 12th, lasting at least 48 hours.** During this blackout period, the subreddit will be set to private, rendering it inaccessible to all users. This collective action is intended to raise awareness and urge Reddit to reconsider their recent API changes. Our primary goal is to initiate a productive dialogue with Reddit, leading to a reversal of the detrimental modifications they have implemented. We understand that this blackout may cause temporary inconvenience to our community, and for that, we apologize. However, we firmly believe that this short-term disruption will bring long-term benefits for every user. By standing together with other subreddit communities, we hope to send a clear message to Reddit and foster a meaningful conversation about the future of their API policies. In the meantime, we encourage you to let reddit know that you disagree with their planned changes \u200bThere are a few ways you can express your concerns: * [Sign this open letter to Reddit]( * Contact contact@reddit.com or create a support ticket to communicate your opposition to their proposed modifications. * Share your thoughts on other social media platforms, spreading awareness about the issue. * Show your support by participating in the Reddit boycott for 48 hours, starting on June 12th. \u200bWe appreciate your understanding, support, and active participation in this important endeavor. It is through the strength and dedication of our community that we can strive for a better Reddit experience for everyone involved. --- TL;DR: --- * [Infographic]( * [13 minute video Summary]( --- Further info: * [Save 3rd Party Apps]( * [For moderators]( * [Impact on r/blind subreddit and accessibility]( * [Details from developer of Apollo]( --- **2023-06-08 EDIT:** * [Takeaways and recommendations after API meeting with /u/spez and Reddit]("}

It could also be useful for the other folks, who knows ? # What is an open directory ? Open directories (aka ODs or opendirs) are just unprotected websites that you can browse recursively, without any required authentication. You can freely download individual files from them. They're organised in a folder structure, as a local directory tree on your computer. This is really convenient as you can also download several files in a bunch recursively (See below). These sites are sometimes deliberately let open and, sometimes, inadvertently (seedboxes, personal websites with some dirs bad protected, ...). For these last ones, often, after someone has posted them here, they're hammered by many concurrent downloads and they're getting down due to this heavy load. When the owners do realise it, they usually decide to protect them behind a firewall or to ask for a password to limit their access. Here is coming the famous \"[He's dead Jim]( flair. Technically, an opendir is nothing more than a local directory, shared by a running web server: cd my_dir # Share a dir with python python -m SimpleHTTPServer # With Javascript npm install -g . # Open your browser on or local IP> from another computer. # Usually you should use a web server like Apache or Nginx with extra settings # You also need to configure your local network to make it accessible from the Internet. # How to find interesting stuff ? Your first reflex should be to track the most recent posts of the sub. If you're watchful, there's always a comment posted with some details like [this one]( and you can get the complete list of links for your shopping (\"Urls file\" link). You can still index a site by your own if the link of the \"Url file\" is broken or if the content has changed, with [KoalaBear84's Indexer]( Thanks to the hard work of some folks, you can invoke a servile bot: [u/ODScanner]( to generate this report. By the past, u/KoalaBear84 devoted to this job. Although some dudes told us he is a human being, I [don't believe]( them ;-) You should also probably take a look at \"[The Eye]( too, a gigantic opendir maintained by archivists. Their search engine seems to be broken currently, but you can use alternative search engines, like [Eyedex]( for instance. Are you looking for a specific file ? Some search engines are indexing the opendirs posted here and are almost updated in realtime: * [FilePursuit]( * [ODCrawler]( With it, as a bonus, you can [download their database]( It's an opensource project. Your contributions (manpower and financial) are welcome. Don't you think that clicking on every posts and checking them one by one is a bit cumbersome ? There is a good news for you: With [this tip]( you can get a listing of all the working dirs. &#x200B; # Any way to find some new ODs by myself ? Yes you can ! The most usual solution starts with the traditional search engines or meta-engines (Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo ...) by using an advanced syntax as for [this example]( Opendirs are just some classical sites after all. If you're lazy, there are [plethora of frontends]( to these engines which are able to assist you in building the perfect query and to redirect to them. Here is [my favorite]( As an alternative, often complementary, you can use IoT (Internet of Things) search engines like [Shodan]( [Zoomeye]( [Censys]( and [Fofa]( . To build their index, their approach is totally different from the other engines. Rather than crawling all the Web across hyperlinks, they scan every ports across all the available IP adresses and, for the HTTP servers, they just index their homepage. Here is an [equivalent example]( # I'd like to share one. Some advice ? Just respect the code of conduct. All **the rules are listed on the side panel** of the sub. Maybe one more point though. Getting the same site reposted many times in a small period increases the signal/noise ratio. A repost of an old OD with a different content is accepted but try to keep a good balance. For finding duplicates, the reddit search is not very relevant, so here are 2 tips: 1. Using the [KolaBear84's page]( 2. With a Google search: `site:reddit.com/r/opendirectories my_url` # Why could we not post some torrent files, mega links or obfuscated links ... ? *The short answer:* They're simply not real opendirs. *A more elaborated answer:* These types of resources are often associated to piracy, monitored, and Reddit\\`s admins have to forward the copyright infringement notices to the mods of the sub. When it's too repetitive the risk is to get the sub closed as it was the case for this [famous one]( For the obfuscation ([Rule 5]( with base64 encoding for instance, the POV of the mods is that they do prefer to accept urls in clear and dealing with the rare DMCA\\`s notices. They're probably automated and the sub remains under the human radar. It won't be the case anymore with obfuscation techniques. There are some exceptions however: *Google drives* and [*Calibre servers*]( (ebooks) are tolerated. For the gdrives, there is no clear answer, but it may be because we could argue that these dirs are generally not deliberately open for piracy. Calibre servers are not real ODs but you can use the same tools to download their content. By the past a lot of them were posted and some people started to complain against that. A new [sub]( has been created but is not very active as a new player has coming into the game : [Calishot]( a search engine with a monthly update. # I want to download all the content in a bunch. How to do it ? You have to use an appropriate tool. An exhaustive list would probably require a dedicated post. For your choice, you may consider different criteria. Here are some of them: * Is it command line or GUI oriented ? * Does it support concurrent/parallel downloads ? * Does it preserve the directory tree structure or just a flat mode ? * Is it cross platform ? * ... Here is an overview of the main open source/free softs for this purpose. **Note:** Don't consider this list as completely reliable as I didn't test all of them. ||Concurrent downloads|Able to preserve the original tree|Client/Server mode|CLI|TUI|GUI|Web UI|Browser plugin| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |[wget]( |[wget2]( |[aria2]( |[rclone]( |[IDM]( |[JDownloader2]( Here is my own path: # To download an url recursively wget -r -nc --no-parent -l 200 -e robots=off -R \"index.html*\" -x # Sometimes I want to filter the list of files before the download. # Start by indexing the files OpenDirectoryDownloader -t 10 -u # A new file is created: Scans/ # Now I'm able to filter out the list of links with my favourite editor or with grep/egrep egrep -o -e'^*\\.(epub|pdf|mobi|opf|cover\\.jpg)$' >> files.txt # Then I can pass this file as an input for wget and preserve the directory structure wget -r -nc -c --no-parent -l 200 -e robots=off -R \"index.html*\" -x --no-check-certificate -i file.txt # Conclusion: Welcome on board and Kudos to all the contributors, especially to the most involved: u/KoalaBear84, u/Chaphasilor, u/MCOfficer u/ringofyre"}

They also DMCA a lot of good stuff and their pagerank algorithm penalises http and anything without AMP. I only trawl through google after I've narrowed down search criteria. There are plenty of guides for how to search for ODs with google and they mostly apply to duckduckgo/bing as well. The one thing that most of these guides miss is how to search through IP address URLs. The filter: `site:\"*.100\"` will get you urls of the format ` loop through `100...254` and you'll pick up a lot of stuff. Unfortunately these tend to be static addresses, I suspect google delists the dynamic ones. Shodan on the other hand does index them... **Shodan/Zoomeye** Shodan and zoomeye are great to use because they only index headers (shodan) or headers+main page (zoomeye). I use these two to search for things that are found in filesystems, but not really anywhere else, like; * .DS_Store - mac thing I dont know what it does * .Trashes - mac thing I dont know what it does * .Trash - mac thing I dont know what it does * .htaccess - website access config file * .bash_history - *.nix file * .bash_profile - *.nix file * .bashrc - *.nix file * nohup.out - *.nix file * @eaDir - directory created by synology that pollutes everything * thumbs.db - windows thing, if this exists then pictures do as well * Desktop.ini - windows thing, no idea what it does * .gitconfig - git stuff * .gitignore - git stuff * .gitattributes - git stuff As well as those I look for things that are usually associated with torrent files, like; * Torrent_Downloaded_From_Demonoid.txt * *.torrent * Extratorrents_RG.txt * RARBG.txt All these find an OD, then I look to find the general format and search further with google/bing/duckduckgo. Usually it's something like title: * \"directory listing of\" * \"directory listing for\" * \"listing directory /\" * \"Content of folder /\" * \"folder contents\" Also text that's specific to an type of OD and isn't usually found with a normal google search, like; * \"Powered by, Directory Lister\" * \"Powered by H5ai\""}

I'm about to run a new dump of the sub in a week, so they will be included if you post them in the meantime. If you decide to share a pastebin of the complete list, I can include the links. ODShot checks the status and that they are really opendirs. But my concern with this approach, is that we don't check the content and it could be sensitive regarding the rule 3."}

I find myself playing games less, and just compiling them and tweaking them more. My kids play games too, but they never venture out past Apex Legends, Fortnite and so on. Every so often they stumble into my room and find me playing some old Arcade game and comment on how garbage the graphics are.

It started with downloading the complete MAME set (including the massive \"Software List CHD's\") and attempting to keep it up to date. Then it spilled out into other systems... and I am just becoming a digital hoarder, as I said to one of my buds. I find your comment about your kids interesting - that they are not branching out as much. My friend has a son who has been playing Minecraft for something like 6 years now. He loves it. He almost never plays anything else. We're talking a kid between the ages of 10-16. When I was that age (Atari 2600/C64 era), maybe a little younger, I was playing as many things as I could get my hands on. Maybe it's a difference in the immersiveness of the world, I can't figure it out. I say we revel in being old dinosaurs. I can't imagine what it is like for kids today growing up with 4K gaming and then looking at a gaming system that has a resolution of under 160x192 (A number quickly googled for the Atari 2600, and if it's not accurate, I think everyone gets the shock of the comparison stepping down...) It will be funny though when THEIR kids look at dad's crappy 4K screen vs. their SuperMegaHyperReality resolution and laugh."}

Those of you who follow my work or hang out at [the-eye]( saw this a few days ago but I thought it deserved a wider audience. This post is part of an ongoing project to liberate books from private trackers, this first release is a 2.6TB selection from Bibliotik. For those of you who don't know what a private tracker is it's a website, usually invite only for torrents with strict rules, often focusing on a particular topic. Bibliotik in particular is rather strict on who they let in and their own rules about maintaining your account to retain access. It's a private tracker sought after by many and at the time of writing this there are 6,337 active members with a database 414,474 releases. **The Data** ------ As mentioned this is an ongoing effort so this first release isn't a complete dump, but a very fair start. You'll notice some letters missing, those will be added in the coming weeks and new content added to the directories as it lands on our servers. * 186,777 Items * 2.6TB * [the-eye.eu/public/Books/Bibliotik/]( **Bibliotik Staff** ------ This release is in accordance with your rules about the uploading of the data itself to other sites and platforms. I work closely with people looking to maintain and grow projects like LibGen & Scihub. Bibliotik has been a unparalleled source of high quality book content for years and my release doesn't aim to step on any toes but simply make your releases more widely available. If you have any qualms over such releases or wish to aid my efforts come talk to me. **Community** ------- You can reach me [here]( on reddit, in the [r/DataHoarder IRC]( (GreenObsession) or on [our discord server.]( Come chat to everyone, see our new content before anyone else and join other like minds. **Supporting Us** ----- ^We're ^entirely ^community ^funded ^and ^only ^exist ^because ^of ^you ^and ^for ^you, ^If ^you ^like ^what ^we ^do ^consider ^donating ^towards ^our ^operating ^costs. ^$650.00/month ^covers ^all ^of ^our ^costs. * [^PayPal]( * ^BTC: ^bc1qq8p74xxnrkdxn3yruhfavf8z26fxzf5ahpyah8 * ^ETH: ^0x98f91eB0F3fDda4f6aCcb16384E3e40869a76F3D * ^For ^any ^and ^all ^other ^crypto ^options ^speak ^to ^The ^French ^Guy#1255 ^in [^our ^discord.]( * [^Amazon ^Wishlist:]( ^this ^hardware ^is ^either ^directly ^for ^our ^primary ^server ^of ^will ^be ^installed ^at ^our ^DC ^to ^better ^our ^capabilities."}

I entirely understand your point in this, but at the of the day you're a pirate getting mad because someone pirated your piracy. You also highlighted concern over publishers coming down on you due to me using your name to which I've made claim that is unnecessarily worrisome given the-eye is very public and we see much less of this than you ever would due to the nature of you being so locked down. ----- This is the response I always expected of you going into this.

Sure I don't get to decide your level of acceptable risk, but I'm telling you I don't think that there is risk in the first place. I believe that your level of paranoia is unwarranted based on my running an open platform for 3 years and having communication with publishers in this time.

Without that library, you either have to make do with the fonts you've already paid for, or have an entirely separate step to go to different sites and check out fonts, while trying to picture how they'd work in your project.

Thanks for showing your gratitude towards this post and I will soon next week (or earlier) post the cartoons mentioned in this post. NEW EDIT- I have once again collected all Scooby-Doo Where Are You! Episodes and now I am creating another post on this Subreddit that is attached with a MEGA link.

So for the past year or so, I've been building up an absolutely massive directory of cooking recipes, mostly grabbed from very old, almost completely dead websites -- relics of the early web. In the early days of the Internet, things like images and multimedia formats were too complex and bandwidth-heavy for the web browsers of the time. So, things like cooking recipes were shared and collected in simple plain-text formats. Near the turn of the millennium, archives of these recipes, often collected manually by an individual, began to appear on personal websites. Most of these never survived past 2010, but a lucky few managed to stay up all the way into 2019. These are valuable, because almost no plain text recipes exist on the internet anymore, let alone entire archives of them. I've found that recipes are often overlooked in data archiving, so I decided to make my own archive. To my knowledge, this is one of the largest cooking recipe directories in the world. The whole directory (50 GB) consists of `Original-Directories` and `Recipes`. `Original-Directories` has all of the original mirrored websites, with no trimming. Good for those not just interested in recipes. `Recipes` is trimmed down much more; I tried to cut it down to recipes only. Each folder in either directory is a website that I archived from. This serves as credit for the original creators. Read the readme file in the root of either directory for more details. Please note that *most* of the recipes use US units. Some don't, but most do. If you are an international user, I sincerely apologize if this causes you any inconvenience. If you have anything to contribute, please comment if you do! Google Drive link (I know it's not really an OD, but this was the most cost-effective method): [ Archive.org link, uploaded by u/makeworld: Torrent/Magnet (zipped dirs, please seed!): `magnet:?xt=urn:btih:wbrzm4hdmzx7ybgpx5z5lfeajwizsnxw&dn=Recipes` Note: This directory and the torrent *will be updated* as I find and receive new content sources. The end goal is to save as much of the early internet's cooking history as possible. Feel free to share!"}

This collection contains many classic sample CDs from the 90s - 00s (Zero-G, Best Service, AKAI, Spectrasonics etc.) and the original archive.org page had over 14,000 views. With the help of a few other people, I have collected around 500 CDs from the original archive, and converted most of them from their original formats. Some of the disc images require proprietary tools to use properly, and will show up as broken or empty if you try to open them in an archiver or mount them as a disc. I have taken the liberty of converting what I can to uncompressed .wav files. Many samples in these libraries were simply taken from other works of electronic music, which means a lot of these CDs are no longer officially available to purchase from the companies legally. Many of these CDs are, or at least, were hard to find on the internet before the archive.org collection was made. It should also be noted that the takedown notice was only targeting a small minority of the whole collection, however it still resulted in the entire archive being removed. You can find the open directory at You can also download the torrent file from For information from the original uploader you can go to"}

However, if you browse to Disc 3 Partition 3 - Alaap Male there is Alaap 1 - 25. Comparing both of the INDALAAP 5 files from each of these locations shows them to be the same recording. I believe that this is because Disc 1 Partition A contains what is called the 'Indian Set' sort of a sampler of the various sounds that can be found in more detail in the other partitions. Spectrasonics does this on many of their other products. Heck, Heart of Africa Vol. 1 has a teaser for Vol. 2 on the disc! Symphony of Voices does the same thing where there are collections on a certain partition where you can find more of that style or articulation type in other folders. To me, everything in the Heart of Asia set looks good!"}

To deal with this issue and in an attempt to keep this sub focused on what is/isn't an open directory I decided to mirror them all, find more and make them all actual open directories hosted at the-eye. If you don't care about the details then here's the first 39 of them making up **127,104 books** and taking the-eyes book item count to **1,050,159!** > **The Difference Between Open Directories & Calibre Libraries** -------- An open directory by definition is generally not done on purpose (so unlike the-eye as we use the same technologies and method but do it on purpose, which is why some people argue that we're not an open directory, because we do it **for you** on purpose and make it look a little pettier) so open directories usually exist due to the server/site owner misconfiguring their software (be it apache, nginx, etc) allowing for what is known as an open index/directory of the files they're hosting. This terminology here gets a little confusing to some. As to prevent an open index you would actually add an index{.html|.php|etc} file, which web servers read and display when you browse to the directory. For example here's a site at the-eye we offer both with and without the index pages. * [parazite.the-eye.eu]( ~ Site as intended. * [the-eye.eu/public/parazite/]( ~ Site without index files, thus allowing it to be displayed as an open directory. While we do use a theme at the-eye we only have a single index file at our root, which is what you get when you land on the sites homepage, in our case an index.php file. However when you navigate to /public where all our files are we don't include any index files resulting in what we now have established to be an open directory. Our webserver software (nginx) comes preconfigured to block access to directories that don't have an index file so [unlike apache]( we have to take the extra step to allow open directories on purpose. We do this with the [ngx_ **So why isn't Calibre an open directory?** If the above didn't already answer this question let's first cover where I think the confusion comes from for most. The Calibre libraries that are posted here are also somewhat miscnofigured, either on purpose or by mistake by their nature of not requiring a password and are therefore known as Open Calibre Libraries because they don't require login credentials. They aren't open directories because Calibre deploys it's own webserver software resulting in index pages being built to allow information, pictures, etc to be displayed about the books. Pure and simply not an open directory which is why there's been such a fuss over them and why /r/opencalibre was born. **Finding the libraries and setting fire to your router!** -------- So this is the meat of the project. The libraries that have been posted here so far are mostly found at random with a stroke of luck, or sourced from sites like shodan. We can call these *known libraries*. Over the course of the life of the sub there have been around 3000 libraries posted, most of which are dead today leaving only 150-200 still online and these are reposted every now and again for us to in effect ddos them because we have zero self control and feel the need to download everything at once. This is a problem. We're ruining the chances for people to get these files for themselves by posting them here because more often than not there hosted on residential internet connections which are both slow and often have a dynamic IP address. So we kill the bandwidth with our mass downloads and the IP has likely changed when we rediscover old links posted months from when they were originally discovered/posted. **So what can be done about this?** Simply put we stop posting the the libraries we find until at the very least we have backups in places like the-eye that can handle the influx of traffic and effectively serve them. We download them, index them and make them available. This ensures the files aren't lost or are only available to the select few that caught the posts early. **How do we find them?** This is where the fires start. Sure this hasn't happened in a while but yes I'm speaking literally, under shoddy conditions doing what I'm about to describe can set fire to a router/switch. The most effective way to find these libraries is to scan the internet for them fortunately tools to do this are readily available, to name a few nmap, masscan and zmap. Some of you may already be aware of these apps and you may even be aware of the many ways this badger can be skinned but I'm going to use the method as follows. The first tool I'll be using is zmap and will scan the whole IPv4 range, which amounts to around 3.7 billion addresses. This is the part that will at the very least bring your network to it's knees if you don't now what you're doing so I suggest you do not do this at all, certainly not on a residential SoHo router. I'll explain the basics of how this works while looking for a single port, often people run Calibre on port 8080 so we will look for it there in the examples, however you can change this setting so they can be found on many ports but focusing on the common ports will return most results, we can look elsewhere later. From this point on the presumption is that you're familiar with a unix environment, so I want explain too many of the details. Here's the zmap command we will be using to hit as many IP addresses as possible as fast as possible looking for those that have port 8080 open and log the results to a file. `zmap -p 8080 -i eth0 >> zmap_8080.log` Once we've got this list the next tools are much more gentle on your hardware and then we only have to worry about pissing at those feet. Because we just scanned the internet that means **everyone** including government and military addresses and this next step fingerprints the services running on those addresses which will set off alarm bells in dark backrooms and basements at the likes of the DoD, NSA, CIA, FBI, GSN and NNIC to mention a few of the stateside bunch. So again, I suggest you don't do this. This time around we're going to be using nmap and it's built in scripting engine (nse) to identify the http services running on port 8080. `nmap -p 8080 -vvv --script= -Pn -n -iL zmap_8080.log >> zmap_8080.report` In particular we're looking for **Server: calibre** which is followed by it's version number, here's a full output example. Nmap scan report for 162.250.210.246 Host is up, received user-set (0.16s latency). Scanned at 2020-01-12 06:25:44 CET for 21s PORT STATE SERVICE REASON 8080/tcp open syn-ack | | Accept-Ranges: bytes | Connection: close | Content-Length: 1985641 | Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8 | Date: Sun, 12 Jan 2020 05:26:05 GMT | ETag: \"837043ac8e32ae5f0e13455950426b25f282a12f\" | Server: calibre 4.6.0 | |_ (Request type: HEAD) Which is the result of this host ` and library (we're already aware of, it's been backed up) So, once the nmap scan is done we can open up the report file and look for these instances via grep or any preferred method. ------- Righto, that's the basics.

That's ok. It is relatively deep and conceptual and outside the full context some of it can be lost in \"translation\". > thats some nice new made up bullshit to be honest my dude LOL, if 74 years old can be considered \"new\". Karl Popper was pondering (**in 1945**) what it would mean to be tolerant of everything... even toward those who are themselves practice intolerance and through that intolerance want to force their will onto others. It stems from the ideal that tolerance is a virtue. Furthermore, racism is not the only form of intolerance. It is but one among many. In general, it is not one's beliefs or even one's words that are the danger from intolerance... it is the actions, often unconscious, that one takes that either directly harms others or otherwise excludes others from their rightful place and opportunity within the community. It is, in essence, the mere fact that they are viewed as an \"other\" that is the problem. Poppler's paradox was how can a society that wishes to be tolerant of different viewpoints, different cultures, different races, different genders, and so on and so on... continue to thrive if they must also tolerate the actions of the intolerant. His conclusion to the paradox was that if a society was forced to be tolerant towards those who will practice in intolerance the freedom of all to even try to be tolerant was at threat. As with violence, the only time it can be truly justified in a civilized society is in the face of violence itself."}

A philosopher. A pretty prominent one at that. You should consider reading some of his books including the one in which this paradox comes from. It is called \"The Open Society and Its Enemies\". Have you ever read a book on philosophy or from a philosopher? I do wonder but have my doubts. If so, which ones? > All of this shit in your head comes from a certain group of people that no one is allowed to name. Philosophers? Well, I minored in philosophy so yes I guess you are right that a lot of what I think and believe comes from them. But generally, it is a good thing to have clarity of thought. (You might consider it yourself, I promise it doesn't hurt. Although fair warning, once you start down the path of critical thinking you often give up many of your currently accepted beliefs.) > It's not deep, it's sociological bullshit No. It's an examination of how you balance a virtue with what can be adverse effects of that virtue taken to an extreme. This happens with lots of things in life actually. Virtues are like \"rights\" as discussed in free societies... they become interesting not when viewed as absolutes but when placed into real situations where they must be balanced against one another. Sociology is an entirely different pursuit entirely. It is the scientific examination of group dynamics with particular focus on expression in human behavior. What Popper was examining is a branch of philosophy known as aesthetics with a sub-branch focused on the notion of virtues or what we call \"good\" versus what we call \"bad\" and how they are defined, identified, and balanced. > all the authors all come from the same ethnic or religious group. I'm guessing that you are thinking \"jew\"... which is typically bigoted of you. And as is so often true of bigotry it is frequently proven wrong as is true in this case. Popper was not Jewish but a Lutheran. > Sorry. Find a new angle. We don't dismiss valid lines of thinking just because they upset a bigot. You need to find a valid argument of refutation on your own. Simply using the word \"bullshit\" three times is not a magical incantation that accomplishes anything substantive.

Since we're taking about length of phone numbers, when we visited my grandma in Bay City, MI phone numbers were written as LI2-9729 and spoken as \"Lincoln 29729\" and if you were both \"Lincoln\", you could call another house with just 29729. Dad never explained to me how that worked. 55 years later, I still remember that being my cousin's phone number. Dad did take me to the office once for an open house and took me to see the switches. It sounded like a room full of brass crickets. Second City was a comedy show that had something called 'sniglets' which were words that didn't exist but should. \"Telecrastination\" was defined as waiting until the second or third ring even though your hand is right next to the phone."}

No power mod to server to install * Cons: Raid0 volatility, config/driver 8TB - 2.5\" Sata based (4.4Gbit/s at drive, 3Gbit/s on controller) * $547.99 - `amazon.com/Samsung-Inch-SATA-Internal-Gray/dp/B07L3CLM2B` * Total - $1095.98 * Pros: Common hardware, no config/driver * Cons: Speed limited by sata2, power mod to server and jerry rigging Seems to make more sense going with pcie for ease, no? What do you guys think? **New Data @ 10Gbit/s** ------- Here I've put some new data on our current ssds in the new server, mostly for testing our new connection. This is a dump of the Higher Intellect collection @ preterhuman.net and will serve as a 10Gbit/s mirror after the owner rate limited downloads at the source. Read more about this collection here: `137.4GB` in `592,600` items. (ncdu) Get it fast as possible: `curl -s |parallel -j 42 'wget -m -np -c -R \"index.html*\" {}'` [cdn.preterhuman.net/texts]( -------------- thecoverproject.net Game covers dump... * /site - `60GB` in `16,582` items. * /raw - `21GB` in `3451` items.

I would recommend you look at 1.8-2TB 2.5\" SSDs on SATA. Yes you're going to be limited by the SATA bus speed but it's still going to provide more than enough performance to max out 10Gbps when ran in raid 60 or similar.

The most common types are RAID 0 (striping), RAID 1 and its variants (mirroring), RAID 5 (distributed parity), and RAID 6 (dual parity). RAID levels and their associated data formats are standardized by the Storage Networking Industry Association (SNIA) in the Common RAID Disk Drive Format (DDF) standard.While most RAID levels can provide good protection against and recovery from hardware defects or defective sectors/read errors (hard errors), they do not provide any protection against data loss due to catastrophic failures (fire, water) or soft errors such as user error, software malfunction, or malware infection. For valuable data, RAID is only one building block of a larger data loss prevention and recovery scheme \u2013 it cannot replace a backup plan. *** **Non-RAID drive architectures** The most widespread standard for configuring multiple hard disk drives is RAID (Redundant Array of Inexpensive/Independent Disks), which comes in a number of standard configurations and non-standard configurations. Non-RAID drive architectures also exist, and are referred to by acronyms with similarity to RAID, several tongue-in-cheek JBOD (derived from \"just a bunch of disks\"): described multiple hard disk drives operated as individual independent hard disk drives. SPAN or BIG: A method of combining the free space on multiple hard disk drives from \"JBoD\" to create a spanned volume. Such a concatenation is sometimes also called BIG/SPAN.

C&Ds hmm, those are something else and we just deal with them case by case. > Everything you suggested I've been involved in, tor, ipfs, i2p, etc. Sure great technologies, the-eye however will always remain public, open, easy access for all with a simple browser. > This has always been our intent, we don't plan to start hiding now. > > Futhermore a site of our size couldn't exist on tor, etc. not due to a technological limitations but simply because we're entirely community funded and the community wouldn't fund something with such a high barrier to entry, while me and you may find it easy to route through tor or proxy chains the general user doesn't and/or can't be bothered to, driving them elsewhere. > > I've now lost count of how many people have suggested what you're suggesting now, or how many times I've told people to go away, this is the first time I've made effort to cover exactly why we're not going down that road, so see yourself lucky. Myself and my staff are all well aware of or have used the technologies you're suggesting, read: we're not fucking stupid. also read: we exist as we are on purpose, fuck. -------- So, you having read that it should cover everything, but for good measure lets talk about torrents. We don't offer [many torrents]( due to the very large file count of the datasets we host, we want to remain indexed by google etc so people can drive by download individual files, creating torrents of most of our datasets would mean packing the sets into zips or equivalent to not cause torrent compatibility issues with many common clients. I feel like I constantly have to state my credentials in running the-eye, I've been involved data distribution via many means over that last 18 years or so having run my own private trackers, ftp trading sites, DC++, etc. The-Eye exists as an open directory on purpose, I'm well aware of all the other possible methods of distribution and I've used them myself, again the-eye is an open directory and dmca compliant on purpose, I've covered this so many times it hurts to be talking about it again. People like you two seem to talk down to me like I'm unaware of the technologies you're suggesting or just simply dumb. I can't stress enough we operate exactly as intended and we're not just stumbling around with our thumbs up our assholes making it up as we go along. ------------- /u/Surpentstone >Its really just some 14 year olds trying to level up a discord bot. I don't know what this is in reference to honestly, but I think anyone reading this would call you out as the 14 year old. Among other things you were banned because you posted a *meme* about school shootings, that's just in very bad taste and unfitting for our discord no matter which way you look at it. >I thought they would be all about opsec Why would you think that? We're very open about what we do and how we do it, we don't however expect people to conduct themselves so poorly and attack us over silly and childish things such as memes, no matter the content of the meme. To lower myself to your level, you seem to think the internet is serious business. -------- /u/Camelfoe >but until they start to take security seriously I'm afraid it would just be wasted. Again, I'm unsure what you mean by this, do you expect us to be a hidden service on bulletproof servers in order to support what we're doing? If so, you're effectively asking us to serve less data to less people, a 32TB site on the tor network wouldn't seem more than a terabyte of traffic a month and even that is a high estimate, currently we're serving in excess of one petabyte each month and that's impossible via tor, etc. Also we're community funded, the barrier to entry tor adds would mean we lose 1000's of users overnight, you and myself may know how to access hidden services and it's by no means hard but the general public have no idea what tor is and simply don't care to learn. >Right now they're basically a flashing light for anyone that wants to DMCA them. And from what I've seen they're loaded with DMCA-able content. On purpose, for many reasons we can discuss if you want, but this comment is already long enough. I hope the three of us can remain civil and continue to discuss what I've addressed here but I think the bottom line is that because we're not running the site exactly how you want you're just not happy and I have to say as two people who talk a lot of smack but haven't put your money where your mouth is I think you just enjoy complaining."}

The new ssd is populated but I've been busy working on something else for you all, this post is about that. **The-Eye Volatile Storage Project** ------------ This project aims to vastly expand our storage capacity allowing us to serve much larger datasets from proxied storage, our first release under this project is the AlvRo rom set with an initial release of 82TB. Rate limiting applies to these datasets, 4 connections per ip, unlimited speeds. These directories aren't here to be mirrored for the sake of it but to provide data to those looking to actually make use of it rather than just have it sat on their drives. * [82TB initial AlvRo release]( (Note that some dirs are huge and will take a moment to render the page.) **The AlvRo Mess** --------- For those of you that keep up with the rom sites and rom related drama here's what happened with alvro broken down. * I heard alvro was retiring, first I'd even heard of the guy * I joined a discord full of people scrambling to save the collections * A dev at the-eye modified rclone to work with 1fichier, allowing me to clone the collection faster than anyone else * Alvro joins the discord and after conversation about preservation he gives me his accounts (2) * All is going well with the cloning, around 60% done * I wake up the following day to messages from alvro freaking out, having recovered his accounts * We talk and it seems as those it's a misunderstanding (language barrier), he again gives me the accounts * Day's go by, all is going well, we're all talking about how best to serve the data back to our communities * The accounts get locked again... I'm done talking to alvro at this point so I reach out to 1fichier, they tell me the original account owner complained so they locked the accounts * Another week or so go by and it turns out 1fichier staff lied to me, they didn't lock the accounts they just gave alvro the accounts back for a 3rd time and blacklisted my email addresses So, that's where we are today, AlvRo wasted the time of myself and at least 30 other people that were involved in this mess. Alvro is now back posting his adfly laden links from his google sheet again. So today is when I said fuck that noise, let's just host the whole lot without ads and the hoops to jump through getting them from alvro or 1fichier. Our initial release here is to see how it goes, the full set is 132TB today we're releasing the first 82TB, should this project be well received we wil continue to add larger datasets over time, thanks for reading, enjoy the rest of your weekend! **Community** ----- You can reach me [here]( on reddit, in the [r/DataHoarder IRC]( (GreenObsession) or on [our discord server.]( Come chat to everyone, see our new content before anyone else and join other like minds. **Supporting Us** ----- ^If ^you ^like ^what ^we ^do ^consider ^donating ^towards ^our ^server ^costs. ^$600.00/month ^covers ^all ^of ^our ^service ^costs. * ^BTC: ^3Mem5B2o3Qd2zAWEthJxUH28f7itbRttxM * [^PayPal]("}

I have a great deal of content I'd love to share, and nearly all of it can be obtained for free and legit elsewhere anyway, but T&Cs often say it can't be mirrored so I've never bothered.

Although they had no key or anything aside what was on the computer, the distribution of the DVD, even though it was free, was down as piracy I believe, and they were done like \u00a3250,000 for it. Quite a few companies are assholes, where even though the only -legit- way to use any of this is by paying them money for licenses, they still don't want people to share the media itself. It's a shame because I believe I'd have some rarer stuff to offer also, but I don't want to open my servers up with that content, when I've got it legally for myself, but sharing is a no-no. Maybe I'm worrying too much. I just want to share what I can, \"properly\" if you get me."}

This is by design so their drives don't fill up from ease of right click access. The way to work around this is with rclone. Rclone can do it using the following command. rclone copy GDrive:/SharedFolderName GDrive:/MyDestinationFolder/ -v -P --drive-shared-with-me The **--drive-shared-with-me** flag will do the server side copy. Make sure you right click and add the shared folder to your drive too or rclone won't see it. Then you have an actual copy on your local gdrive. Beware you're still subject to the 750GB daily limit."}

The little image that helps you out when seeking doesn't have to be HD when it's shown in a tiny little square. My thumbnails take ~70mb **per video** max, and I've never even once thought \"those don't look as good as the ones on Netflix\". All that said, it looks as though what I was thinking to be the thumbnails was in fact an image sequence of the film and not the thumbnail data.

ERP measures the combination of the power emitted by the transmitter and the ability of the antenna to direct that power in a given direction.

The Boscone (Boston SF event) event was 4 months later. Card was the featured speaker. We snuck in and through pure luck caught him toward the end of a \"hospitality\": meet the author in a conference room with big table, the food 80% gone by the time we got there. Honest to Dog he was sitting by himself at a table, not even talking to anyone. My son excitedly told him about us read-walking Ender's Game and others joining us because they love the book so much. Card responded with the tale of him reading the last Harry Potter book to his family at an airport, the day it came out. Eventually he was orating to about 70 people. *That's* the memory of Card that I don't want to taint. :) Please don't reply with \"*Here* is the dirt on Card.\""}

They are *usually* unsecured due to the owner/hosts lack of security know how. Us downloading from them? - you're getting data from something that is unsecured and insecure. The person running it probably isn't aware of the breach until our traffic (hug of death or close to) causes them issues. It is safe to say that most media you can get on an OD (music/films/series etc.) is readily available via torrent, on usenet or just by streaming (either legally or illegally). If you live in a restrictive country & can afford it - use a vpn service. I live in Australia, don't genrally use a vpn and have download probably petabyes (or close to!) of data over the years and never once had any interaction with the authorities. As to the data itself - **NEVER EVER RUN RANDOM EXECUTABLES (exe, apk, sit etc.) DOWNLOADED FROM OD'S ON A SYSTEM YOU WANT TO BE SECURE** & if you *must*, treat that system as compromised. As media files are *generally* **NOT** executable you should have no issues. *All italics probably indicate caveats*"}

When the \u201choly grail\u201d (farfarawaysite.com) vanished, it was a wake-up call. Copyright takedowns, neglect, server rot\u2014these resources can disappear at any time. I regretted not scraping it when I could, and didn\u2019t want it to happen again. **If you\u2019ve browsed fan galleries for TV shows, movies, or celebrities, odds are you\u2019ve used a Coppermine site\u2014almost every major fanpage is powered by it (sometimes with heavy customizations).** If you\u2019ve tried scraping Coppermine galleries, you know most tools: * **Don\u2019t work at all** (Coppermine\u2019s structure, referer protection, anti-hotlinking break them) * **Or just dump the entire site**\u2014thumbnails, junk files, no album structure. **INTRODUCING: COPPERMINER** A desktop tool to recursively download full-size images from any Coppermine-powered gallery. * **GUI:** Paste any gallery root or album URL\u2014no command line needed * **Smart discovery:** Only real albums (skips \u201cmost viewed,\u201d \u201crandom,\u201d etc) * **Original images only:** No thumbnails, no previews, no junk * **Preserves folder structure:** Downloads images into subfolders matching the gallery * **Intelligent caching:** Site crawls are cached and refreshed only if needed\u2014massive speedup for repeat runs * **Adaptive scraping:** Handles custom Coppermine themes, paginated albums, referer/anti-hotlinking, and odd plugins * **Mimic human mode:** (optional) Randomizes download order/timing for safer, large scrapes * **Dark mode:** Save your eyes during late-night hoarding sessions * **Windows double-click ready:** Just run `start_gallery_ripper.bat` * **Free, open-source, non-commercial** (CC BY-NC 4.0) **WHAT IT DOESN\u2019T DO** * Not a generic website ripper\u2014**Coppermine only** * No junk: skips previews, thumbnails, \u201cspecial\u201d albums * \u201cSelect All\u201d chooses real albums only (not \u201cmost viewed,\u201d etc) **HOW TO USE** *(more detailed description in the github repo)* * Clone/download: [ * Install Python 3.10+ if needed * Run the app and paste any Coppermine gallery root URL * Click \u201cDiscover,\u201d check off albums, hit download * Images are organized exactly like the website\u2019s album/folder structure **BUGS & EDGE CASES** This is a brand new release coded overnight. It works on all Coppermine galleries I tested\u2014including some heavily customized ones\u2014but there are probably edge cases I haven\u2019t hit yet. **Bug reports, edge cases, and testing on more Coppermine galleries are highly appreciated!** If you find issues or see weird results, please report or PR.

As far as downloading - >1 of us searches for and finds an OD >this is **an unsecured web or file server**, the owner or host has either left it open because they don't know apache/ngix server security or because they want it open for anyone to download from. either way they can get your IP address from the server logs.

A lot are probably dead by now, many wouldn't have got past reddit's wordfilters (based on links I have posted previously that **haven't** got past the wordfilters) and many more that I suspect might have Personally Identifiable Information. I do have a separate encrypted (not cleartext) file of ods I've found that specifically I have found to have PII. Is there a link in the list that specifically gives you pause? Or is it the volume of the list - I specifically posts lists as I don't want to bump other posts down the front page by posting 1 by 1. **EDIT:** I have to be honest - someone who hasn't really contributed to this sub complaining about relevant content being posted here and getting validation for it kinda reinforces to me my post from last week."}

I may as well add it to the metaphorical pile with those other ones . Yeah, true that about usenet, having it good to go is far too convenient an option. I haven't touched that at all since finally chucking my old desktop, when I finally got some entirely new hardware for the first time in (what seemed like) an eternity at that point... But usually any content that I happen to think about is good enough for me to find on the old public trackers these days. Too right about taking a while for some of that older stuff at times though - I'm the same when it comes to the option of private trackers instead. I have to admit that I really just cannot be bothered anymore, dealing with all the kerfuffle that comes with them. But I now have Wicked City currently transferring at the moment at a decent speed, so I might say hello to Mrs Spider again tonight lol if I don't have an early night xD"}

The network has no fast way to find out if an URL is available or not and the UI doesn't communicate what is going on. So there is a lot of \"doesn't work\" and you have no idea what or why. Another issues is that IPFS doesn't automatically spread content across the network like the old Freenet, so the speed will depend on whatever device the providing IPFS server runs, which might be a RaspberryPi half the time.

Yes bandwidth can still be an issue, but the way it works by default is just like with torrents. The pieces that someone has downloaded from one or more hosts are available to upload to other downloaders as well, temporarily increasing the capacity. Gateways are another thing, they are a single point in the network which can cause issues, the benefit of gateways are mostly to give access to people who can either not run a node themselves to access the network or want to access over But they are not required for the network to function.

It was in a >DUBL folder which I'm guessing means exactly that - dubbed. Final EDIT: Can confirm that >/SoftSub/ folders (for Whitehouse Plumbers at least) had 1 English audio track and farsi(?) subtitles."}
