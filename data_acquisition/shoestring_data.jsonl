Try Blablacar - It\u2019s like couch surfing for car rides and is a GREAT way to meet people at your next destination & practice some real-ass Spanish/Catalan/Basque/etc. language skills. It\u2019s usually pretty cheap and you just basically say \u201cI\u2019m looking to go from city X to city Y sometime between these dates\u201d and people will contact you who are doing the same. 2.) If you\u2019re in a smaller city, or a city with shitty/expensive hostel, or just want to not stay in a 16-person dorm for a night, try Couchsurfing & Airbnb. Usually the people are super nice and will either help you find things to do, or even want to go with you! In addition, it\u2019s almost always cool to go hang out at a hostel even if you\u2019re not a guest there. The lifeblood of hostels is often their environment, and they don\u2019t mind you helping to improve it. 3.) With both 1.) & 2.) in mind; PLEASE go to places that you\u2019ve never heard of. Places that aren\u2019t on Rick Steves or whatever the fuck. Take a chance on missing a bus to follow your interest & instinct. Spain is a country of very expressive & often generous people, although they don\u2019t often exude these traits to strangers or in public. Some of my best experiences were in very rural areas of Andalusia where the bus routes ended and I had to kinda chance it to get the last few miles to my destination. I remember sitting in a cafe realizing that I might have to walk the 8 miles to get to that farm I was visiting & just happened to mention it to the owner behind the counter. Within 5 minutes he had helped me strike up a conversation with another patron who lived in that town and was heading home within the hour. The drive turned out to be an unforgettable memory; an intermediate Spanish speaker & an older gentleman with a STRONG rural Andalusian accent laughing & learning, all because of my mistake, a cup of coffee, and the kindness of strangers. If you go in with your eyes open you\u2019re bound to have an amazing time. Spain is a beautiful country, and once you learn the quirks, you\u2019ll have a hard time saying goodbye in the end. Feel free to DM me if you want to chat further, best of luck!"}

We tracked every penny we spent and tried to stick to a budget of $37.50 per day, per person ($75 per day combined). Ultimately, we went over that by almost $10 per day. We tried to do as much as we could on a budget and prioritized meeting new people (especially locals) and seeing obscure places over comfort. **The photos and numbers include every $ spent (yes including flights). EVERY $ SPENT!** **THIS IS JUST ONE PERSONS SPEND.** MY PARTNER HAS HER OWN DATA THAT LOOKS SIMILAR! 2022 was spent primarily in Eastern Europe and the Balkans. Countries Visited in order: Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia, Croatia, Bosnia & Herzegovina, Serbia, Romania, Moldova, Transnistria, Bulgaria, North Macedonia, Kosovo, Montenegro, Ireland, Czechia, Austria, Slovenia, Albania, Greece, Cyprus, France. 2023:traveled across asia from Japan to the Caucasus Mountains Countries visited in order: Japan, Taiwan, Vietnam, Laos, Thailand, Myanmar, Cambodia, Brunei, Malaysia, China, Mongolia, South Korea, Qatar, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Armenia. 2024: South America through Central America and Mexico Countries visited in order: Chile(Santiago and Patagonia), Argentina, Uruguay, Brazil, Paraguay, Bolivia, Chile (Atacama Desert), Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Panama, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Belize, Mexico. We found that we needed a \u201cQuest\u201d ,something that would pull us away from touristy areas and in turn guide us towards seeing the more \u201creal\u201d parts of a country. This ended up being a lofty goal of trying to visit every UNESCO World Heritage Site. This quest ended up giving us some of our most memorable travel experiences, not because of the UNESCO sites themselves, but because of the places we traveled through to reach the sites. We met locals who never see tourists and in turn we had some amazing interactions and made wonderful friends along the way. I am happy to answer questions about the budget, destinations, travel tips or strategy. Cheers and see you on the road!"}

Buses break down, buses don't show up, things wont go according to your plan. Be ok with that, its part of the journey. 3) Staying in hostels and eating local food are the biggest ways to save money. We stayed in a hilton for 4 nights in China because I had points, i felt like a KING! 4) Try and meet the people of the countries they will help you and they will be the thing you remember most! I love Taiwan, in my opinion it has the best food in the world! Taiwan feels like you smashed the far east and the west together and it just works! The people are also incredibly friendly! We did not work remotely. It may shock people but we don't make much money off social media. We treat social media like a big video diary that we will be able to look back on one day. One of our YouTube shorts got 37 million views, that paid us like $4000. Besides that we have not made much money on social media."}

Qatar was a layover. Spent 12 hours cruising around Doha with Pakastani guy we met on couchsurfing. He was a great dude. Picked us up at the airport at 6am, drove us all over the city and the dropped us back off at 6pm. My girlfriends parents were vacationing in Ireland so we met them there and traveled with them to Prague and Vienna. Flew from Cyprus to Paris to spend 4 nights before flying back to Los Angeles. I had never been to Paris. We returned home between each \"trip\" Usually for a month or two for the holidays. I don't know if I would call it \"problems\" adjusting but now that I know what else is out there I want to live abroad. I always have to an extent but now that I have lived abroad and kind of \"done my research\" of finding places that really resonate with me it is something I am actively pursuing. The novelty of \"omg travel is amazing no work all fun everything is perfect\" wears off around 4-5 months. Don't get me wrong, it is still an amazing life. I am lucky to have a partner to share it with. Emotionally difficult? I am not sure? I have gone through phases of loving every second of that bus being broken on the side of the road because 'hey at least I am not in a cubicle'. To if I have to talk to another random hostel dweller about \"my story\" again I may lose my mind. And every emotion in between. I will say its much more enjoyable to go slow and stay in one place longer than it is to travel travel travel. I loved the highs and lows and wouldn't trade the experience for anything. 99.9% of people are good. They are curious about you the same way you are about them. I have been helped by strangers in the most generous ways imaginable. People who have the least give the most. You get out of life what you put into it. This was a dream of mine until I decided I didn't want it to be a dream anymore. Go see the world and meet the people and then you can decide how you feel about it. Don't let people decide for you."}

Yet despite this myself and many others are yet to get sick, even though we have taken countless flights. This is compounded by the fact that - whilst yes, asymptomatic transmission is possible - it is way less likely. This notion was corroborated by Maria Van Kerkhove, who heads the World Health Organization\u2019s emerging diseases and zoonoses unit. She said that \u201casymptomatic cases are definitely not a major driver of transmission\u201d."}

The chances that a good amount of the other passengers have contracted it from that one guy is high. There is so much that even experts don\u2019t know or understand about this virus, so it\u2019s best to go with what we know for sure and take precautions based of off what we know. That being said, if you want to put yourself and others at risk, that\u2019s up to you.

Dresden, Prague, Berlin, Copenhagen, Basel, Paris, Amsterdam one summer; Basel, London, Cornwall, Brighton, Glasgow, den Haag, Rotterdam, Bern, Zurich, Budapest; London, Paris, Geneva, Interlaken, Barcelona, Tangier (reduced ferry cost), Torino. Just off the top of my head. I took advantage on my last year of <26 and asked for a 1st class Interrail pass as a gift. When I checked, just the price of travelling from Oban in Scotland to London was worth the price of the 10 day Interrail ticket if bought on the day. Not to mention the freakin nice meals I got on the train as part of the ticket price in France and so on. Next summer I interrailed in second class starting from Scotland again, all the way to Morocco. Had only trips of 6+ hours on each travel day, the longest being around 18 hours. I used car sharing or buses for shorter stretches, (or crossing the channel into France) if need be. What I'm trying to say is that it can be worth it. Especially with the changes they brought to the passes, the fact that you can use it out of two months instead of just one now is amazing! It means you get to take longer breaks in-between travel days and really explore a place more thoroughly, as well as having the option, if you want to cut on costs, to go for the option of more changes and avoid the western fast trains that are the ones reservation costs actually sting on. Reservation costs do add up, of course. But I took the night train from Prague, for example, and that was cheaper or about as much as a night in a hostel. In most central and eastern countries reservations are really cheap (friend went from Bucharest to Budapest for 20 euros in a 4 bed sleeper just a few days ago, there being a 6 beds option for less). That's a 16 hour train ride! And the scenery you sometimes get to witness is worth it, since you get a better feel of the country. I for one took the Glacier and Bernina express multiple times on return trips just because of how much I loved those views (reservations are dirt cheap as far as I remember a.i less than 5 franks, especially for Switzerland)"}

Very, very wrong. You can explore LA using just public transit, and it\u2019s much easier and more expansive than most people realize. Los Angeles has a network of trains, buses, and shuttles that connect many of the city\u2019s top destinations. All you need is a TAP Card. They cost $2, and you load them with money then just tap as you board. You can take the FlyAway Bus from LAX to Unions Station for $9.75. The transit hub of Los Angeles is downtown with four major Metro rail lines - the A, B, D, and E lines. These trains converge at Union Station and 7th Street Metro Center, making them very easy to find. By taking JUST ONE OF THESE TRAINS you can get to most major destinations. Like: * Santa Monica, to see the beach, the Pier and the 3rd Street Promenade (downtown Santa Monica Station) * Hollywood, to see the Walk of Fame, Hollywood Bowl, Runyon Canyon, Jumbo\u2019s Clown Room, and of course the Hollywood Sign (various stations) * Universal City, to see Universal Studios Hollywood (Universal City Station) * Downtown Civic Center, to see the Walt Disney Concert Hall, Broad Museum, and Grand Park (Civic Center Station) * Historic Core, to see The Last Bookstore, Angels Flight Railway, and Grand Central Market (Pershing Square Station) * Pasadena, to see the Rose Bowl, Oldtown, Tournament of Roses Parade, Pasadena Playouse, The Huntington Museum and Gardens (various stations) * South Pasadena, to see houses from Halloween and Back to the Future (South PAsadena Station) * Arcadia, to see Santa Anita Park and an old-school In-N-Out (Arcadia Station) * Long Beach, to see the Queen Mary and Waterfront (Downtown Long Beach Station) * North Hollywood, to see the NoHo Arts District and TV ACADEMY NAME(North Hollywood Station) * Culver City, to see their Arts District and Museum of Jurassic Technology * Exposition Park in downtown, to see Staples Center (Crypto.com Arena) (Pico Station) * The other Exposition Park (yes we have 2 for some reason), to see the Coliseum, the Bank, the ScienCenter, the Rose Garden, and the Lucas Museum (Exposition Park Station) * Highland Park, to see cute shops and cafes on Fig and York (Highland Park Station) * Silver Lake, to see hip shops and cafes on Sunset (Vermont/Santa Monica Station) * The Arts District, to see expensive shops and cafes in industrial buildings (LIttle Tokyo/Arts District Station) * Watts, to see the iconic Watts Towers (Watts Station) * Little Tokyo, for Japanese food and fun (Little Tokyo/Arts District Station) * Koreatown, for Korean food and fun, and the historic Wiltern (various stations) * Olvera Street, for Mexican food and fun (Union Station) * Mariachi Plaza, for\u2026 more Mexican food and fun (Mariachi Plaza station) * Boyle Heights, for\u2026 even more Mexican food and fun (Mariachi Plaza station) * Chinatown, for food, music, bars and State Historic Park (Chinatown Station) * And Compton, to see\u2026 Compton, I guess. (Artesia Station) Again, those are all ONE TRAIN RIDE away- no transferring necessary. And only $3.50 roundtrip. # Want to see more? While not all of Los Angeles is connected by one train, other lines fill in the gaps. All you need to do is transfer to another bus or train, and use the same TAP card. Transfers on most lines are free. That means the fare you already paid covers the cost of your transfer. You don\u2019t pay anything additional- just use the same TAP card. **So where can you get to by other lines?** * West Hollywood, to see the Sunset Strip and Santa Monica Blvd. party scene (Line 2 Bus) * Beverly Hills, to see Rodeo Drive and houses you could never afford (Line 4 Bus) * Venice Beach and Marina Del Rey, to see the beachfront (Line 3 Bus) * The Grifith Observatory (Dash Shuttle) * Miracle Mile, to see Museum Row and The Grove (Lines 20/720 Bus) * Century City, to see Nakatomi Plaza (Line 4 Bus) * Inglewood (K Line Train) * SoFi Stadium and the YouTube Theater (C Line Train) * Dodger Stadium, to catch a game (Dodger Stadium Express Bus @ Union Station) * San Pedro (J Line- additional fare required)"}

At Tower City you can also transfer to the Blue and Green lines (more of a light rail), which can take you to the lakefront and some of the attractions there (baseball stadium, science museum, USS Cod museum). There's also a few decent BRT lines that you can use to reach places like AsiaTown. Granted the city is a bit hollowed-out and if you're there too long you'll definitely miss having a car, but for a few days of sightseeing I think you could cover most of your bases with just transit."}

You can enjoy the large park in the center of Boston, explore a small intersting chinatown - go to little Italy and get amazing pizza. There are boats out to some state parks that are islands 8 miles out with huge WW2 gun emplacements and with a HUGE historical fort built in the 1800s. There is a ton of history in Boston, in the city itself. Summer is so nice outside and in any place natural. Fall is really amazing with the leaves. In the winter you can go to a huge lake and walk on the late - really nice if there is no snow. (edit: I guess it's too warm now to do this. sadge). One of the best things to do in Boston is just wander around, find a cafe and hang out, look at a bookstore and small stores. Harvard square is a nice place to hang out and has a nice river near it, and Harvard university. Boston has a vibe, go to experience the vibe. Legal Seafood is a great restaurant and other seafood places. You can get lobster rolls. Boston isn't a food place on the level of NYC or SF, but there is great food there if you find it. Indian, ethiopian, italian, chinese, etc. See a game at Fenway park, see the red sox or Celtics. Go to the excellent symphony. Or see classical music in another place. Listen to live music in a small bar."}

I will layout some tips I guess though that help me. 1. If you know nothing else. Know this. BOOK EARLY!!!. This is probably a simple fact that most people know but please don't wait for 2 weeks before to book flights. Prices tend only to go up. As the date nears, more people who are booking tickets tend to be business travelers and thus are not paying for the tickets themselves and thus airlines can charge a ton of money. 2. Be flexible. The summer tends to be expensive so travel on the off season. Friday nights are the most expensive, Tuesday and Thursdays tend to be the cheapest days of the week. 3. Know alternate airports. For SF, think OAK and SJC. For NYC, think SWF, EWR, JFK, LGA, ISP, HPN. For Miami, think FLL, MIA, PBI. Google what airports are close to your destination. 4. Know the \"Southwest Effect\". [ Southwest was the original low cost airline and thus the term stuck but this refers to any low cost airline airline that enters a route, and drops airfare for every airline. For example, Norwegian airlines has been drooping fares across the Atlantic for the past few years. Hawaii was also very cheap recently because of the Southwest effect. 5. Plan ahead If you want to get the best deal possible start getting a top 3 destinations in mind that you want to go to about \\~9-6 months ahead of time. Then figure out what would be a good air fare to the country. Then lurk on websites such as a [theflightdeal]( until a fare appears. What makes a good air fare? 6. As I have said. ITA, theflightdeal, Hopper, Momondo, Google Flights and Kayak, KIWI ( typically great for more IDK where to go moments) are great sites. 7. The following should be goals. ie they appear maybe once a month. * East Coast -> Europe: Cheapest Ever: \\~$160->$250 RT Realistic: Low 300s RT (Cheapest destinations right now in order from cheapest to more expensive: Dublin, Barcelona, Paris, London.) * West Coast -> Europe: Cheapest Ever: \\~$250 RT Realistic: Mid 300s RT * West Coast -> Asia: Cheapest Ever: \\~$High 300s, Realistic: Mid 400s RT * West Coast -> Asia: Cheapest Ever: \\~$ 400, Realistic: Mid 500s RT * Transcon: Cheapest Ever/realistic: low 200s RT. Vegas and Seattle tend to be 200 even sometimes from the east coast. * NE -> Florida: Cheapest ever: $60 RT: Realistic Mid 100s * Australia: \\~$800s?"}

There's a free museum of perfume, near the Opera, they technically try to get you to buy something at the end since the museum is run by a perfume brand haha but it's not required. Definitely walk around the Latin Quarter and check out the arene de Lutece, this is a nice spot for people watching as well. Nearby there is a crepe place called Oroyona, they have a good deal for 5.50 EUR until 8pm, sweet + savory crepe and a drink.

Once at 26 and again at 36. I never eat at restaurants... They're expensive and a waste of time. I hit street stalls, grocery stores, and enjoy my 'moveable feast' as I walk from place to place. I DO love museums. And I thoroughly enjoyed every minute in the Louvre (and remember... It was like, the King's HOUSE!) and the Orsay. And when I was there, they had an after-hours tribute to Django Reinhardt at the Paris Museum of Music. That was free! And... I found out about it when I was bending over tying my shoes! The event was advertised on a concert poster in a music store window. So don't ignore posters and flyers in bookstores, etc. As a solo traveler, you will be open to experiences that a couple wouldn't be. Good for you! Open container laws are pretty lax. I bought a splint of fizzy wine and toasted the sunset at Sacre Couer. But beat feet fast!! It's not a GREAT neighborhood after dark. Also, hit up all the street markets. During the early morning, there's almost always one in every neighborhood. In fact, one time, I went to see the catacombs and for whatever reason (the French!) it was closed. But I hardly even cared because I bought a bunch of fresh radishes and ate them as I wandered through a street produce market. Over ten years later, but still feel wistful and nostalgic thinking about how much I loved those spicy, crunchy lil things. And day trips! Take them. The trains are so easy to navigate. France is actually, surprisingly small. If you can't get a refund on ANY of your accommodations (sorry!). But if you can... A day ride to Mont St Michele. Or the D-day beaches. Or... Haha. Brugge! For night life, live music is always okay to go alone. Most people are facing the stage anyway. And being alone isn't necessarily lonely... DO you knit or crochet? Maybe you have time to learn. It passes the time, you can make yourself a memorable kerchief or bandana... And all the nicest people (usually women) may approach you to say HI. Knitters are very nice people and generally not to sketch. Hope that helps. Happy travels!"}

Don't run to catch a metro, there will be another one in a few minutes and the beeping noise the doors make when they close is terrifying. Get galettes and cider in one of the cr\u00eaperies along Rue du Montparnasse. Wander along the street and see which menu appeals to you. If you go to the rooftop of Galeries Lafayette Paris Haussmann you get an amazing view of the city. The building itself is also beautiful. \u00cele aux Cygnes is a little park on an island in the Seine, it's nice for a walk or to read and have a picnic. You can see the Eiffel Tower and there's a mini Statue of Liberty. Large tips are not expected, 5% is good. Even if you speak a little French people will probably respond in English, don't be offended. Boat tours at night are really fun, they're not that cheap but if you time it right you'll go right past the Eiffel Tower while it's lit up. Eat many many pastries, they're amazing. Also try some cheeses if you like them. I like Saint-Marcellin and Comt\u00e9, they're mild and delicious on some crusty bread. If you have a kindle or iPad, bring some good books and lounge in the various beautiful spots taking in the atmosphere. I'll edit my comment if I think of anything else!"}

You can ask for \"un piece de...\" and show how big with your fingers. FYI always say bonjour on entering the shop, and you're not allowed to touch fruit before you buy it. You can also get little mini wine bottles for like \u20ac2 for a posh picnic :) Coffee to go is less of a thing, but when you are ready to rest your feet, \u20ac2-5 gets you a coffee or glass of wine at a pavement cafe. A drink at a Tabac is the cheapest option I think. Prixe fixe/ plat du jour menu in a bistro around \u20ac15-25 for 2/3 courses. \"Le Cafe Gourmand\" is an espresso and a sampler plate of the days desserts in a cafe, highly recommended for an afternoon treat. Browse Shakespeare and Co., pick up a book in English to keep you company. 59 Rivoli is a bohemian artist commune/ open studios which is free to enter, many of the artists sell postcards or have tip jars (cash only). You have lots of time to explore away from the centre where things are a bit cheaper and less touristy.

You can also go to the Pere Lachaise, it\u2019s a cemetery with a lot of famous people buried there, it\u2019s \u201cseen\u201d in one of the fantastic beasts movies as well (even though it wasn\u2019t filmed there) and the new Daryl Dixon tv show. I recommend as well going to a supermarket and buying a bottle of wine, some snacks and sitting by the seine, a lot of Parisian people do that it\u2019s very pleasant. Not as nice as Versailles but it\u2019s free, you can always go to Saint Germain en Laye and walk in the park/ forest. You can also see Paris from the gardens. There\u2019s also the castle where Louis XIV was born (the king who built Versailles), not sure if you can go in or if it\u2019s free as I haven\u2019t been in years but it\u2019s gorgeous from the outside. Don\u2019t hesitate to take a stroll in the city center, you might also go to the march\u00e9 there if you\u2019re going on Tuesday, Friday or Sunday morning (before 1pm). You\u2019ll be able to buy some fruits veggies and meat as well as objects, clothes and all, usually pretty cheap."}

Try going 1-2 metro spots after a touristic place to find reasonable prices. You can also install the app \u00ab MisterGoodBeer \u00bb to find cheap bars. Even if you don\u2019t drink, it\u2019ll give you an idea of the prices in the area (the \u00ab Prix de la pinte \u00bb is almost a unit of measurement) - Like lots of people suggested, you can ride Velibs (Parisian bikes) for a few euros and there are stations everywhere, just make sure to have the app installed and not ride above the time limit. Lime is also a good option. Biking around the Seine is amazing, especially during the sunset! - My favorite neighbourhood is the 12th arrondissement, especially around Jardin de Reuilly and Coul\u00e9e Verte which is a pedestrian road above the streets which goes from Bastille to Bois de Vincennes. You can also go to Place Aligre where there are affordable restaurants, and the Rue du Faubourg Saint Antoine (the part near Bastille) is also a great place to eat / drink / shop, - If you can cook in your accommodation, it will definitely be cheaper. Lidl, Aldi and Intermarch\u00e9 are the cheapest supermarkets, Monoprix and Franprix are overpriced. If you can\u2019t cook, most supermarkets have a \u00ab traiteur \u00bb area where you can buy all the things you need for picnics, and any boulangerie will provide good bread and sandwiches for less than 10\u20ac if you\u2019re on the go. - To meet people for free, try the app Meetup. There are picnics or drinks organised almost everyday, you just have to pay for your food and drinks. If you\u2019re into jazz you can also check out \u00ab La Gare le Gore \u00bb, there are jazz concerts everyday, where you pay what you want. You can check out their instagram for more info. It also turns into a techno club at midnight. - Right now and until September the fan zones for the Olympics are still here, one per arrondissement. There will be activities in each zone everyday, you can check on the official Olympics app. I hope you\u2019ll have a lot of fun in Paris, don\u2019t let your ex ruin a wonderful trip!"}

Take photographs and it's generally good weather at this time of year. There are decent parks and things too. There are some really good small cafes for coffee and croissants. And i still remember a hot dog i had in a park in paris that was better than any delux sausage ive had anywhere since (including germany) Try to ask for things in French. I only had a few days of duolingo, and even though everyone replied In english the vast majority obviously appreciated me at least trying. If your hotel has a mini fridge stock up on food from supermarkets. And ask to box up any leftovers at restaurants. One thing I would save money for are taxis at night though. Paris is one city that is not safe to walk around at night as women (Unlike many other European cities! Ive been to barcelona, madrid, dublin, belfast, lived in many parts of the uk, amsterdam, finland, munich, prague, budapest and more. And paris was the most only city I felt completely unsafe on the streets outside of india) Also make sure you're dressed in good heels for any night clubs or spots. The French really are particular on their fashion! But the dressing up really can be fun!"}

I have been by myself and found the younger shop or cafe staff in cool areas love to chat in English to tourists. Older folks not so much they refuse to speak English and can be rude. It feels less lonely when you have interactions during the day. Always say bonjour when entering a shop or they will think you are rude. The cemetery where famous people are buried is free and cool. I think the 97 bus goes there which is a hack to a paid bus tour as it goes through lots of picturesque areas but without the commentary or tourists. Monoprix is fun and like target in the USA but much better quality clothes and more fashionable. Many different locations but some better than others. Always go there to get stuff to bring home. Canal and Marais area are where cool locals hang out - younger hipper vibe. Cool shops and restaurants. More relaxed to just wander. If into fashion there is a Dior museum that looks fun but was lined up too long when I went. Enjoy!!"}

OP probably searched for the same flight 2 or 3 times on his desktop, but searched for it once on his tablet. There is a psychological effect of wanting something more (something you already know you want, a flight somewhere specific) that if you feel like the price is going to continue to go up, that it might \"slip out of your grasp\" if the price becomes too high. So using this, airlines raise the price of a ticket when 1) you've searched for it multiple times and 2) you're on the same device. TLDR Basically airlines are playing Jedi mind tricks. And clear your cookies when searching for flights multiple times. And Google flights is your friend (except Southwest doesn't release their flights to Google).

Here are my personal lessons learned for saving/making money, tips and strategies on how to go for a long time, or forever. Hope it helps!", "content": "Hey r/Shoestring, I wish I found this sub before I'd left but all's well that ends well. I saved a great amount, and figured out ways to extend my backpacking trip pretty much forever. This thread is for the best bits of a [blog I wrote here]( the full blog is long and needs to have the contents page so I've left it there if you want to check it. Otherwise, these are my absolute best tips, and I'm sure others have more experience so please put your tips down in the comments! Enjoy! * **Ditch the check-in luggage and go carry-on only.** 7kg (15.4lbs) of clothes and accessories in a 40L bag is all you need. Seriously, the ladies like to say its because I'm a guy, but I've seen plenty of female backpackers do this too.*Hot Tip:* Packing cubes are life savers, and [this Osprey Bag]( is by far the best investment I made for this trip. It has the perfect dimensions for airlines to not tear me a new one. I saved $500+ on baggage fees. * **Get a travel card that re-reimburses ATM fees.** For Australia, ING Bank has a card that will re-reimburse all foreign ATM fees, I\u2019ve heard of similar ones for the UK and US. In fact there was a thread on one [for the UK on this sub a few days ago]( Because I didn\u2019t do this, I had a nice *\u201c$I don\u2019t want to even calculate\u201d* total fee at the end. * **Use** [**Skyscanner\u2019s**]( **price chart to compare flights, use** [**Rome2Rio**]( **for land travel comparisons.** You can compare prices by day/month, get cheap flights to gems you didn't even know about. Don\u2019t use travel agents if you like money. * **Work in guesthouses/hostels and teach English for free accommodation and travel money.** These are some of the easiest ways to practically travel forever, all you have to do is ask. And if you speak English and are social, you\u2019ve got the job. This is one of the ways you can chill in a city/town/area you like for slightly longer term. It won't make you rich but man does it offset life for the cost of 2-3 hours a day. * **Teach English/German/French on your terms** \\- There's high demand, especially in Asia for English teachers, and you can set up a job for yourself so you can work remotely usually teaching Chinese students, but you've got plenty of access to other opportunities. And no you don't need to know the other language. [Job listing are here.]( [I go into more tips and advice on this in this section.]( * **Sign up to** [**Trusted House Sitters**]( **or** [**Mind My House**]( \\- These services let you get free accommodation by house sitting for other people. You can get to see some pretty cool places, just by sitting for people. Couchsurfing is also good for free accommodation. I'm sure a lot of you are well versed in all of this, but these are discoveries I made for myself and thought I'd share in case it'd help with anyone's upcoming trips! Feel free to ask any questions too! Not an expert but I've learned quite a bit :) &#x200B; Thanks, Sah"}

Like spending a crazy amount by buying a Tomorrowland Ticket and going nuts over a week. But when I was following these principles my expenses/break-even were pretty much Nil in Asia, and maybe ran me a 300-400 in Western Europe, 200-300 in Eastern Europe for 1 week. Australian dollars. But don\u2019t look at those figures too much because certain things would heavily affect that, like not being able to volunteer in France, and lots of popular cities charging insane amounts for hostels stays. Some weeks were cheap liking camping across Poland, and some weeks got relatively expensive, being in the heart of London. I\u2019ll need to sit and crunch the numbers. Because I don\u2019t know how much I spent overall, as my money would keep topping up towards a neutral balance as I spent and made more. The more I stayed in places for longer, the cheaper it would be. I would get free board in places for 2-3 hours of work, I\u2019d be making a small amount from my blogs on Medium every month, and I had the option to be doing some freelance work.

So I\u2019ll give some context. My favourite part about travel is food, and I do like cities. So keep that in mind. 1. Bangkok, Thailand - people will usually only stay here for a bit and ditch it to go to the islands or other places but I love it. Lots of amazing food markets, there's something always going on in terms of nightlife, its such a hub in terms of work and travel if that's what you're looking for. 1. Hanoi, Vietnam - Amazing old french architecture, great food culture, the pub street is lively, and definitely hit up the old quarter on the weekend for some wholesome fun. Very close to other top attractions like Ha Long Bay and Sapa - North Vietnam in general is crazy good. 1. Pai + Chiang Mai Thailand - Very relaxed, cheaper to stay and perfect locations of the Thai New Year if that's something you're interested in doing. 1. George Town, Penang, Malaysia - A lot to do, very relaxed, lots to eat and you're basically on the doorstep of South Thailand if you want to move that way. 1. Hoi An, Vietnam - Beautiful little town, rent a bike and explore, you've got the beach if you want it, you've got the culture, it's a perfect place. There's many more, and if you're more into beaches, do the Islands on Thailand east coast, do Koh Rong in Cambodia maybe. These are definitely well established places in SE Asia circuits, so you'll find them easy to do! Hope that helps!"}

And that any money I made during my travels, for instance, my Medium blog (~$500 month), I'd get it deposited into that account, and top up the rest of the required minimum from money I already have in a separate account. I will say that Citibank is also very good for a travel card. All in all, I've found the very best way to avoid all of this, is to carry a sizable amount of USD with you during travelling, and that gets you some of the best rates you can get, with obviously no ATM fees.

I wouldn't waltz into a school and try to find a job without a visa permit and that's definitely not what I'm advocating for. And also another point, no, a lot of these certifications to teach can indeed be done online and the employing body will usually cover it all and organize for you to move to the location to commence work with a visa that they'll help you apply for - some of these programs are indeed quite good. However, volunteering in a hostel for board, food etc. although might be walking the line, I'm absolutely recommending that regardless of visa's. I don't believe I'm giving anyone a bad name, and I think more good is coming from it than harm. Hostels get free workers to cater for their audience in terms of language, and are able to thrive. And on those terms I respectfully disagree. For everything else like remote English teaching, you need to look up the tax laws and treaties with your country, the country you're providing the service in and the country you're providing the service to. If I'm from Australia, teaching English online to Chinese students, but I'm doing it in Thailand - there's rules around that - It's the travelers responsibility to look them up, or ignore them as they see fit. I really do see where you're coming from, so I did want to clarify (like I have above) that officially teaching English in a country should be done with a visa. In fact, in the original article that I've linked to, I've left it as a tip that these body's will help people get a visa once they've been approved for the job, I've talked about it as a process. Find a job, see what they offer, pick up the job and benefit from your visa work being done for you."}

I didn\u2019t do a crazy amount of hikes, so this way of travelling was good for me :) To answer your question, I bought them when I needed them. Decathlon in Europe did these 22 euro tents, not only did I use that tent for camping on my road trip through the Baltic\u2019s, I used it at a festival too. Especially in Europe, there\u2019s lots of options for buses, so carrying it was just an addition to my luggage for a very small period, and when I was done I gave it away. For hiking boots I bought cheaper ones before the hike from sports direct in Glasgow. I would tie them to the bag so they\u2019d dangle when I wasn\u2019t using them. Again, I donated them at the end of the last proper hike I did. Most things can be bought or borrowed for when you need them :) it was super easy. And as for that particular hike, it\u2019s so popular that each town over has a checkpoint, so after a day of hiking, we were lucky enough to have beds for the entire duration of that particular hike. Hope that sheds some light on how I went about it!"}

Almost anything your standard backpacker does can be done in trainers or lightweight hiking shoes (low rise). That's more of a preference thing than anything, but I've never used anything with ankle support -- I hate it. As for a tent, I love having my full camp setup with me. That's why I actually use a bigger bag despite having first traveled for a year with a smaller one. It's definitely not needed for your typical trip through Europe or Southeast, but as soon as you start throwing parts of Africa or hiking in South America in, I love having my own setup."}

Let's take Asia as an example. You can comfortably stay in amazing hostels that are very much above and beyond what you find in Europe, **in Bangkok it's $6 to $13 USD a night.** So your weekly expenses on accommodation clock in **about $70.** Food and entertainment is super cheap, and there's lots of attractions for either no entry or $1-2 entry. So for a week in Bangkok, you're spending anywhere from $200-$300. Obviously, different activities vary with how much they cost, if you try to get your Scuba Diving license, then that's going to be more expensive. But the gist is, you may think it's going to be way more expensive than it is. If you make sure you're going for cheaper flights, staying in accommodation that works for your budget. I'd say the best way to figure out what you personally are like on a trip like this, I'd make challenge to yourself, head off on a 2-3 week trip, and try to do it this way. See how much you spend!"}

Know what the cost of a flight is at specific times of the year. Everyone mostly knows that around USA Thanksgiving and nation wide Christmas flights are expensive, but aside from that, setup some custom Google Flights tracking for flight that look interesting 2-6 months in advance and see how much they change. A cheap flight and a cheap flight on that route are two different things. I have friends who routinely post about the *cheap* flights they have from the northeast of US (PHL / EWR) to Vegas or LAX and they are excited about paying $350. That's expensive! Know the cost of the flights... my go-to example is that flights out of EWR (one of the near airports for me) to Madrid and Barcelona non-stop are typically in the $350-400 region, so when they start showing up for $221, $249, $301, I know that it's a great deal. I only know this because I hunt for flights on a very regular basis. Bonus tip: Google Flights doesn't list all airlines, Southwest is never on their list - so if you live near one of the airports they serve, you'll have to manually check them or sign up for their email newsletters. Be aware of that, as local and regional airlines don't always show up and sometimes it's cheaper to book through them. Bonus tip 2: Stop paying for flights and get into a credit card with points that can be used for travel!"}

Flight attendants get a limited number of passes per year to give out amongst their list of flight guests, but they also have the crown jewel which is their companionship, meaning for free you can get on any flight anywhere anytime (only their airline) but you fly standby meaning a seat must be open for that flight, usually they are able to see the number of seats booked ahead of time and see what your chances of making the flight will be... I know people who sell the companionships (a few thousand dollars for unlimited flights for the year) I just happened to go to high school with someone who became one so I ended up on his list. That offers the ability to buy flights on credit basically for on demand flights... So either hang out at the airport and play by the law of averages (the more you talk to the more likely you find one person that gives you what you want) Convince a friend struggling with their path in life to become one. (Make sure they are single so you can get the companionship ;)) Or buy one a pass for the year of unlimited flights (internationally) I have access to some ppl selling those."}

Kayak is one of the only sites that has a decent flex-date option. It's not perfect but helps sometimes. Another option, if you don't mind the cheap seats, is going to all the discount airline websites (Spirit and Frontier in the US as example) and see their deals.

Honestly bro, DYOR! Exhaust your options- literally exhaust all the options to check prices at different vendors or even airlines. And unlike the popular opinion here by most about sticking with the airline and paying extra- I go along with 3rd party vendors because if you\u2019re like me and wanna pay the least amount of money for the flights- all you gotta do is do some research about the vendor and if they\u2019re not legit, trust me, you\u2019ll find it on google. Also- most people don\u2019t do this because it is out of our comfort zone- Just book flights from a major international airport to another international airport - even if you\u2019re going for a domestic flight- The logic behind that is- a major airport is pretty busy and has more flights so prone to have cheaper options. Also, if you\u2019re connecting a flight from a major to another, the fares will be cheaper. But as soon as you add your destination (assuming it isn\u2019t a metropolitan), the connecting flight will skyrocket your total travel fare unnecessarily. I\u2019d rather move out of the airport and find an intercity bus or carpool. Especially, for international flights, never book with your destination to be a domestic airport - price will be super high compared to the domestic airfares. And and and- When going through vendors like kayak and Expedia, there are many more, unheard names- go through them all- Not all vendors will have direct connections major airlines and some small vendor would have a good connection with a major airline and you\u2019ll see a price difference of $100-200 for the same flight easily. The whole reason behind so much work is- The time I spend making this extra money that I\u2019m trynna save is much more than the time I spend doing this to find a cheap flight, given the amount I save. Besides, it gives a sense of accomplishment everytime someone says I spent frigging $1500-2000 to reach here and I would spent like 700-800 hahahaha"}

Because if any problems happen in the way, you are screwed. For example, if your first flight is delayed and you miss your second flight or if your bags are not transferred to the second flight, airlines will not even talk to you. I bought through skyscanner (they redirected me to Flighthub website) once and when I got to the airport, they told me I have to clear security in London and re-check my bags (ended up paying again for checked bags in London) all in 75 minutes layover!! Skyscanner has fixed this since. Now they show a \"self-transfer\" note in there for flights like this, but a few years ago They did not have it. Now I NEVER BOOK THROUGH THIRD PARTY AGENCIES unless it is a direct flight and has a massive discount through the third party."}

Every Wednesday, it goes through the \\~150 most popular vacation destinations in the US, and checks round-trip prices for flights that leave on the upcoming Friday and return Sunday. It then checks the average hotel price at those destinations, and emails you the cheapest trips. Sorry, no international support yet, but if there's enough interest I definitely want to expand it! Let me know what you think, and if you have any suggestions :) ["}

If we can make this make financial sense and book at the weekly rate, we\u2019ll go ahead and book with you today. Let me know what you think.\u201c Hopefully this gives you some ideas on how you could maybe word your message. Best of luck!"}

Folks in other situations probably will be willing to negotiate when they are more desperate to fill their rooms, especially during slower seasons. So, it's true. A little secret from the trade: Here in the USA anyway, hosts generally form a lower opinion of potential guests requesting discounts, as we're not really a bargaining culture. As others have said, feel free to ask, but be careful to do so in a way that doesn't make the host feel his property is worth less than advertised... they can be kind of sensitive about it and may judge you harshly as a result.

It's better to have them working and paying taxes than on the public dole. In almost every developed country you'll need a work visa to work a regular paying job and those are typically only given to foreigners with special skills and education backgrounds. An employer typically has to sponsor you for a work visa and that often means that he has to prove that he can't find a national with your unique qualifications for the job. Naturally, governments tend to be less confrontational with powerful employers like banks and multinationals, in some cases granting them special work visas like the American H-1B. Trump, for instance, hired/hires a lot of H-1B workers for his hotels and vineyard, as if Americans don't know how to mop floors and pick grapes."}

What are you truly looking for? Are you looking for a legal route to permanently relocate to another country or just a temporary experience? Because most every response here, if they are actually proposing a strategy, is going to be a temporary solution or a path to skirt immigration laws for a bit while trying to earn money under the table. And that\u2019s ok if that\u2019s what you actually want to do. But if you\u2019re hoping to really relocate to another country, you\u2019re going to need to start researching paths to legal immigration that can lead to permanent residency. Ancestry. Look into gaining a visa via ancestry. I\u2019m not too familiar with this process, but generally speaking unless one of your parents or perhaps grandparents maintained their citizenship after coming to the US, this route probably won\u2019t work out. But it\u2019s worth researching. - Digital nomad visas. These went exactly common and it isn\u2019t as simple as having s remote job. They are typically designed for the self employed independent contractor or freelancer. Typical W-2 remote work jobs don\u2019t usually qualify here as you\u2019re an employee, and getting your employer to agree to allow you to work abroad comes with extra hassled for the employer. Realistically starting a career wheee you could work remotely while supporting yourself is a pie in the sky dream for many, and it\u2019s a pretty big step up from working as a server, but maybe it\u2019s something to work towards. But understand that the countries that do have this type of visa program do have their own sets or requirements that you would need to meet, one of which will be providing proof of means for financial solvency and self support. There are people who make it work, but it isn\u2019t an overnight process. - Skilled Migrant Visas. This is the most common route people use to move abroad. But it\u2019s a big, long term investment in your future. Hospitality work isn\u2019t in the list of fields most countries are hoping to attract immigrants for. There are often plenty of locals who can perform these jobs, and if not, usually the country will have some some sort of short stay temporary visa program to fill the gap. Getting the training/education and experience to convince a foreign employer to spend the time and money to sponsor a work visa for you as opposed to hiring locally won\u2019t be simple. And countries typically aren\u2019t opened ended about who would qualify as a \u201chighly skilled immigrant\u201d. Again, not an easy option, but most pathways to move abroad and permanently live abroad are not. Again there are ways to travel abroad and skirt the legalities, and these went the only legal paths you might be able to take (just a few common ones) but it really depends on whether you want something potentially permanent or temporary. Consider what you really want for your life and start your research from there, because whatever route you take, there are goi f to be sacrifices, trade offs, and difficulties, but I wish you the best of luck whatever route your take."}

Anticipating the downvotes already but here goes. From an old man, world traveler, and grandfather... Some 'unsolicited fatherly advice' (no, actually... It's solicited I guess). Think for a moment about this. You are asking a foreign country to invite you in, yet you bring zero skills other than speaking a language. Everywhere in the world but the US and maybe Europe, there is an overabundance of unskilled labor: I lived in India in 1986... Labor was so cheap, it was less expensive to pay local women from the village to break boulders down to gravel by hand than it was to buy a machine to do it. Fast forward twenty years to 2006? Same thing. And if you think the cruise ship industry abuses their laborers, try being a server in a restaurant in Tanzania. I mean, the highest paid people I interacted with there are the guys mopping piss off the floor in the bathroom, because every foreigner tips them USD $1 when they use the washroom (although that $1 is probably going to management, and the dude is getting a fraction of the money). When they can barely provide for their own citizens, why would a country welcome another unskilled mouth to feed? I'm not trying to be rude or to dash your dreams. Live abroad. Take risks. Heck, do it without even preparing yourself. But don't expect a welcome committee, and definitely don't expect it to be easy. Most countries tightly control immigration, using a points system based on skill set. You'd never qualify there unless you spend a little time preparing yourself. Life gives you what you earn - it's axiomatic. You could try this: Brigham Young University has created an online curriculum for students worldwide. It gives opportunities to earn certificates, an associates degree, and a bachelor degree. You could probably earn a cert in teaching English (that's one of their tracks) which would take maybe a year, would cost maybe $2500 total, and would bump you up several levels in terms of immigration status. pathway.org I'm a huge advocate for travel. Living abroad teaches like nothing else. So go do it, but either 1) expect it to be really, really difficult or 2) spend a little time preparing first. Beyond all else, I hope you have the experience of a lifetime, make incredible relationships, and learn to see through other cultural lenses. Go see the world OP!"}

But, my tolerance for risk is different than others, so if you're willing to risk it, then go ahead. That said, Argentina will grant citizenship after only 2 years of legal residency. The process is slow and annoying, but it's an option.

You can easily get a qualification within a few months and then get a job teaching there. It's a huge market and if you're American you will find work. Once you're there, you will easily be able to change to different language centres/academies/schools if you're unhappy with your first one. Overall the quality of life is pretty good in this field. Vietnam has a very low cost of living and foreign teachers are paid enough to live rather comfortably, and they often handle the visa situation for you. The qualify of life in Saigon and Hanoi for foreign teachers is very comfortable. You're not living like an absolute king but you can easily pay bills, eat out, have a social life, etc, and there are tons of other foreigners there so you won't be alone when starting out. The workload is very manageable, usually about 20-25 teaching hours per week and the rest of your time is yours to prep or whatever. When I did this I worked 4-5 days per week, usually was at work for 3-4 hours wed-fri, then 5-8 hours each on Saturday and Sunday. I lived very well on these hours. On base salary alone, I easily paid rent in a nice little apartment, could eat out frequently, went out for drinks with friends every week, and travelled around Vietnam during holidays/breaks, and still could save a few hundred per month. But I also picked up extras via private lessons for 3 hours over every week or two, which gave me an extra $400-$500 per month, enough to really pad my savings. Overall I usually saved about a thousand per month. And you can take on extra shifts and programs during summer school and get signing bonuses, usually an extra $1k-$3k. I lived this life before and it was great. If I didn't have the the opportunity to migrate to Australia via my partner, I'd still be living and teaching in Vietnam. It can be a great life. Edit: forgot to mention healthcare. Your private healthcare in Vietnam is affordable and basic treatment is good and accessible. Anything more complicated, many people make the cheap and easy flight to Bangkok, where they have healthcare options on par with so-called advanced western nations."}

Countries are, unfortunately, filled with people that have those skills. Why would they they go through all of that effort to get you a visa. I know that you want to leave, but the other half of the equation is that they want you. As much as I want to date a supermodel, that is only half of the decision process. If I were you I'd start by doing research into countries first, then look into what skills are in short demand in those countries (spoiler alert, it is not food service.) Additionally you may want to look at moving somewhere else in the US that might be more amenable to your situation. Obviously there are things happening nationally that are impossible to ignore, but there are states actively pushing the current agenda and states trying to fight it. When you consider the time and effort to go through a work visa process (6-12 months often) you may be better off focusing on your situation here."}

The same mindset applies here- **I don't care where I go, I just need to get out for a bit.** Wherever I wind up, I'll likely try and bounce around to neighboring countries if I can, but those airfares/train tickets are usually pretty cheap, it's the financial problem of getting somewhere from the US that bothers me. \\*Origin: SeaTac in Seattle (SEA) \\*Destination: Preferably Europe or Asia \\*Length- Preferably 14-21 days, wouldn't mind going for a month though \\*Expected budget- is a RT ticket out of the US for under $500 reasonable? \\*Luggage- 1 carry-on backpack, no checked &#x200B; The \\~5 week break between summer classes ending and fall classes beginning should give you some flexibility in choosing the exact departure and return dates.

Google flights shows that for 8/28/19 2 adults and 1 child can get a flight from MCI to DEN with a layover in SLC for $201 with Delta. SLC is actually closer to where we want to be, so I searched for just that flight alone and it's $595. why would it be cheaper for the 2 flights together than only the first one? Also, do you find it cheaper to do two one way flights than a round trip? My early research is showing that would be the case. We're wanting to go to yellowstone this time next year. We're in the middle of STL, MCI, and DSM. However MCI is giving the cheapest flights pretty consistently. Both DEN and SLC are good landing options. Do you have any advice for searching with such a wide range of options?"}

I will layout some tips I guess though that help me. 1. If you know nothing else. Know this. BOOK EARLY!!!. This is probably a simple fact that most people know but please don't wait for 2 weeks before to book flights. Prices tend only to go up. As the date nears, more people who are booking tickets tend to be business travelers and thus are not paying for the tickets themselves and thus airlines can charge a ton of money. 2. Be flexible. The summer tends to be expensive so travel on the off season. Friday nights are the most expensive, Tuesday and Thursdays tend to be the cheapest days of the week. 3. Know alternate airports. For SF, think OAK and SJC. For NYC, think SWF, EWR, JFK, LGA, ISP, HPN. For Miami, think FLL, MIA, PBI. Google what airports are close to your destination. 4. Know the \"Southwest Effect\". [ Southwest was the original low cost airline and thus the term stuck but this refers to any low cost airline airline that enters a route, and drops airfare for every airline. For example, Norwegian airlines has been drooping fares across the Atlantic for the past few years. Hawaii was also very cheap recently because of the Southwest effect. 5. Plan ahead If you want to get the best deal possible start getting a top 3 destinations in mind that you want to go to about \\~9-6 months ahead of time. Then figure out what would be a good air fare to the country. Then lurk on websites such as a [theflightdeal]( until a fare appears. What makes a good air fare? 6. As I have said. ITA, theflightdeal, Hopper, Momondo, Google Flights and Kayak, KIWI ( typically great for more IDK where to go moments) are great sites. 7. The following should be goals. ie they appear maybe once a month. * East Coast -> Europe: Cheapest Ever: \\~$160->$250 RT Realistic: Low 300s RT (Cheapest destinations right now in order from cheapest to more expensive: Dublin, Barcelona, Paris, London.) * West Coast -> Europe: Cheapest Ever: \\~$250 RT Realistic: Mid 300s RT * West Coast -> Asia: Cheapest Ever: \\~$High 300s, Realistic: Mid 400s RT * West Coast -> Asia: Cheapest Ever: \\~$ 400, Realistic: Mid 500s RT * Transcon: Cheapest Ever/realistic: low 200s RT. Vegas and Seattle tend to be 200 even sometimes from the east coast. * NE -> Florida: Cheapest ever: $60 RT: Realistic Mid 100s * Australia: \\~$800s?"}

Benefitting by skiplagging doesn\u2019t happen in the majority of cases. It\u2019s a travel hack, not the norm. Like in this case if the kid flew from Atlanta or Orlando to Charlotte, it would usually be cheaper than Gainesville to Charlotte. You generally see cheaper fares going from hub to hub, and it means pricing out the extra amounts getting to and from each hub. Adding a car rental, bus, or train to hubs is often cheaper than flying to them. If feel like the real issue is that our secondary options like car rentals and buses are getting increasingly bad. Many non-US countries have trains as great choices, but that\u2019s typically too expensive for the US to build out."}

Meanwhile, considering the way airlines oversell, they may well have already sold the 2nd leg of that trip twice. And even if they haven\u2019t, they\u2019re saving on weight by having that seat unfilled but already paid for. This is whiny nonsense from the airlines."}

Personally I don't see it like that, I see shoestring travel as something that enriches my experience whilst travelling. I've made a list of reasons why I think that and I'm interested in what the rest of this subreddit thinks. **1. You Gain A Stronger Insight Into Local Life** Naturally, as a shoestring traveller, you have to go where the locals go. That means eating at local spots, travelling on local buses etc. That means that we will get a greater understanding to what live is really like for residents of that city/ country. More so than someone eating in tourist focused restaurants or travelling by private transport anyway. **2. Better Food** Of course this one depends where in the world you are. But imo, in most places the best food is to be found where the locals are. They're the ones in the know anyway. Tacos in Mexico, thali in India and spicy soups in SEA for example. **3. It's More Adventurous** Surely this is one of the main reasons most of us travel, adventure. Being forced to travel on a shoestring budget puts us in certain situations, that more luxurious travellers wouldn't be in, which forces us to leave our comfort zone and embrace adventure. **4. You Can Travel For Longer** You can either spend $1000 in 2 weeks or 2 months, it's a no brainer! **5. It's Safer** Okay, maybe some of you will disagree with this one. However the way I see it, dodgy characters are more likely to target those clearly with a bit of money than some frugal traveller. Thieves targeting tourists go to where the money is, not the cheap places where we will be. **6. It's Better For The Environment** Travelling around extensively by plane is bad for the environment, duh. As shoestring travellers we use less planes and more buses and trains. We also use less private transport like taxis. **7. Your Money Goes Straight Into Locals Pocket** A lot of more luxurious hotels and restaurants are ran by expats and don't benefit the locals very much. When eating in a little eatery or staying in a small guesthouse we can be sure that our money is going straight into the locals pocket. **8. You Get To Share The Experience** Maybe this isn't true for everyone but travelling with another person is cheaper as it allows you to split costs. That means that finding someone else to travel with you is a great idea and travelling with someone else is great. You get to share everything you experience and you have someone to relive the experience with post trip. &#x200B; I'd be interested in seeing what you guys think about these reasons, which ones do you agree with, which do you disagree with?

So we figured he wasn\u2019t going to take on 6 of us. He gave us a great customized tour and showed us where the free beach we could walk to was. We went to Junkanoo beach the next day and had a great time. Chair rentals and umbrella rental cost us some money but the kids got free sodas (or maybe just refills were free) from the rental guy. Eventually people from the ship that had paid 75.00 each to go to Paradise island started showing up. The water was too rough at the other beach so they came to Junkanoo as it was more protected."}

It's Better For The Environment Travelling around extensively by plane is bad for the environment, duh. As shoestring travelers we use less planes and more buses and trains. We also use less private transport like taxis. It can be and should be. Unfortunately many travelers in Europe use cheap flights because going by train is expensive. Also, later in life a lot of shoestring travelers turn into regular travelers. So they rent vacation homes and drive around in a rental car to visit all the amazing destinations where no buses go. They eat at restaurants instead of buffets etc. At least that is what happened to us when we had more money for traveling. I read about some environmentalists that did a study. Going by bus to Spain, staying in a big hotel, sharing a pool with other people, going to the hotel club instead of driving somewhere, eating the food provided for the masses in a big room etc. is way better for the environment than a self planned holiday. It's sad but is true."}

We had a few trips to the grocery, gas, a few meals out... not as expensive as its made out to be if you know what you\u2019re looking for! Biggest secret for shoestring travel in Iceland... our first guesthouse kitchen was literally heaping with nearly full bags of dry goods, entire sticks of butter in the fridge, all kinds of things people had bought to make one meal and then left it all there because of their departing flights. It was absolutely unreal how much shit people bought and left. We raccoons sat pretty comfortable with our pilfered food items throughout the trip."}

I recommend that if you stay for around a month, get a bus pass. Busses are great, but super expensive if you buy individual tickets. The monthly card was around $100USD.

The difference now between traveling to Iceland rather than any other place is that its handling Covid like a boss. As of now, when entering Iceland everyone has the chance to either self-isolate for 2 weeks or have a swab sample taken from you to get tested for Covid-19 and it's for free. It will cost about 100 USD in the near future though. If it's negative you're free to whatever you want, if not then it's 2 weeks of isolation for you my friend.

Personally I'm hoping to see & hear more about using dogs who can sniff out Covid with a 92% accuracy. I read that one of the middle eastern airlines is using them."}

Feel free to add your own!", "content": "I have compiled a list of how to travel for cheap/free using tips I've picked up in my 8 years of travel and tips from fellow broke travelers. Please comment your own tips! Excuse my weak English. Most of these are for Europe travel but can apply to anywhere. 1. Travel to places when their currencies are down. For instance, the British Pound dropped by about 30% after Brexit was announced so the country was basically 30% off for foreigners. This means you get 30% more pounds when exchanging dollars to pounds while hotels, restaurants etc. have prices that remain constant. However, some businesses will raise their prices if massive inflation occurs. This is how I was able to stay in hostels for $3/night, hotels for $10/night and eat full meals for $1 in Ukraine in 2014 (right after the revolution). Currently Argentina\u2019s economy is down - you could get 9 Argentinian pesos per dollar exchanged in 2017 and 60 today. 2. Once you make friends in a hostel, you can all get a AirBNB together which I find is often cheaper than a hostel. Keep in mind there are cleaning fees that will add on to your total price. 3. Couchsurfing. Make sure you read their reviews before staying with someone. I\u2019ve had mostly good experiences but a few sketchy ones. As a rule of thumb, if someone exclusively has reviews from only one gender, there\u2019s a fair chance they\u2019re going to hit on you which can get sticky since you\u2019re alone in their house. I put that I am engaged (which is true) in my profile so people don\u2019t get pissy if I turn down their advances. Remember to bring a small gift for the host! A nice bar of chocolate is always a good option, bonus points if it\u2019s a gift from a country you just came from. 4. Take advantage of public parks. In my younger years I used to stay up all night in bars and sleep either on a hammock or scarf/towel in a park. I\u2019ve never felt unsafe or been hassled for loitering especially in huge parks like Vondelpark in Amsterdam or Englischer Gardens in Munich. Use a travel cube as a pillow and scarf/towel to lay on if you don\u2019t have room for a hammock. Put shades and earphones in and people are less likely to bother you. 5. Trains - A lot of countries have cheap night trains. Depending on how much you want to spend, you can get a bed on a train for way less than a hostel/hotel. I remember getting a bed on a 10 hour train ride from Odessa to Lviv, I think it cost $9. 6. Eurail - Best deal ever. You can have unlimited travel 10 out of 30 days for about 200 Euros. This includes night trains so you can save on hotels. I used to take a train in the morning to one town, spend the day sightseeing, and hop on a night train to another country right before midnight and it all counted as one day of travel. Fellow travelers reported using pencils and erasable pens on their tickets to travel every day, but this is against the rules so I can\u2019t recommend. I did the math and the trains I was taking would have cost me over $100/day while the pass was $25/day at the time. Chose 2nd class and under 27 years old for 25% off, it looks like the current price is $284 [ 7. Avoid vendors that do not have prices listed, otherwise the seller will try to overcharge you if you look like a foreigner. 8. Eastern Europe - Generally, the further East you go the more affordable everything is. Places like Belarus, Ukraine, Moldova, and Transnistria, are off the beaten path so they aren\u2019t too touristy. As I mentioned previously, I got hostels for $3/night, hotels for $10/night and eat full meals for $1 in Ukraine in 2014. My friends were buying packs of smokes for 50 cents. Museums were like a dollar and the famous opera in Kyiv was $4. If you\u2019re in Kyiv, make a trip to Chernobyl. My tour was $90 with student discount but lasted all day plus meals and only 6 others on my trip so well worth it. 9. Handwash your underoos in a sink with travel soap (concentrated soap tablets or strips). Handsoap is also fine. 10. Bring a small padlock and travel towel to avoid paying to rent one at a hostel. A lightweight scarf can work as a towel as well as many other things like a blanket, shawl, etc. 11. Travel sized dry shampoo works wonders on days when you don\u2019t have an opportunity to shower, like when you\u2019re sleeping on trains or parks. Bring a travel washcloths so you can take a hobo \u201cshower\u201d in bathrooms - scrub your pits and bits and put on deodorant and you will smell fine! Solid shampoo and conditioner in an Altoids tin take up way less space than liquid, Lush makes some good ones. 12. Free things to do - Always google free things in whatever city you\u2019re in. My travel companions and I loved to go exploring abandoned places like an old Soviet mental hospital in the hills above Zagreb, Croatia. PS if you go to Zagreb stay in this hostel at the train station that is an old train! It was $10/night in 2017 and the owner is the sweetest old man. Most cities have free walking tours but you should tip a few Euros. Most museums in Great Britain are free. 13. Be savvy about scams. A local in a bar in Prague told us all his friends died in the Chech revolution, so we bought him beers. The next day our tour guide told us it was called the Velvet Revolution because no one died! Beers were only 25 cents in Prague so it was more funny than anything. Most beggars in Europe are actually not homeless, they just make more money begging than an actual job, don\u2019t waste your money. If you want to donate, give them food, fake beggars will refuse the food and ask for money since they aren\u2019t really in need. There\u2019s a documentary on Youtube where a reporter follows some \u201cbeggars\u201d back to their huge house, don\u2019t get scammed. 14. The cheapest way to eat is to buy some bread, meat, and cheese from a grocery store and make your own sandwich. 15. Carpooling- In Europe there is a website called BlaBlaCar where you pay very little ride in someone's car from city to city. This is a good option if you aren't down with hitchhiking. 16. Foreign SIM cards - Monthly phone plans in Europe are super cheap. I got unlimited calls, text and 5 GBs of data in Scotland for $10/month and the plans work in the entirety of Europe (the same plan cost me $50 in USA). I find I need a wireless data plan to navigate cities, but there is an alternate way to navigate without cellular data plan or where you don't have cell service. Download this app called HereWeGo and download whatever countries you need and it works just like Google Maps but offline! 17. A good backpack makes a world of difference. If your back is killing you, you won't feel like doing anything fun. This is one item you should not cheap out on, but there are tricks to getting a nice, supportive backpack for cheap. Check your local craigslist for backpacks - I was able to get a new 40L Osprey Fairview (the woman's versions of of the Farpoint) for $45! Keep it under 40L so you it will fit under your plane seat and you can avoid baggage fees. A good rule of thumb is to keep your pack weight under 20% of your weight, so I try to keep it under 20 pounds for me. If you are a woman or have a small frame, consider getting a woman's backpack - the straps are situated closer to the middle of your chest and they won't pull back on your shoulder bones. 18. Other posters have commented about planes for traveling between European cities - I've seen budget flights like Ryanair have deals from $15 including fees! This can be cheaper than train travel as long as your backpack is small enough to avoid baggage fees."}

No need to pay full price for a checked in bag for flights and it's so much easier to keep an eye on your stuff and not hating yourself for having such a heavy pack. - Since Europe has free roaming since a few years back. Just get a data sim for like 10 Euro a month and register it online and just top up as you need to go. Makes life so much easier! - Stepping up your cooking game will save you a tonne of money. Learning to cook with just a handful of cheap ingredients from a local farmers market is a smart move. - Bus is a great way to get some distance for not a lot of money.

The 2nd \u201cfamily / group\u201dconsists of 2 adults + 2 children (ages 17 yrs. & 13 yrs.). A 3rd \u201cfamily / group\u201d consists of 2 adults + 2 children (ages 8 yrs. & 9 yrs. The 2nd and 3rd families will each travel with their own family, but it\u2019s not necessary for both families to be on the same flight. Also, the 2nd and 3rd families may be open to leaving from BUF (rather than ROC), enroute to SEA, if that would mean a significant price reduction. Another twist... a 4th family / group has already booked their flights (redeemed miles for award travel), and will travel out of BUF (Buffalo, NY) on Delta, via 2, 1-way tickets. They leave from BUF on Wednesday \\~ 5:50 p.m., 7/15/20, and arrive at SEA on Thursday \\~ 12:09 a.m. It would be wonderful if we could meet up with them when we, (at least my 1st group of 4), arrive at SEA airport! So, I\u2019m keeping my fingers crossed that you will be able to \u201cwork your magic\u201d, and find the cheapest flights possible to get us to our Seattle destination, and back home again, on the most convenient itinerary as I've requested. Thank you, in advance, for your dedication to this worthy cause, and any assistance you can offer. I realize my request is a lot to ask of you, but know that your help is appreciated more than you can imagine!"}

Someone told me AA is lowest amount in miles to Europe roundtrip but that none of my credit cards transfer to American Airlines. That same person said go with Aeroplan But it\u2019s so confusing. Can you please help me My family would be so appreciative And I would gladly pay you a fee ( couple $100 dollars?!?!)"}

I don't have one tool I use in particular. I will layout some tips I guess though that help me. 1. If you know nothing else. Know this. BOOK EARLY!!!. This is probably a simple fact that most people know but please don't wait for 2 weeks before to book flights. Prices tend only to go up. As the date nears, more people who are booking tickets tend to be business travelers and thus are not paying for the tickets themselves and thus airlines can charge a ton of money. 2. Be flexible. The summer tends to be expensive so travel on the off season. Friday nights are the most expensive, Tuesday and Thursdays tend to be the cheapest days of the week. 3. Know alternate airports. For SF, think OAK and SJC. For NYC, think SWF, EWR, JFK, LGA, ISP, HPN. For Miami, think FLL, MIA, PBI. Google what airports are close to your destination. 4. Know the \"Southwest Effect\". [ Southwest was the original low cost airline and thus the term stuck but this refers to any low cost airline airline that enters a route, and drops airfare for every airline. For example, Norwegian airlines has been drooping fares across the Atlantic for the past few years. Hawaii was also very cheap recently because of the Southwest effect. 5. Plan ahead If you want to get the best deal possible start getting a top 3 destinations in mind that you want to go to about \\~9-6 months ahead of time. Then figure out what would be a good air fare to the country. Then lurk on websites such as a [theflightdeal]( until a fare appears. What makes a good air fare? 6. As I have said. ITA, theflightdeal, Hopper, Momondo, Google Flights and Kayak, KIWI ( typically great for more IDK where to go moments) are great sites. 7. The following should be goals. ie they appear maybe once a month. How I usually book travel with friends is that we decide on a few possible destinations and we wait. We then pounce if we ever see one fo the destinations enter the cheapest ever region. I have gotten JFK->Tokyo for 400 RT and NYC->Dublin for 230 RT :) * East Coast -> Europe: Cheapest Ever: \\~$160->$250 RT Realistic: Low 300s RT (Cheapest destinations right now in order from cheapest to more expensive: Dublin, Barcelona, Paris, London.) * West Coast -> Europe: Cheapest Ever: \\~$250 RT Realistic: Mid 300s RT * West Coast -> Asia: Cheapest Ever: \\~$High 300s, Realistic: Mid 400s RT * West Coast -> Asia: Cheapest Ever: \\~$ 300, Realistic: Mid 500s RT * Transcon: Cheapest Ever/realistic: low 200s RT. Vegas and Seattle tend to be 200 even sometimes from the east coast. * NE -> Florida: Cheapest ever: $60 RT: Realistic Mid 100s * Australia: \\~$800s?"}

Given it's Thanksgiving travel returning Saturday to Monday are going to make the prices much more expensive.

This is a basic economy restricted ticket mainly meaning no advance seat selection. It also has a 1:02 layover in Chicago ORD. [Details]( Cheaper returning Dec 3. For the same timing of the return flight on American from DAY (05:45-08:42) it is $90 cheaper ($107).

From \"Why would I want to go to Mexico City? To .. Mexico City is my favorite city in the entire world\" = Since most of the users here are probably from the USA I want to give a suggestion that few Americans seem to know about or consider.. I know I didn\u2019t.. Mexico City (CDMX) I first kept hearing about it here on Reddit and shrugged it off as \u201cIt\u2019s Mexico\u201d.. but it kept popping up in all different subs on how much people loved it.. So I went down the rabbit hole of research on here as well as a lot of Googling: Top 10 Mexico City/CDMX as well as YouTube.. It looked amazing, was incredibly cheap.. so decided to go. My first trip was about two weeks and it was amazing, everything I thought it would be and more.. Usually a few days or so in a big city and you\u2019ve kind of seen everything and I start to get a little bored.. but there was a lot more to do here than most cities.. Then another part of the Shoestring part: About 6 months later I wanted to go somewhere for NYE.. I looked everywhere in the Caribbean and Central America and South America.. since it was the holidays, flights and accommodation were outrageous everywhere.. I spent around $600 from what I remember correctly for 2.5 weeks.. this was for everything: Flights, accommodation, transportation, food, entertainment etc. Just the flight alone to somewhere like Cancun, Jamaica or Puerto Vallarta was more than my entire trip. So we booked CDMX again.. this time it would be about a 2.5 week trip. Cheap flights from the USA - we flew from Texas at $210 round trip Amazing food: Super cheap amazing street food OR Very nice sit down meal and fine dining restaurants for $15+ Cheap accommodation - we did a private room in an AirBnB for $15 a night. 2021 EDIT/UPDATE I just booked a private room for $150 for the month. Private apartments start at around $250/300 if you look for a deal. Uber is like $2 for car pool for most of our rides. But, we basically walked or bicycled everywhere.. CDMX is one of the most bicycle friendly cities I\u2019ve been in.. lots of bike lanes and the traffic is very aware and courteous.. and they have hundreds of kiosks where you enter in your code and off you go.. and then drop it off at another kiosk.. Highly recommended and one the main highlights to me. I think there's around 500 of these bicycle kiosks with 10-20+ bikes in a very small area.. one on almost every block. Go to a kiosk, grab a bike and ride to wherever you wanna go... do whatever you wanna do, then grab a bike and go somewhere else, such a great fun way to explore the city. They also close down the main streets on Sunday mornings just for walkers and bicycle riders.. no cars allowed.. and thousands of people take to the streets.. such fun. I think it's $25 for the entire year / or I believe around $10 for a two weeks? ECOBICI is the name if you're interested in looking into it. WHAT TO DO: The city has everything. Now I haven\u2019t been there in over a year so I know I\u2019m forgetting some main things but here are most of my favorites: Historic cool old buildings and churches (has a European feel to the city) LA MERCED MARKET - It's the largest market in all of Latin America - (ONLY go during the morning/daytime) Tons of absolutely amazing parks - Chapultepec Park is the main one but there are dozens more. I think I read there's more green space/parks than anywhere else in all of The Americas but could be wrong. Great city walk in with some really cool neighborhoods - Centro Historico, La Condesa, Polanco (rich area). Great museums - don\u2019t miss seeing the Aztec Sun Stone (Aztek Calendar) - it\u2019s huge! (Museum of Anthropology) LUCHA LIBRE - Mexican wrestling - Arena Mexico - I\u2019ve always sat in the first or second row - they will literally fight in the stands right next to you - it\u2019s like WWE on steroids - buy your tickets during the day from the actual box office. FRIDA KHALO House - the neighborhood and local market is nice too Xhochimilco - boat rides through the rivers (Island of the Dolls is another option here) great for groups or a couple - some will have 20+ - it\u2019s quiet during the week or a big party place on the weekends.. music, food, entertainment as you\u2019re pushed along on a big bright colorful boat. Don\u2019t forget to check out the Axolotls as I think this is the last place in the world where they exist. Teotihuacan Pyramids - you can take the public bus from the north part of the city or hire a private car/bus. Can\u2019t miss. A FEW OTHER SMALLER MUST SEES: Sears Department Store coffee shop (tea and pastries as well) 8th floor - hidden gem - outdoor seating area with an amazing view of Palacio de Bellas Artes. El Morro - legendary local place - 3-4+ locations - hot chocolate and churros - often an hour wait just to get a table THE FOOD! Amazing food, amazing food, amazing food! This can\u2019t be said enough.. tacos tacos tacos If you like Mexican food - you won\u2019t want to leave. I\u2019m pretty well traveled at around 30+ countries; and Mexico City is my favorite city in the world. If you\u2019re looking for a place to go on more of a budget check it out, it may just work for you. Watch a few Top 10 videos on YouTube and get a feel for it. r/mexicocity is also a great sub for more info and itinerary suggestions I\u2019m just trying to spread the word to others here on Reddit as they did for me. If you\u2019ve been here please comment let us know about your thoughts, itinerary suggestions and experiences. And like I said I'm headed back there this weekend so if you have any suggestions that I missed or not the typical things to do, please let me know!? = Eating street food: Here's a tip for eating street food - you may be hungry think to just order a bunch of food (tacos or whatever) at one street food stall.. I recommend only ordering one thing, eating, then going to the next. Even if it's literally 2 feet away. I say this because there's so many types of street food, and each stall will have it's own twist and taste. I find it's a much more rewarding experience. = EDIT: Guess I've gotten 2 awards for this post today - thanks!"}

We had an awesome time in MCDX, another amazing experience I might add to your list for those travelling to Mexico City is going to see the Monarch Butterflies migration sanctuary, it\u2019s not a far drive outside the city. Certain times of year (we went in November) there are literally millions of butterflies everywhere. It was stunning. The higher you climbed up the mountain the more butterflies there were. One of the coolest things I\u2019ve witnessed in nature. All the monarchs in North America migrate to this one particular mountaintop. Pro tip: google maps will lead you the wrong way but if you flap your arms and say \u201cmariposa\u201d the locals in the village can point you in the direction of the sanctuary."}

Any of the markets great for street food, great fruit. Try some mamey sapote. I really loved the flea market at Jardin de Ignacio Chavez, on Saturdays only I believe Museo de Arte Moderno - not to be missed! Jard\u00edn Bot\u00e1nico del Bosque de Chapultepec...they revamped the gardens alloting sections to contempory landscape architects. Really great respite from the hustle of the city. Check out the amazing murals on the library at the UNAM Universidad Nacional Aut\u00f3noma de M\u00e9xico. Its a UNESCO world heritage site. The Botanical Gardens nice too....amazing collection of cacti. A good gallery on campus too. Diego Riveria murals at the Secretar\u00eda de Educaci\u00f3n P\u00fablica and the Palacio Nacional. Pasteleria Ideal Rep\u00fablica de Uruguay 74, Centro Hist\u00f3rico , make sure you go upstairs and see all the cakes! I dont really like mexican pastries, but just seeing the variety is incredible. Everyone should try the more unusual tacos. We had a cow eyeball taco and it was tasty. We also had amazing vegan tacos all over the city..mushroom, gusiado of various vegetables. We also tried grasshoppers, pulque, Cuitlacoche...corn fungus...a delicacy. I thought chiles en nougada (chilies in walnut sauce absolutely delicious). All the moles! The only disappointing food was the bread. I would save your calories for mexican food. We only used uber to get to and from the airport. Otherwise we walked or took the Metro everywhere. Honestly the traffic can be so bad, it is faster to use the subway over uber or taxi many times. Really inexpensive and we found it to be very easy to negotiate and felt safe (but never out late). We are experienced transit users and not fazed by much. Also, taco steps are a thing. we walked 20-25,000 steps a day and ate all the tacos and more, and did not gain weight. Another tip...if going to use metro, try to pick accomadations near different metro lines. From our airbnb in roma norte we could walk 3-4 blocks in three different directions to reach three different routes."}

But for Metrobus you need a card that you can buy right there for about $20 pesos - you can always ask someone to pay for it with the card and give them the cash (you will see some people doing this), Metrobus it's my fav option. Metro is always the fastest and cheapest option, if you are confident using it, it is always the best option.

Otherwise the camel tour guys waiting at the pyramids will offer you a great deal for a camel ride, but it typically does not include dismounting from the camel (and they\u2019re pretty tall animals) or a return trip back out of the desert. They charge extra for those. It\u2019s a well known and apparently accepted scam in a tourist trap. Doing it through a guide agency will cost you more upfront but save you money and stress in the long run and make the ride much more enjoyable for everyone including the camel jockey. Poverty is no joke and I have no ill will towards anyone trying to feed their families, but the guide agency will make sure the camel guys get paid a fair rate, and ensure you have a much more enjoyable ride.

I\u2019m excited for you because 10 years ago I was doing the same thing! Asia is the quintessential destination for shoestring travel and this time of year is probs the best time of year to head out there. If you do plan on Asia my unsolicited advice is as follows: This time of year is perfect as it\u2019s usually when all the backpackers are arriving. Stay in hostels, meet people and get chatting. You\u2019ll usually find people have similar plans to you or are doing things on the fly and want to join others. You can hear what they\u2019ve been up to or got planned and turn it into inspiration for your own plans. Don\u2019t disregard Laos and Cambodia. Laos is stunning, it\u2019s cheap (probably the cheapest in SE Asia) and the Lao people are friendly and hospitable and the country rich with culture and history. There\u2019s lots of history there that we know little of in western culture, for example: more bombs/munitions were dropped on Laos than Vietnam during the Vietnam war even though Laos were never formally involved with the conflict. Luang Prabang is a really cool place to visit with its French-influenced architecture and Monks conducting their Morning Alms (Sai Bat), one of the few places in the world to see this. Vientiane is the capital, again rich with history. Organised tours are great for Laos as you\u2019ll get a local speaking guide. You could cross into Cambodia from the Lao region of the Thousand Islands (Don Det) in the south. Cambodia is far more built for tourism than Laos which is why, in my opinion, Laos is sadly overlooked when it comes to the two countries. If you\u2019re heading out soon, you could reach Cambodia in time for the Water Festival - Bon Om Touk - (14-16th November) which is such a cool experience wether you\u2019re in Siam Reap or Phnom Penh. Then you\u2019ll have things like Angkor Wat, the Killing Fields etc to explore while there also. It\u2019s another country rich with culture and history which again in my opinion would be a shame to miss. There are organised hop on hop off tours that start in Thailand and finish in Vietnam but it\u2019s equally easy to do without an organised tour, comes down to personal preference. These give you a guide who speaks the local language, peace of mind when it comes to getting around and it\u2019s a great way to meet other people. That being said, it can just as easily be done without a hop on hop off bus. Their routes are good planning guides if you\u2019re going to self-manage your route and time. And my final piece of advice: If funds allow (it\u2019s still relatively cheap in comparison) check into a hotel for a few days every now and then. It\u2019s a nice cheap way to have a bit of privacy () and decompress from being on the go. It also allows you to enjoy some creature comforts, get some washing done and have some space to spread out. For example, I paid \u00a360 for 3 nights in a very nice 4* hotel with rooftop infinity pool in central Bangkok. After two months of hostels it was amazing. I managed to get so much sorted and properly relax after 2 months on the road. Hopefully that gives you a few things to consider and google/research further to give you a flavour of what\u2019s waiting for you out there. Have an amazing time and whatever you do, keep us posted!"}

If you can fix basic things on a home or landscape, those things are always needed anywhere you go as long as you can communicate enough in the language of the country you\u2019re in. Another is busking. Do you play an instrument or sing? You don\u2019t even have to be very good! Learn a song or two and be friendly and engaging. It\u2019ll earn you enough for a meal or train ticket. Another thing you could try is, I\u2019ve hired a person to softly play guitar at lots of low key events. It pays well and you don\u2019t have to be very good since it\u2019s just for ambience. You could advertise where you find yourself. Have fun! Sounds like the trip of a lifetime"}

We young people all over the world are facing a very uncertain future, with housing becoming unaffordable, and the threat of many jobs being taken by AI. I\u2019ve done the math, and I\u2019m not fairing any better: If I were to launch a professional career now (I\u2019m 26), I\u2019d have to keep grinding away for a Corporation with wages not high enough to cover the cost of rent in any desirable part of the US (Never mind buy a house), meaning I\u2019d have to keep living with my parents for who-knows-how-long. At this point, I\u2019m pretty fed up with it. At least with these backpacking jobs I see that provide an actual living wage, with some even having on-site accommodation, at least I can stand on my own two feet now. Young people are splurging their money on travel and other experiences, and I don\u2019t blame them one bit: We\u2019re trying to make the most of a bad situation. We want to LIVE, not just survive."}

Visa stuff means moving every 30 days to 3 months depending on where you are from and the local laws (we're American). That feature made it really cheap to get around when we weren't picky where or when we'd hop on to the next place. Getting to Asia from the UK there can sometimes be really surprisingly cheap flights from Greece or if you route through India on Indigogo (you would need a visa to transfer in India though if the flights are separate tickets). Like about $200 USD and a bit one way. Off season Europe can pretty affordable and southeast Asia isn't as cheap as we had thought it would be (we are a young family though, work online and want to be fairly comfortable. The cheapest options in SEA are a lot cheaper than we're doing like youth hostels, etc, but still.) Within Europe and within Asia we nearly always fly for under $50 a ticket (one way). No border has ever cared yet that we had a one way ticket. Three years and we've never been asked once other than at check in for one flight. My last piece of advice? Just do it. Book the ticket and come explore. Jump on in. The waters fine ."}

Dip a couple toes in it first. Take a week off, go cross a couple countries and return. See how that goes, how that feels and how doable or realistic is your idea. In any case, may fortune favor you friend, whatever you do."}

This is for a couple of reasons: 1) Travelling in Europe will be vastly more expensive than areas like Asia or Central/South America. Being a Brit you won\u2019t be able to work easily (thanks to Brexit) so generating income to fund your travels will be difficult if not impossible. 2) Remember that you can only spend 90 days in every 180 days within the Schengen Zone without a visa (again, thanks to Brexit) so you\u2019ll have to plan your time accordingly. Don\u2019t let the above piss on your chips, these are things to be mindful of, especially if you\u2019re broke and don\u2019t have much in terms of finances to fund 90 days in Europe.

Can't help with the job situation, I didn't work in S.E.Asia, even when I lived in Vietnam for a few months, but yeah I imagine once you get your foot in the door, it does help moving forward. Different jobs completely but in Australia our first job we had in hospitality then helped us continue with jobs through shared companies and managers etc, working in unique locations like on an island and in the outback. If you do end up in S.E.Asia, I'm sure you'll have an amazing time!"}

Yes, it\u2019ll be tough and it would be easier with a bigger budget, but I\u2019m not looking for a typical travel experience. This isn't about ticking off tourist spots or having everything figured out\u2014it's about immersing myself in different cultures and embracing whatever comes my way. I\u2019m fully aware that I might end up in a difficult situation, or even feel like I\u2019ve failed. But I won\u2019t know unless I try, right? I\u2019ve spent too much time overthinking and planning, and I\u2019m ready to just go for it. Maybe it won\u2019t be the life-altering experience I hope for, but it feels right to me right now.

I've been mostly checking 4/8 - 4/17. We are flying out of Boston. I've learned of airlines that offer free stopovers, often with modest freebies like city transportation cards. I've looked at TAP (Lisbon) and Iberia (Madrid) since April weather should be pleasant and we've never been to that part of Europe. With both, the stopovers shouldn't add to the price but I'm not seeing it and in fact when I play around with their online reservations, the cost of the \"free\" stopover flights has been substantially higher. For example, $950 round trip boston-~~lisbon~~-vienna (edit: my mistake, I meant with Iberia and thus Boston-Madrid-Vienna) and $1300 for the same with a \"free\" 3day stopover on the return. (Another edit: With TAP, I found Skyscanner TAP round trips Boston-Lisbon-Vienna for roughly $750-ish but on the TAP website with 3 day stopover, it was $950-ish. Any advice? Are the \"free\" stopovers a ripoff? Edit: thank you for offering your expertise in helping with flights. :-)"}

Things it does not do great (yet) 1. Does not display alternate airports well in friendly UI way. Especially origins. 2. Does not show Southwest flights as you say 3. Sometimes does not look for 2 OW flights vs. 1 RT flight. Kayak does this better. 4. Does not look for broken RTs. Think booking A -> B. and then B-> C Rt instead of A->C. (KIWI does this well) 5. Is not amazing at when people want to fly to a general area ex. Europe. Yes they have a explorer but I think it is just ok 6. Not amazing at hidden fees yet. (To their credit they are starting to show carry-on bag fees and airlines are intentionally try to hide them) 7. Going along with 1 and probably my biggest pain point with them is they do not do Catchment areas. ie you have to manually type in LA, Burbank, SNA, LGB, ONT or SFO, OAK, SJC. They do like all NYC airports but they should add more cities. 8. EDIT: Also their prices are not always accurate due to them cacheing the prices form previous searches but this is a developer decision they took that gives them faster search times. Probably a good tradeoff just something you have to be aware of. Darn NP hard problems To answer your question knowing the above and knowing cheaper alternate airports also KIWI + Kayak + Momondo + Google Flights gets me there."}

Here is the reality of PPP. To be completely forgiven 60% had to go to employees or something to do with employees, healthcare, employees deduction taxes, etc. 40% was for Morgage/rent or utilities. It was for 2 months the first round and 2 1/2 the second. If you didn\u2019t use it mostly for employees it became a low interest loan due completely 2 years after the businesses took it. Yes many businesses got part or all taken, but if you look at what I was originally commenting on those businesses took a lot more losses than 4 1/2 months during pandemic. My industry was shut down for 16 months with no mass gatherings. Hostels rely on dorm living, so they were restricted for just as long. I have talked to business owners from many countries who are in my industry and the all say the same thing, governments, with PPP and other programs covered 15-23% of pandemic loss the rest they offered in loans with along with ppp have come due between 22 and increasing in numbers in 2023. Remember small businesses actually in greater numbers than corporate ones but don\u2019t have the stock market route of banding their debt together and selling it as an investment like corporations can, they have to pass it on to get rid of it, if they don\u2019t it just like when people\u2019s credit cards are too high, you can\u2019t get anymore credit when you need it and the rates from the credit you have make it impossible for u to get out from under it without taking the other step of looking at an employee and firing them instead. The real reason for inflation now is all these businesses needing to reduce this debt raising prices and the next business doing the same causing this huge jump in pricing along with supply chain issues. Only one country in the world had a good and profitable result for their businesses from pandemic with 2.5 GDP growth, was China. Every other countries businesses in the industries described above where riddled with debt."}

FLIGHT: Southwest now flies to Hawaii from CA, which has caused a drop in price for others too. Not everyone lives in CA, but you might have a large US city near you, and round trip to LA or SF might be cheap from there, and then a cheap round trip to Hawaii. SLEEPING: I stayed here: With their instagram discount, I paid like $35 a night. There is another 1-2 hostels in the same area of Waikiki, all about a 2 minute walk from the beach. FUN: The hostel I stayed at does day trips that range $10-30 a person. However....you can rent a car on Turo for cheaper. I came prepared with a discount code, and got a seats 6, Ford Flex for $32. Add in gas, an uber to go get it, and then divide by 5 people total, we each paid $11 for a full days use of it. That's cheaper than the hostel's trips, and we stayed out longer. FOOD: Well my hostel had free breakfast. That's a start. Really though, I travel to eat local food. I don't really pay attention to prices on vacation. No I don't eat $50 steaks, but I will never ask myself, \"Oh, that dessert is $7, i don't know?\" if it looks good, it ends up in my belly. I had shave ice 8 times in 8 days, amongst other great food. TRANSPORTATION: The city bus is $2.75, exact change only, to get around. From the airport to the hostel? City bus! Want to go visit Pearl Harbor but not spend $25 on an Uber? City bus! EDIT: One last thing. Don't be foolish about this, but SouthWest does tend to offer 50K bonus points for signing up for their credit card if you spend like 2K in the first 4 months or something. I just checked for January, San Jose to Honolulu, and I'm seeing about 8-10K each way. So 50K could get a couple to Hawaii for free. EDIT 2: For more information as to my trip, I only went because I had a $500 voucher since SW bumped me from my last trip. My flight was thus free. The hostel I want to say $310ish for 9 nights. I did visit Kualoa Ranch where they filmed Jurassic Park and World, and that wasn't \"showstring\" as my ATV and Hollywood set tour combined with pickup and drop off was like $175. I ate like a fat kid, spend my days snorkeling, hiking, and swimming, and while I haven't done that math, I'm easily under $1,000 for 9 nights, 8 FULL days in paradise. I'm thinking more about $750-800 range."}

The flight was one-way from Barcelona to Toronto for August 2020. This flight was chosen mainly because it was a direct fight provided by Westjet (a company I trust). For months before the trip, I was only given a Westjet booking # and a Hopper #. During the Covid-19 months, lot of flights were cancelled and we were allowed to request a full refund in the form of a flight credit/voucher. I requested for that in the summer 2020 but didn't hear anything from Hopper for months and I emailed them again in November 2020 about the status. I didn't get any response. There is no phone number that I can contact them with. I decided to give Westjet a call to see if they can help. I found out that the ticket numbers did not belong to Westjet (as theirs begin with 838); instead they belong to a company called Hahn Air (theirs begin with 169). I started doing some research on Hopper and I found out it is very common for Hopper to issue tickets for itineraries that cannot be ticketed on airline stock. I contacted IATA to complain about Hopper and they refused to provide me with any information or help. I went onto the Hahn Air website and tried to request a refund through their online form, but I didn't have Hopper's IATA code and they didn't recognize the ticket numbers, so that was useless. It was definitely a fraudulent misuse of the E-ticket system and the responsibility is known and shared by both Hopper and Hahn. I started a complaint file with Better Business Bureau and Hopper just simply refused to respond and the file was closed after several months. In the end, I never got my money back."}

I know my situation may not reflect that of everyone, but I want to show that it is possible to travel long term with relatively little money. I try to go into as much detail as I can, so pardon the length. For the last 6 months I've been solo traveling around South East Asia, so far spending time in Thailand (1 month), Laos (1 month), Vietnam (3 months), and Cambodia (1 month). Its been an amazing trip and even though I haven't spent much money, I haven't once had to say \"no\" to an activity that I wanted to do. I've been a part of a Thai meditation retreat, went tubing in Vang Vieng, taken a cruise in Ha Long Bay, and explored Angkor Wat to name just a few of the many cool experiences I've had. Just because you're on a shoestring budget, does NOT mean that you can't have tons of fun along the way. So how much does it *really* cost to travel? All things considered (without my initial flight to Asia), it costs me just under $15 a day, but the number can easily be a bit lower or higher depending on the country. If you\u2019re wondering, Vietnam was the cheapest as I spent less than $1000 in 3 months and the others cost me between $450-600 a month. I like to split my travel budget into the daily essentials (food, water, shelter), the semi-essentials (long distance travel, local transportation, mobile phone, etc.), and the non-essentials (activities, alcohol, taxis, etc.). I'll break down how much things really cost and how to keep expenses down in more detail below. Essentials: * Food: This is my biggest expense. Depends on the country, but expect $1-3 a meal for local food where local people eat.\"Local food\" in tourist restaurants is often closer to $3-6 and Western food is $5-10+ and can mirror what you'd pay in the West. Don't be afraid of local food. If a bunch of locals are eating it, it probably won't make you sick, because as the late great Anthony Bourdain once said, \"its bad business to poison your neighbors.\" Food is the culture of SEA so experience it as much as you can. * Water: You can't drink the tap water, but bottled water is cheap. $0.20-0.60 for 1.5L bottle. * Accommodation: This depends on you. In 6 months I have never paid more than $6 for a dorm room and since figuring out the \"tricks\" I haven't paid more than $4. Almost all of them have been good and most have included a comfortable temperature at night, privacy sheets, and hot showers. The key to finding deals is to use Agoda or [Booking.com]( Limit your search to places reviewed 8.0 or higher and sort by lowest price. If there are tons offered, raise the review rating and go with the highest rated place that fits your budget. Regardless of the price, if the review is 9.0+ and has more than 30 reviews, its probably a good place to stay. Private rooms are usually much more expensive, but I\u2019ve only stayed in them a few times so I\u2019m not as familiar. $10-15 is what I paid in Cambodia and that seems average for the region but I\u2019m not entirely sure. Semi-Essentials: * Long-distance travel: This can cost a lot or a little depending on where you want to go and how you want to get there. In general, don't be afraid of night busses. Yes, there are accidents. Yes, people die. But tens of thousands of local people and tourists alike use them and almost all live through the (more or less pleasant) experience. In Vietnam, a night bus can take you 12 hours away for less than $13. You shouldn't spend more than $15 traveling city to city this way, and often it's under $10. Flights are also a viable option, as many are less than $50 and you gain time and comfort (but watch the high fees/taxes and luggage limits). Some destinations are more difficult to do on a budget than others though, as Laos to Vietnam has you choose an 18hr or so bus from hell or a $117 flight. I opted for the flight. * Local transport: Simply one of the easiest ways to waste money if you're not careful. Always check and see if public transport is available, especially in major cities like Bangkok or Saigon. Bus fares are usually only $0.10-$0.50 while taxis are usually $2+. $2 may not sound like much, but there and back is the same as a dorm room. These costs really add up. The best option is to plan ahead and stay near the main tourist sites, so you can just walk and spend nothing. * Mobile Phone: Get a SIM card. Besides the small fee for the physical sim (less than $5) my data in Vietnam was $0.40 per gb for a month. It's really that cheap. Non-Essentials: * Activities: This is why we travel. If you're not going to experience the places you travel to, why go there? It doesn't mean that you have to spend too much to get a lot out of it. Prices vary considerably, but generally speaking temple entry is free to $3 (higher in Bangkok), historical sites are $1-5, and nature sites are free-$3. These are rough estimates, but I've rarely spent more than $5 in one place. Tours can range from the cheap, my Ha Long Bay tour was $15, to the very expensive, elephant tours are usually $75-150 (I decided against it). If you want cooking classes, its usually $15-30. If you want to save money, then never book someone to do something you can do yourself. If you don't have a choice (i.e. Ha Long Bay) then find a reputable cheap option. If you stay at quality cheap hostels, they can be of immense help with this. Don\u2019t forget that you can splurge on an activity or two that you really want to do, so still go to Angkor Wat even though it costs $62, SCUBA diving if that\u2019s a dream of yours, or another item on your bucket list. If won\u2019t kill your budget if you keep costs down in other areas. * Alcohol: Beer is king and usually pretty good. Prices range from $0.20-0.50 (Vietnam) to $0.80-$1 (Laos/Cambodia) to $1.20-$2 (Thailand) and higher in bars. It sounds cheap until you drink 6 of them and you realize you drank double what you paid for your dorm bed. If you're a heavy partier, you will have a very hard time staying under budget, especially if you drink liquor instead of beer. Doesn't mean that you can't drink and keep a moderate budget, even I can't resist a delicious BeerLao, but there's a reason alcohol and financial sense don't mix well. * Taxis: As mentioned above, avoid taxis. If you do need them, then download Grab. It's the \"uber\" of SEA and will keep you from getting ripped off. Keep in mind the ways the locals travel and do that. In Thailand, Tuk Tuks are almost always a rip-off (besides the \u201cred taxis\u201d) but in Cambodia they\u2019re the main taxi option while Vietnam relies on motorbike taxis. The locals almost always do the cheapest option, so follow their lead. * Souvenirs: If you find a meaningful souvenir, then don't feel bad getting it. Just make sure its ethical, meaning don't buy things made from the metal from bombs (encourages dangerous scavenging), animal parts (encourages poaching), looted historical artifacts (illegal and could get you in trouble for bringing out of the country), from children (encourages them to drop out of school and continues the poverty cycle), and other discouraged practices. To find the best deals, buy items from their source or in markets where you see local people actually buying things, not just tourists. Additional tips: * Never think of money in terms of your own currency/prices back home. A $10 cab ride may sound cheap if you're from New York, but if the local price is $2 you're grossly overpaying. This extends to everything from food to hostels. To find the local price, ask hostel staff or ask various sellers to see how much the going rate is. For consumer goods, see what the price is at national chains like 7-11 and go from there. * Mentally use a comparative pricing system. If your dorm costs $4 and that Starbucks costs $4 then is the drink worth losing another night of travel? At the same time, maybe a little piece of home is what you need to keep going when you feel homesick. Know the price you're willing to pay and prioritize what you're willing to spend it on. * Sometimes prices aren't scaled the same as back home, so be careful. For example, a juice can easily cost more than a full local meal in SEA. At the same time, drinks like beer may be only a couple cents more expensive than soft drinks at dinner. It may surprise you, so remember to keep prices relative to each other, not your expectations. * Don't get ripped off, but don't be a jerk either. Don't allow someone to overcharge you double or triple what the real cost is. At the same time, most people selling things on the street are extremely poor. Paying $0.20 more is not going to kill you, but it may mean making a sale that helps someone else get to eat that day. Find the price that you are willing to pay, and if you think its fair then don't push it unnecessarily low. * Keep track of all purchases. I use the Tripcoin app on iOS and I've found it works great for me, especially considering it's free. I'm sure there's other options out there as well. Believe me, money is much more real when you see how much you're actually spending and it allows you to budget accordingly. * Get an ATM fee free card before leaving and withdraw cash free from anywhere. Charles Schwab is a great option for Americans. * Always buy travel insurance. If anything goes wrong, it pays for itself. I use World Nomads and since they more than adequately serviced my claim I'll probably stick with them. If you plan on riding a motorbike (and even if you don't plan on it) get a license and an international drivers permit before leaving to stay covered in the case of an accident. * Consider teaching English online if you qualify and need some extra cash. One or two days working could likely fund an entire week of travel in many places. I apologize for how long this post is, but congrats if you made it to the end. My trip is over 6 months long (and still going) but almost everything I said still applies even if you aren't planning on being gone so long. I'll be happy to answer any additional questions people have in the comments. I still plan on going to southern Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, and Indonesia in the next 2 months, so if anyone has any advice on those destinations I'm all ears as well."}

For Thailand I met someone who showed me the closest shop so I went with that, Vietnam I did some research on Google to make sure I had full country service, and Cambodia someone leaving gave me her SIM for free. I used AIS in Thailand, Metphone in Cambodia, and Viettel in Vietnam and all were good. I\u2019m American so I get visa on arrival or visa free for all the countries. Vietnam is a little more complicated, and it\u2019s somewhat changing this summer, but not that hard to figure out with some research. With an e-visa you can get 1 month but with visa on arrival you can get 3 months if you get an approval letter ahead of time.

Again, PLEASE be as specific and as unambiguous as possible. ie 7/15->7/30 or +/- 1 day is better than \"Late July\" or \"flexible\".

Leave Tuesday, return Saturday, can get it down to $217 on United. &#x200B; Another tactic is decide on which end you are willing to accept a long bus or train trip.

You've pretty much got one option anywhere near your budget, but it violates your 2hr connection rule. This whole shebang is pricing at $212 through Kayak, though may be a little cheaper through each indiviudal carrier's site. Note a bag is going to run you roughly $30-35 each way. Frontier outbound, BNA-DEN-LAX, depart 505am arr. DEN 716am. Depart DEN 957am, arr. LAX 1132am. Spirit home LAX-LAS 405pm arr 516pm, dep LAS 1150pm, arr BNA 527am. That's a long connections, but maybe go win your airfare at the casino? &#x200B; Any real carriers with less awful connections start at $469 for basic economy (Delta, carryon allowed). Let me know what else I can do. &#x200B; If you have any credit card points, now might be the time to deploy. I can help with that."}

My answer would be just a version of my own interests. Since it\u2019s a raging pandemic, leaving during the post holiday wave seems about as bad a time as one could select. Knuckle down until you are vaccinated and restrictions begin to fall away. during that time read a lot lot lot of travel blogs. Cycle blogs, hiking blogs, distant travel writing... do your homework and at least get some goals. From there you will at least know something more that you want. Having a 3 or 6 month goal to work towards/ plan / save for will be exciting and motivating. Put your affairs in order so you don\u2019t have expenses or pressures to return. Learn a lot about being frugal if you want to stretch your funds. And consider jetting off to somewhere oft-travelled, cheap and exotic. South east Asia is often a good mix of those things... Good luck. You can learn a lot on the road but I suggest getting the above sorted first."}

Never do anything without very clear terms of what work will be done and the compensation that will be given. Anyone who is purposefully ambiguous is usually someone who is looking for a way to rip you off. The people who are fun to work with and want to offer a fair and good experience are extremely clear about what is expected and what is being offered. It might seem strict at first but please believe me that is a good sign and exactly how you want it. It can be crazy stressful but the rewards are great. Good luck!"}

There are lots of people who do it on a shoestring budget since you don't need a new bike or anything, it can be as cheap as you want all the way down to foraging/dumpster diving for food, up to staying in hotels along the way.

I posted this over a year ago but figured there has to be some of you that'll get some inspiration or value from it by reposting it. Hopefully it inspires someone.. I spent a total of $500 for 3 months going around Vietnam.. all by scooter/motorbike. I spent most nights camping in my tent: Beaches with water buffalo sticking their head in my tent. On top of mountains above the clouds with wolves howling all around me. Abandoned buildings. Stealth camping in public parks. Next to graveyards. Asking locals to camp in their yards. On city streets. Behind constructions sites Truck stops. Bus stations. Parking lots. Beaches, beaches and more beaches.. pretty much all the beaches are completely empty.. nobody seems to care to even build on most of them it seems.. Also did some Couchsurfing.. and stayed in a few hostels ($1-3 per night - hostels are very clean in VN). Highlights: The famous Ha Giang Loop - I guess this is considered some of the best riding in the world? Going through all the small towns where they see very few foreigners.. I went a few weeks straight where every single day I was offered free water, snacks, freebies of whatever food snack stall I was at, at the time, invited for lunch and dinner a dozen times, lots and lots of alcohol (I don't drink).. tobacco bongs they smoke up in the North (Not my thing either). I've been to quite a few countries and I'd say the VN people are the friendliest I've ever encountered.. right up their with Turkish and The Philippines. For those wondering.. bought the bike off of FaceBook.. There's a bunch of FaceBook Groups where travelers buy and sell to each other.. as many people ride between North and South - Hanoi and Saigon(Ho Chi Minh City). You can also rent a scooter in one of those two cities and drop it off in the other if you don't want to deal with buying and selling etc. Most bikes cost $100-500... and generally are sold for about the same when you're done with your trip. I paid $300 for mine.. and sold for $400 at the end. 110cc - Honda Wave - this is probably the number one used scooter in all of SE Asia.. it's the \"common mans\" car/suv/grocery getter/wife and 3 kids hanging off - go up and down the mountain getter. I had two flats/tire punctures: I got them repaired at scooter/tire shops One cost me $.40 cents and the other one $.80 cents I believe lol. I changed the oil once - yeah.. I always neglect maintenance.. I think it was around $5-8? Basic expenses: Fuel is cheap, I think I was spending like $2-3 most days. Camping is free.. locals don't really understand what you're doing.. no biggie.. Hostels are $1-3 in the entire country and very, very, very clean. The cheapest I paid was $.87 cents a night and had access to 3 pools! This is not normal, so don't expect this, but can't beat that!? Use Agoda.com and Booking.com. Hostelworld.com is by far way worse in SE Asia. Usually 1.5-2x more money and half the listings. Nobody really uses it once they know better. Hotels/guesthouses are $4-5 in the entire country if you look around for a deal or just walk in and offer them 100k ($4) from what I heard they'll generally always take the money if you flash it in front of them. (I didn't stay in any, but many people I met have) 5/6L of water is $1 (I'd buy one just about every day) Average local street food meal is $1 - $1.50 - in every town, in every city, just like the other nearby countries, Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, Malaysia etc. I will say finding camp spots is almost impossible in this country.. either dense forests you can't even get into.. water filled rice paddy fields.. fenced in properties.. cities etc.. but I did camp in some amazing and memorable spots so it was worth the effort. I only did the camping to get some experience as I have a big trip planned in the future.. but I don't really recommend it is it's just way way way too hard to find hidden spots unless it's along the coast... camping on the beach was incredibly easy as it seems nobody lives or they don't build on the beaches.. but anywhere inland was tough. It would sometimes take me 3-4 hours to find a spot, and even then it wasn't always a good spot. I ended up pitching my tent on a sidewalk in the middle of a medium sized city, felt a little weird about it, but it was a great memory and I have a cool pic to remember it. I bought the camping gear in Hanoi and sold in Saigon when I was done on the scooter/motorbike sales FaceBook group to another rider. Cheap tent, sleeping bag, sleeping mat. I think I paid $75-80 total and sold them for $40 after the trip. 21L backpack (my normal backpacking setup) with all my clothes etc etc .. strapped with bungees. I always carried one or two 2L soda bottles with extra fuel - in the picture strapped to the back.. it was nice as I could just refuel at the campsite in the evening/morning.. and refill with gas at the station easily right into the bottles. $1 poncho for rain I see a lot of short way more expensive trips posted on here.. just wanted to give a super low budget option.. you just need the time to do it.. I've ridden all over SE Asia and Vietnam is the best I've seen.. second favorite route is in Laos.. The Pakse Loop .. tons of amazing waterfalls. .. if there's enough interest I can post about that too. I'm currently planning my next trip. \u200b\u200bI want to ride the lower 48 states, across Canada, up to Alaska and down through all the countries in Central and South America and end in Argentina..\u200b\u200b And if I like that ride.. maybe ship it to Africa and go on from there..\u200b I'm thinking Honda Ruckus 49cc .. basically look at it as a bicycle tour like many thousands of people do.. just on a scooter. Here's a few links I found with more pics from other threads from another sub I've posted in if interested: reddit.com/r/scooters/comments/dqvsyj/going_through_my_old_pics_ha_giang_loop_in_vietnam/ reddit.com/r/scooters/comments/au91vm/sneaking_into_an_abandoned_water_park_in_vietnam/ reddit.com/r/scooters/comments/aq38y0/scooter_camping_in_vietnam_more_memorable/ reddit.com/r/scooters/comments/aquppx/twisties_ha_giang_loop_northern_vietnam/ Anyone else rode in Vietnam; or somewhere else; or done something similar? Any questions, just ask."}

It is very hard and quite frankly rude to deny a gift from someone who is excited to see you, wants to lend a hand or happy to meet someone new just because you think you have more money then them. By no means am I saying to beg your way through a country (that grinds my gears when people do that), but being friendly and not pittying a person without knowing them personally, is the way to go. I have found the same thing very difficult with my time in historically poorer places like Vietnam or even refugee camps in Greece. At the camps, families would try to thank us by giving us bags filled with part of their rations, home cooked meals and anything they managed to salvage from their home. They wanted to thank us the only way they knew how and wanted to be treated as equals. It was a horrible offence to deny such gifts. Obviously, we did not consume these gifts ourselves and would get creative to give them back to the community, like parties for the children, gift baskets left outside of tents, prizes for games, but the last thing we wanted to do was make them feel inadequate with, \"Oh no, I can't accept this, you need this more than me.\" Same applies traveling in poorer countries. If the friendless is off the charts, feel free to accept the help/gift and give back in other ways like stopping by the next day with a gift, sending a postcard and picture at your next stop, donating to a org in that village (schools love getting any type of supplies or donations), bring small gifts from your home to \"exchange\" with the locals, buy a few more rounds of drinks than necessary, etc."}

Have you ever done a deep read through this sub and similar resources to travel as cheaply as possible? The first 3 months in Vietnam I averaged around $80-100 a month including the visa by doing a help exchange for free housing and food. Travel doesn't have to be expensive if you relinquish luxury, live like locals, and exchange value. ----------- Some specific points: * I doubt he found many $1 hotel rooms, but he mentioned paying 100k ($4.30) which could be possible if he showed up at night looking to crash for a few hours. Alternatively, insane hotel booking discounts do exist. I wouldn't expect it to be a regular thing, but it's possible. * That said, the cheapest housing costs less than 2m ($86) a month here. [Here's a listing]( for an empty room, all you need is a floor mat or sleeping bag. That's 1m a month ($43). There are tons of listings like this. Like I said, it's not luxurious, but it's cheap as hell. If you only rent from English-speaking Facebook groups, you're probably getting the foreigner prices. * I hand wash my laundry while traveling. All you need is a bathroom. * A 6L bottle costs 23k ($1) at every convenience store. Maybe you never saw this size bottle? My 18L bottles cost me 30k ($1.31). * It's not a cost to use what you bring from home, like toothpaste. Otherwise you'd factor the cost of the backpack, too? 3 months is fine for one tube. * I read your other comments now and you must be a big guy to need to eat so much. Plenty of locals only eat exactly what you're describing per day, especially university students. * That said, there's a lot more food than ph\u1edf and b\u00e1nh m\u00ec. Vegetarian meals for example can cost 8k-25k ($0.35-$1.09) for a good sized portion. Produce from local markets is very cheap, 6k ($0.26) for a kg (2.2lbs) of bananas for example. You could easily eat fresh fruits and veggies plus a local rice or noodle dish for less than 40k ($1.75) a day. I'm guessing you didn't make many local friends to show you the discounts and cheap ways to eat and live? It's hard to find cheap places without help. ------------ As a closing remark, no, I don't recommend begpacking. Is this cheapness possible? Yes, I think so. It won't be very comfortable, but it's possible. It's an interesting case study and very fitting for this sub. Imo op was a little oblivious about social norms and maybe missed a lot of subtext. That said, I've only learned a lot about this by living here - I've never travelled in Vietnam. *Should* you travel this cheaply in a country like Vietnam as a westerner? No, I think it perpetuates poor stereotypes of westerners. Random camping here is also really unrecommended as you need to register your temporary residence with the local police. Just get a monthly rate for a hostel, they register you. Where's the line between shoestring and begpacking? I'd say in your value proposition: are you providing positive value to locals moreso than taking it? This value absolutely should include money like paying for shared meals, buying coffee, tipping drivers, etc. But it should also include time, like helping practice English, doing the dishes, and facilitating understanding between different cultures."}

SAT isn\u2019t a great airport to be flying out of as it\u2019s smaller with less service and as such more expensive. Best I could find was flying from Austin, booking Alaska Airlines basic economy to Seattle, then separately booking a ticket from Seattle to Hanoi. On the way back, do the reverse, booking a separate ticket on Alaska for after you reach Seattle. Total came out to just under $1000. The biggest problem is that you\u2019re not necessarily too far out for booking the long-haul flights. But sales for short-haul domestic flights haven\u2019t really started yet. Hell, Southwest doesn\u2019t even have flights for April on sale yet. Keep tracking and maybe you\u2019ll find a good deal. Remember the major airports with Asia service are LAX, SFO, and SEA. Since you only will have a carry-on and personal item, don\u2019t be afraid to book your long haul flight separate from your domestic connecting flight if it\u2019ll save you money, just be sure to leave plenty of time in between (at least 3 or 4 hours) to account for any delays."}

If you do intend to fly back to KUL at some point, your better off buying a round trip, even if you don't know the dates. For $1100 you can get a round trip for say 10 days, and if you need to stay longer, call the airline and change the return date.

Deals are done with card companies too. Scott's does not use affiliate links but it is still not cheaper than i expect them to be. Secretflying uses affiliate code from skyscanner but it is free to use. Both services can handle such a small user base as tickets are limited, so prices go up as you check them. Deals are for specific dates, destinations etc. Affiliate is widely used by all services other than scott's which has a fee, and they dont share the cheapest ones if they don't get affiliated. Searching whatever search engine you know will mostly bring cheaper prices if you just dont believe them. They make you think it is cheap they are not cheap enough. I think like that because previously I let people buy 1$ tickets internationally using just simple searches for them, so anything is possible until everybody discovers it."}

Being broke is bad. You can get what you want responsibly with some patience and planning. Totally understand! I took a year off work and I'm traveling the world, among other things. (Look up Mythical Year Off on YouTube.) I estimate the year will cost 10-12K, including plane tickets. First, wiping out your savings for anything other than an emergency or solid investment is *never* responsible, period. But you should definitely travel while you're young! The compromise: Why not take 3k out of savings to go somewhere like Peru for a couple months this summer? It would be a cheaper, shorter trial period that would responsibly meet your desire, plus provide valuable experience for when you do take the bigger journey. I'm 28, and worked for five years after graduating before pulling the trigger. I'm very glad I did. If I exceed my budget I won't be sunk, and transitioning back into a normal life will be much easier with that extra padding. Professionally, I have a guaranteed job upon return because of my experience level and connections made along the way. Also, if you continue to teach, there's little reason you can't take a solid trip each summer."}

SE Asia is dirt cheap, Japan, not so much. Eastern Europe, super affordable, Switzerland, not so much. Personally, if your life savings is $10k I'd strongly suggest against a year of travel, but that's me (at 40). If you have zero Roth IRA, 401k, oh-shit-fund and don't have 3-6 months worth of all your monthly bills (where you currently live) stashed away, you're going to come home and essentially be broke and poor. The other side of the coin, you can likely do some sort of work while you travel to help offset the cost a bit. Last thing to think about - from someone who has done a fair amount of solo traveling, Being alone in a foreign country is empowering, fun and energetic, it can also be extremely lonely, tiring and boring. Can you deal with that much isolation? Would you build in enough time and money to fly home to visit friends or have friends commit to flying out to meet you for a week here and there?"}

I am also 24. I've managed to save about $6k. I'm planning on traveling to 3 or 4 different countries in a 2-month stretch. Now's the time to go. If not now, when? My advice is to tally up your reoccurring bills that are necessary e.g.; debt paid monthly, health insurance, car payment, rent payment (unlikely if you're traveling for a year) and other such necessary expenses that will haunt you if you default (don't pay) them. There's a few things to think about destination wise. Which countries will allow you to metaphorically \"Stretch\" your dollars. If you visit expensive countries and end up not having a place to stay that will hit you with a huge expense. Everything costs money and other posters are 100% correct when they say \"look for work along the way\". Even if it's not glamorous. It will give you the ability to stay somewhere for free and potentially take a part time position that will allow you to go out on multi day trips to destinations within that country. The internet has really helped bring people together for this type of opportunity and if you do a little research, you will find a vibrant community of travelers. So, to answer your question.... It depends on what your definition of responsibility is. Personally, I think it will show potential employers the ability to manage and plan a trip of that magnitude and then also show them that you are not opposed to experiencing other cultures. Go out and get it. Just tuck a few grand away so you can get a place to live and buy some food when you return... Or at least have enough for a return ticket to your home country. hahaha"}

All said and done, I wouldn't trade my experiences for anything in the world. My stepdad suddenly passed away a year ago from complications of cancer, and he always encouraged me to do my thing, so that definitely was another \"oh shit\" moment.

Walked across the Golden Gate Bridge, even bought myself a cheesy pin for a buck at the visitor shop saying I did so, haha!"}

Like you, I plan on going to grad school soon and want to travel now so I don\u2019t carry the regret of an unrealized traveling dream with me as I settle down into a career. I was a little worried going into it, but I can tell you that I wouldn\u2019t trade my experiences for anything. Costs for traveling, even for \u201cshoestring\u201d budgets, vary considerably. For example, some people consider a $15-20 hotel room to be shoestring while I\u2019d have a hard time paying for more than a $4 dorm room. It all depends on you. That said, if you live frugally you can easily spend $15 a day in South East Asia, plus flights and insurance. Flights will be your biggest cost, so one long trip is more affordable than multiple shorter ones. Going slowly is more affordable as well, as the cost it takes rush across town in a cab or on a tour to see all the sites could cost the same or more than the cost of staying the extra day and using public transport. It\u2019s also more relaxing and enjoyable to not go so fast. If you\u2019re in a high cost of living location like Western Europe or Japan it may not be so true, though you\u2019ll spend months worth of SEA money in just a few days there, so I wouldn\u2019t recommend if you want to last a long time. If you do run out of money, consider teaching English online. If you\u2019re in Asia this would be easy from a time standpoint as most clients are Chinese. $15-$20 an hour goes a long way over here and you don\u2019t even need to work full time. If you want to travel, now is the time. If you\u2019d like any advice from how I keep costs down I\u2019d be happy to help. Good luck!"}

You've got to decide if using your savings to travel is worth it. &#x200B; Another point - these things are rarely black and white. The most likely best answer is 'a mix'. Maybe you can settle your debts, put a bit away for emergency fund, and travel with the rest. See how far that gets you.

My thought is that you travel, but work at the same time. You'll meet all sorts of new people and be able to network which will ultimately help you careerwise, but your savings will also stretch a lot further. Be sure to check out all of the discount sites like secretflying and hacktheflight. There are emails that you can sign up for also. In addition there's a sub on reddit that is called onebag or something like that. I highly suggest visiting there because once you get over to Europe you can travel dirt cheap ($5 - $20 for a flight) if you're willing to board last and only have your carry-on bag. Sometimes it's called a personal item. Regardless, whittle your belongings down to almost nothing and you can fly for pennies. Just wash your clothes in the sink or at a Tesco that has a public washing machine. Buy clothing at a thrift store if needed and give away what won't fit in your bag before you head to the next adventure. At the resale shop near me jeans are $1 and jackets are $2. It's much cheaper to pick up a few items there than it is to pay $60 for a checked bag to each location."}

I admit I did have to sacrifice some things in order to do this but I cannot stress enough how much it has impacted me in a good way. I personally think that traveling is very important for everyone and exchange programs in schools should be mandatory. In my opinion there is nothing that can open you up to new experiences and ways of thinking and breakdown your preconceptions of other cultures as travel. You will meet people, experience cultures, and be forced to step out of your comfort zone often and each time you will realize how little you truly knew. I grew up in a fairly multicultural city and had friends from countries who moved to or did exchange programs where I lived but it was not until I moved abroad to travel that I had really eye-opening experiences and learned so much about who I am. I learned that many of the people I consider my closest friends played the same childhood games as I did but from cultures and countries that are so different than the one I grew up in. So many of the things I was taught were deeply engrained in \u201cmy culture\u201d are the exact same things so many cultures consider a core part of theirs. I think the best thing anyone can do for themselves is to travel abroad and I don\u2019t mean on family vacation where you stay in a fancy hotel with other tourists and only visit the tourist areas. Force yourself out of your comfort zone, open yourself up to new experiences, listen and talk to the people around you. All of the experiences you have abroad will be useful in some aspect. Maybe you learn a new language or parts of a few. Maybe you learn to cook a new meal. Perhaps you learn new skills from the people you meet or to think about things from a different angle. Not every experience will be good, and not every experience will broaden your horizons, but the overall takeaway from traveling has generally been hugely beneficial to myself and those that I know who have also done some traveling."}

I'd suggest working for a few more months to smash out your debt and adding whatever you can to the kitty and just go. Have money for when you come back and make smart choices when you are on the road. You can easily travel cheap these days. Find the cheap flight hacks, volunteer in hostels, couch surf, learn to cook well with a few ingredients, rent a local room for a month as opposed to a hostel etc Alternatively you can get the best of both worlds if you get a working holiday visa in a country that has good wages. For example the working holiday visa in Australia is good if you prep well and get a job asap. 20 plus bucks an hour and Asia is just a cheap flight away once you wrap up the visa. You won't regret travelling as long as you are smart about it before, during and afterwards. Money can always be made and this world is too big and awesome with only one lifetime to see it.

There are options for extremely flexible work while you travel, e.g. teaching English online through a site like VIP kids for example (I have no experience with it, but met others who recommended it.) Maybe easier to sign up for a site like Workaway though, where you work a few hours a day in exchange for a free place to stay and usually some meals, and you can still travel freely between gigs.

In a decade when you're more stable, this type of trip won't have the same magic as it will now when you're younger. On a side note if you have school debt I'd look into paying it off asap, depending on what the interest rate is. Also, invest what you have in a low cost whole market index ETF. Getting started investing while you're young is one of the best things you can do for yourself financially. Source: have masters degree in personal financial planning"}

The following link talks about the Iowa International Teaching job fair [teaching article]( , where many of my colleagues started. But one of the issues I have with the article is that, unless you are already retired and collect pension/SS, Europe is never an affordable place to work for an American. The best-paying jobs are in Asia or the Mid-East. I got my job posting my resume at TIE (The International Educator) years ago. There are also 2 international head-hunting companies: ISS (International School Services) and Search Associates. Putting your information on one of them is good - but very expensive and time-consuming- as most directors/principals will look there and now contact you directly. However, you may still need to go to the job fairs. My husband loves them, I hate them because it is so crazy. And, just to clarify , most of the schools aren\u2019t that great when you first start. So we always look on Internationalschoolsreview (and pay the subscription for the year we are job searching). Make sure it\u2019s \u201cschools\u201d with an \u201cs\u201d because the one without is a scam. International teachers rate and review the schools they work with. Since we all tend to complain about most things, I only worry about schools with more than 12 recent bad reviews and read between the lines. Directors/superintendents also move from school to school, so that can change the level of a school. I hope that helps."}

Use for: * Setting fare alerts * Exploring nearby airports * Calendar-based fare comparisons * Tracking price trends over time * Use incognito mode and consider trying with a VPN set to India, Malaysia, or Turkey for regional price variations. * [Skyscanner]( & [Kayak]( * Use the \u201cEverywhere\u201d or Explore function to discover cheap destinations from your departure point. * Kayak is great for open-ended searches and some flexible alerts. * [Matrix ITA Software]( Ideal for complex itineraries and multi-city bookings. Requires more manual input. * [FlightConnections]( Visual tool to understand which cities have direct or indirect flights to your target destination. * [Rome2Rio]( Great for planning land/ferry options from a cheaper gateway city (e.g., fly into Helsinki, train to Rovaniemi). * [Skiplagged]( Shows \"hidden city\" tickets. Use cautiously, as skipping legs can violate airline policy and cause issues. **Common Pitfalls** * Third-Party Booking Sites to Be Wary Of: * Kiwi, Hopper, eDreams, Opodo, and some deals on Expedia are consistently reported as problematic. * Main issues: * No help during flight delays or cancellations. * Hard or impossible to get refunds. * Poor customer service, especially during crises. * You\u2019re technically not the airline's customer \u2014 you're the agency's. * Rule of thumb: Use aggregators for research, then book directly on the airline\u2019s website. **Booking Tips & Techniques** * Book international flights 3\u20136 months in advance. For domestic routes, watch 21/14/7-day fare spikes. * Set alerts early using Google Flights or Skyscanner. * Check alternate nearby airports. Sometimes a drive (e.g., Salt Lake to Las Vegas or Boise to Seattle) can save hundreds. * Fly into a cheap hub, then book budget carriers onward (e.g., fly to Dublin, then Ryanair to Finland). * Consider stopovers manually if airlines don\u2019t offer them (e.g., book Salt Lake \u2192 Reykjavik \u2192 Helsinki \u2192 Rovaniemi separately). * One-way vs Round-trip: * Round-trips are often cheaper on legacy carriers (especially US ones). * But two one-ways give flexibility and allow DIY layovers. **Points, Miles, and Credit Cards** * Consider using travel cards like Chase Sapphire Preferred or United Explorer Card to earn miles and access travel portals if available. * Learn airline alliances (Oneworld, Star Alliance, SkyTeam) to maximize point transfers and redemptions. * Points can be especially powerful when traveling with multiple people, so start accumulating well in advance. **Advanced Tricks** * VPN trick: Switch browsing region to a low-cost country for cheaper fares (works inconsistently). * Check non-searchable airlines: Some don\u2019t appear on Google Flights or OTAs. * Minimum Connection Times (MCTs): Use IATA data to ensure enough time between flights if self-transferring. * \u201cAirline generosity\u201d: Legacy carriers like Delta or United may rebook you during disruptions; budget ones won\u2019t. * Use cashback sites or gift card promos for small additional savings. **Baggage, Stopovers, and Miscellaneous** * Carry-on enforcement is unpredictable but can be strict on Ryanair, WizzAir, and other LCCs. Stick to official limits. * Travel light if hopping between multiple budget airlines \u2014 luggage fees add up quickly. * Try a multi-leg strategy: E.g., Fly to a major hub (like NYC), then take a budget carrier to Europe. * Stopover programs: Icelandair, TAP Portugal, and Finnair allow free or low-cost stopovers \u2014 check their websites. * Rome2Rio + Train/Ferry: Consider overland/ferry legs if it means flying into a cheaper nearby country (e.g., Helsinki + train to Lapland). **Travel Protection** * Consider travel insurance, especially if: * Booking through a 3rd party * Using budget carriers * Traveling during weather-sensitive seasons * Know EU Air Passenger Rights (EC 261): You may be entitled to compensation for delays or cancellations on EU-based flights. **Final Reminders** * Always double-check airport codes (e.g., San Jose CA vs. San Jos\u00e9, Costa Rica). * If flying with family, weigh convenience and risk: combining multiple budget airlines may save money but increases risk of disruptions. * The r/Shoestring community itself is a great resource, so don\u2019t hesitate to post your itinerary for help."}

If you have not yet, you should read the advisory here: Guatemala has a program called the Tourist Assistance Program (ASISTUR) that helps protect tourists. ASISTUR works with tourist police (DISETUR) in popular areas like Antigua, Lake Atitl\u00e1n, Tikal, Quetzaltenango, Puerto Barrios, and Coban. They also have an emergency call center that speaks both Spanish and English. Tourist groups can request a security escort if they have safety concerns. You can call them anytime by dialing 1500 from a Guatemalan phone number or (502) 2290-2810, and you can also reach them on WhatsApp at +502-5188-1819. With that said, the host family will know the situation well since they are living in it. Could be that the violence is isolated to specific areas which they know and will have you avoid.

Some of my roommates got caught up at a bar thing, and tangled with the wrong people. Nothing ever happened to them, but you do have to always exercise caution. I highly recommend a cafe called \u201cthe Mandarina\u201d. Great food for good prices. Close to the school. Antigua is even safer than both. There\u2019s plenty of foreigners hanging out there. They have all kinds of trendy food stuff. There\u2019s no dogs there. I walked out at night and didn\u2019t really feel threatened or scared. But it\u2019s oh so worth it!

When I tell you this was the most life changing trip and Atitlan was the most magical place I\u2019ve ever been it\u2019s an understatement. Life changing. Now there are some common sense things that should apply to anywhere: don\u2019t go bar crawling because that\u2019s an easy way to put yourself in danger, keep a hold of your bag and watch for any knife marks on it. No one really threatens other people directly but occasionally locals will slit a bag to look for valuables. Dress appropriately for the area. We stayed in a very conservative indigenous area and there were tourists walking through the streets in bikinis which is highly offensive and a dick move. The other thing is that Mexico City overbooked my flight and we didn\u2019t end up landing until after dark. Normally I would just camp in the airport but because we were meeting up with experienced travelers they drove us to Antigua anyway and there is some concern in the larger cities about driving at night since some gangs will set off fireworks to try and pop your tires. Once we were out of the big city the people were so patient and kind and other than Costa Rica I\u2019ve never felt safer while traveling."}

Time constraints and covering all the important places according to your taste make it very tough to manage them. You are not from the place, so it's difficult to collaborate with local people. And for that we start our research to collect the data for our journey. where to start first, where to go, where to eat, etc. Travel isn't only to go to places, take pictures and come back; it is more than that. Whenever you visit any place for the first time, it's very difficult to go to that place again because every person wants to visit more different places, and for the same place, we cannot invest a huge amount again. So it's our priority to enjoy our first visit as much as possible. Going with a customised itinerary for this helps us a lot. We all know management is very important in all cases. So why not in travel? Not that school picnic type, but according to your taste, so that whenever you think about your trip, you never feel that this was not a worthwhile trip."}

Any small town throughout the country, will probably be able to accommodate that monthly cost. But none of the bigger cities. Even Palermo in Sicily, depending on how you want to 'live' will range from a low $850/month to a Digital Nomad average of $3,000.

Without a car, the countryside would be almost impossible. And public transportation in the sense of buses to get around? Most of the buses are village-to-village, as all of the villages and towns are fairly walk-able. However, there are buses to other towns/cities leaving frequently (each bus company, including TrenItalia, has at least 5-6 buses a day leaving and arriving). And that's a great question! Here's where things can get tricky. I'm super lucky/privileged since my mom actually moved to Italy before me (jus sanguinis, we're both American, as is my wife), so I already had an \"in\". Even with that in, people were super resistant to renting to someone (my wife) who needed to use that apartment as their official residence since many of the apartments available for rent here are already someone's official residence, so they're just renting them under the table while trying to keep it as their own official residence. We got pretty lucky finally finding someone who would take a contract and let us rent while using the apartment as an official residence. If we had to come here without any sort of \"in\", it would definitely be harder, but not impossible. If you know Italian, that's a huge plus. Immobliare/Idealista do have things available, but most things are word-of-mouth. You can also try to contact a real estate office, depending where you want to end up. As much as I dislike AirBnB, trying to find a place for a month in a small town is enough time for people to be familiar with you and not as suspicious when you start asking around for a longer-term contract. In my experience, people have been genuinely ecstatic that people want to move to any small town in southern Italy since they're all pretty much dying, so when we started putting out the word in the town we live in now, it didn't take too long to find an apartment."}

And if the OP is super intent on moving to Italy, I wanted to explain that it's totally possible to live within that budget, depending on where they choose.

But the trains do connect all the bigger 'cities' in Calabria: Consenza, Crotone, Reggio di Calabria, Catanzaro, Vibo Valentina, and then many of the smaller towns along those routes. Similar connections in Sicily. But so many people / tourists are used to HIGH SPEED train routes, and these are almost exclusively REGIONAL trains. Which still get you from Point A to Point B, but have more local stops. I don't know if I've ever used high speed trains in Europe in 25+ years and solely rely on regional trains when I travel there. They save me money and still get me from point A to Point B. But some places (looking at you Germany) will have delays and cancellations. And like I said, Italy, and especially SOUTHERN Italy runs on its own time and schedules are a loose suggestion. As for safety, organized crime is still definitely a role in daily local life in Calabria, maybe also Sicily still. But just use typical common sense and avoid arguments / fights. Keep an eye on your belongings, and mind you business. All things any typical visitor would do in any city/town in any new place. Maybe it's because my granmother is from the area, maybe it's because I had an amazing life-changing experience on my first trip to Europe while in Calabria, but i really enjoy Calabria and really think it's one of the best places in Italy from the little bit I've explored/visited over the years."}

It included 6 weeks in Patagonia and cheap guided tours of Uyuni, Huayna Potos\u00ed and Amazon (Rurrenabaque for Pampas and Selva). We have hiked a lot which is sometimes cheaper than average days and sometimes more expensive because of park fees. We have a tent, sleeping bags, blow up mattress and small gas cooker with us so don't rent any gear. We have done hostels and hospedajes from Hostelworld, Booking on, Airbnb and iOverlander depending on price and if we could risk turning up for a cheaper price in person. We hitchhiked more than buses in Patagonia because of prices and one internal flight in Argentina because it's cheaper than buses. We did 2 weeks of group Spanish lessons, 1 extra week of private lessons. We did canyoning, whitewater rafting 3 times, 4 day bike packing rental in Argentina, hot springs 5 times and lots more adventure stuff. We tried some local psychedelics too which were neither cheap nor expensive, though when a dealer offered me meth at 5am on a Tuesday morning we politely declined as that certainly was not what we were looking for. If you're doing some volunteering then that'll keep the budget down but so far in Bolivia and Peru it would barely be necessary given I don't think we ever paid more than about 33aud per night for a private room. And Bolivia averaged 15aud per night for a private. If you want to do lots of multi-night hikes then be aware that rentals add up quickly. Doing things without a guide saves a lot generally vs doing a tour, but some places are better value to do as a tour like sacred valley with a one day bus tour where I otherwise tried to connect the sites by local buses and it was a PITA. I recommend buying a tent like the the Nature Hike who rents on Amazon(that's what we're using and it's hard to beat for the price of $170aud). Fixed menu meals (menu del d\u00eda) are good value. The biggest expense which others have which we don't is we barely drink alcohol. We like to party but saw some people sinking three or more $6aud beers everyday, which for two people adds up really fast. We preferred paying cover charges at clubs but getting tipsy at the hostel and then just dancing til we were worn out."}

For budget conscious food, search for a \uc2dc\uc7a5 \"sijang\" (typically) an outdoor market on Naver Map. Or visit a locally owned \ub9c8\ud2b8 \"mart.\" Groceries at larger chains like eMart or LotteMart will be pricier. Lastly, depending where you wander in Seoul, there could be street food in small tents you could get pretty cheap as well. So far your expenses are a function of where you have been dining thus far. Gangnam, Itaewon, and Hongdae are three of the most touristy areas along with Gwanghwamun station where you'll see the main palace nearby. Exploring other areas and visiting local sijangs and marts ought to be helpful. Good luck and feel free to ask me more questions during your stay! \\^\\^"}

I\u2019m about to start my senior year of college, and I\u2019m planning on taking an extended trip to Europe in May of 2026 after I graduate. I\u2019ve traveled a decent amount around Europe before, but those were all family trips on my parents\u2019 dime and this trip will be on my very meager college student budget. I\u2019m wondering if anyone has any tips for seeking out the cheapest possible flights from Denver to really anywhere in Western Europe. Once I\u2019m over there I\u2019m going to be using an Eurail pass, so it doesn\u2019t really matter where I fly into. Is there a certain city or airport I should try to find flights into? Which US city would it probably be cheapest for me to connect in (direct flights from Denver to anywhere in Europe are super expensive)? Are there any Spirit/Frontier-esque airlines that fly internationally? Would it be cheaper to fly into Iceland/Ireland/the UK first and find my way to the mainland later? Is there anything else I should look for or be aware of? Thanks in advance!"}

And for very long trips, it's much faster and cheaper to just fly on a budget airline like Ryanair."}

They have flights to destinations in the EU too, but those are only listed for the next few months. From London, you can either fly or take the train/bus to the continent. If you book the train well in advance, that would probably be the most convenient option. Busses are cheap but take a while, flights are cheap and fast, but you also have to factor in the time and expense of getting to the airport. Busses from London to Stansted airport are often more expensive and time consuming than the subsequent flight."}

From Denver, it might cost less to fly United or American to Europe on a basic ticket which probably includes a carry on bag and meals, which cost extra on the low fare airlines, than to buy a ticket to Vegas or New York to get on a Norse flight and pay for your carry on. More importantly, lots of European airports have departure taxes. Try to fly home from Spain or Portugal to minimize them, and definitely don't fly home from London. Best advice I have for budget travel is to slow down. Moving from one city to another every day costs more money, wastes time packing and unpacking, and causes you to spend most of your time in train stations and on buses, and it's really exhausting. And don't treat your trip like a checklist. Rushing from the Louvre to the Roman Forum to the Parthenon just isn't very interesting. We all do it and we all regret it. Instead, stay in one place for a few more days. Take walks, sip your cappuccino, chew your food and taste it, enjoy the sunshine, and relax. Don't worry if you don't see everything you wanted to see. Europe isn't going anywhere anytime soon. You can go back."}

Booking about three months out is usually the sweet spot but all airline pricing is dynamic and algorithm driven so it varies. If you book earlier than that it's often more expensive. Note that while you can find your flight on Google Flights it's better to go to the airlines website and book directly with them. It'll probably be more expensive but if there's a delay or some other issue with the flight and you've booked through a third party you sometimes end up in the lowest circle of customer support hell where they just blame each other for everything and both parties say everything is the other parties responsibility. It's possible to save money over the strategy I've outlined above but it's not going to turn a 350 dollar ticket into a 35 dollar one, it's going to go from 350 to 335 and might add some risks and other negatives."}

I did Kotor and Perast, and looking back at it, while Perast was very beautiful, the town was kind of dead. So I'd suggest 11 days Albania and 3 days Kotor. Use one day for a day trip to Perast, which is literally, just down the street. In regard to Albania: Gjirokastra, Sarande, Ksamil, Tirana, Theth and Shkoder are the places I went. Since Theth is in the mountains, it was a bit too cold for me, so definitely make sure you stay in a good place with heat!

I have few requirements for my stay. 1) Cleanish room 2) Air conditioning (or heat depending on the time of the year) 3) Hot shower 4) Outlet to recharge my devices 5) Mostly level parking lot with few potholes It's a bonus if the room has a refrigerator and microwave As I lay in a motel room bed realizing I just paid $80+ to sleep I find myself doom channel surfing the TV trying to get some value from my stay. Am I the only one that wishes there was a half price place to stay that sticks with the basics? I really don't need a TV, I'm just getting the room to sleep. The two side chairs and desk? Again I'm just here to sleep! Fancy lighting and micro toiletries, I travel with what I like. I just want to get a shower and sleep. I'll wakeup early in the morning and hit the road. Would there be any appeal to people other than myself for a motel with a basic bed, toilet and shower? The room could be nearly half size, even with a king bed. The heating/cooling burden would also be smaller for the smaller room. Removing the TV's and associated cable bill and half the lights would all greatly reduce the cost to run. Even the microtels are outrageous in cost for what little many travelers get from them. Still far too much furniture, nothing worth watching on the provided TV and overpriced decor for a place you're just sleeping in."}

Never once had an issue. In Florida, most rest areas have security. They are a pretty safe bet. Wyoming, the Dakotas, some of Colorado, Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas have quite a bit of BLM you can tent camp on for free, just don't build bon fires or do anything stupid and you won't get hassled. Now that I think of it, most of the western states have lots of BLM land. I've never been rousted, but on more than a few occasions I kinda freaked myself out. Some of those places can get creepy at night. Wal-Mart used to let you crash their parking lots overnight, but I think that may have changed. If you're gonna be in more metropolitan areas, spring for a gym membership at a big name gym so you can always shower. Even in the summer, if you're north of Denver, it'll be plenty cool at night for sleeping. The problem is, if you're in the northern latitudes of the US or into Canada, nights are only about 5 hours long in June and July. In the winter, the days are about 5 hours long. It sucks in both cases. Fuck Arizona, Nevada and Southern California. Those areas might be okay in the winter, but they have NO sense of humor in the summer."}

Or take two weeks if you can, self drive in Kruger Park for 5 nights by flying Jhb - Hoedspruit/Skukuza, then come out via Hoedspruit, fly to Cape Town, then back pack/self drive Cape Town, winelands, up route 62, Wilderness, and then back to CT /Gqeberha via the Garden Route. Namibia and Botswana are both safe, but it depends on your budget as big distances and Okavango is pricey in season. Malawi, Zimbabwe and Zambia perhaps, but I wouldn't start there. Morocco can be back packed.. but that's not real Africa imo, although also amazing. If you don't want to backpack, Kenya and Tanzania are fantastic for a week safari and culture.

It did not say you had to pay an upfront deposit But because the room was nonrefundable and I had already paid for it I either pay the deposit or give up $250 so I pay the deposit which they did return to me but after two weeks I still cannot get them to give me an invoice and the booking company says I have to go through them the property managers so here is another issue. This was not a motel. This was an apartment. This was basically an Airbnb it was not advertised that way in fact it said it was a one bedroom private bath. It turned out. It was a two bedroom apartment with a shared bath. Also said there was an on-site gym my husband could not find it amongst the thousands of apartments. And has this is basically un rented apartments that the management company is renting out as an Airbnb on a motel site I had to pay a $60 cleaning fee, but there were also two other charges on my receipt that said other and I still cannot get any response from the management company. They are based out of Illinois and this apartment is in Indiana and the booking company is in another country. Any advice"}

Learn how to find good spots (out of sight, sheltered, away from shady parts of a town). You won't sleep well but that's fine beceause you're young. Allow yourself a bed and a shower every 2-3 days. To rest and also to avoid stinking. If going to a hostel: ask if you can sleep on the roof or in the kitchen or anything for a discount. \\- Pack light and fast. You might have to change spots/leave quickly at some points. Don't bother with tents or camping stoves or gadgets or anything. A sleeping bag, a mat and a bag with some clothes and hygiene essentials (essentials!) will suffice. If it rains: find shelter. In need for a warm meal: buy it. \\- Always have some cheap nutritous and filling food on you. Think peanuts, canned beans, dried fruit and so on. Not too much, just to get by for a day. Pack a decent pocket knife. \\- Small villages are generally a whole lot safer than cities. And you're more likely to meet people, however contradictory that might sound. \\- Avoid contact with drunks, junkies and the likes. Even if they seem friendly. Don't think you're tough. You're playing 'on the streets'. Others are 'the streets', are wayyyy tougher and are living lifes you can't imagine. Always keep, or at least play, calm and cool though. This WILL happen. And yeah, for the record: do avoid any kind of r\u00e9ally dangerous situation. No amount of saved money or 'experience' is worth real danger. Don't get too drunk if there's anything shady about a situation. \\- Don't look like a bum. Don't show off riches either. \\- Don't be paranoid, most (99%?) people are nice, good people. For me this was perhaps the most striking and beautiful revelation during travels. People are mostly curious, so be friendly, polite and open. Don't refuse invitations, be it for a bed, a dinner, a shot of rakija or a coffee. Be generous yourself when the time is right. Both to yourself and to others. \\- you'll encounter police at some point. Be friendly and polite, even if they're not. \\- Trust your gut. Can't stress it enough. \\- And damn, enjoy!"}

Of course this is very costly, so I want to time all the countries correctly for when they seem relatively cheap. In the past and currently, I\u2019ve used Google Flights for this. You can pick your origin city, say you have flexible dates and destination, and see a map of round-trip fares to hundreds of destinations. Even more helpful is that you can filter by max price! The problem is that this feature has a severe limitation. That is, the flexible dates mode forces you to have *exactly* either a 2-day (weekend), 7-day, or 14-day trip length. Obviously many factors go in to pricing airline tickets, meaning there\u2019s plenty of cases where having a flexible number of total days would yield a cheaper rate. I gave Skyscanner and Hopper a shot today. Skyscanner is close, since it lets you select any trip duration, but it has no filters (i.e. cost, region, excluded countries, etc.) until you\u2019ve already picked a city, and it doesn\u2019t seem to find some of the ultra-cheap international flights that Google flights does because I believe it\u2019s pulling from another data source. Hopper didn\u2019t get me as far because it doesn\u2019t seem to have a flexible destination mode I could find. Does anyone have any suggestions for sites or apps you use for this purpose? Cheers!"}

Sometimes there are long layovers and you can use that to go visit the transit country as well. A tip is to look at the airline they're offering online and see the reviews. For accomodation, Agoda, expedia, airbnb are in my researches. I also look at tripadvisor for candid photos. I do know that some people use trusted house sitter as a way to stay at free accomodation in exchange for pet sitting. I have not tried it yet but i know some people use it and have success. So maybe look into it if it's something you're into. If Japan is too expensive, Thailand comes very close. They have a good amount of japanese community there as well. Food is good, the transit system is robust, you can stay at nice accomodation for a cheap price. Vietnam is also good as well. But if you're a newbie i suggest getting your feet wet with mexico first. Traveling to SEA and dealing with jet lag can feel horrible on your first trip."}

Don\u2019t wait. The first thing you should do is get an airline branded credit card with a large sign-up bonus. Ideally choose a card without an annual fee and at least 50 to 80,000 miles or points for signing up. That award as they are called will generally get you a round-trip ticket from the US to Europe or from the US to South America with some extra to spare. Search online resources like the points guy and airlinecreditcards.com for more information. Good luck and good travels."}

Second, if you are a female traveling solo, the first thing to consider is safety. Honestly, you are young enough to consider changing your career to something in the travel industry. Work for an airline (that will give you discounted flights). You would start domestic, but, if you stick with it, you can go international. You can do the same working for a hotel company. Your biggest costs for travel will be airline and hotel stays, if you can cut those costs through your job, that would help. There really isn't a place that is \"cheap\". Overall, Mexico will probably be a good place to start. You can do city, or beach, or both. Mexico City is great, but again, safety first. Thailand is also \"cheap\" to eat and sleep, but getting there can be expensive, and the language barrier can be a problem if you go on your own. Perhaps consider joining a travel group. There are MANY companies out there that cater to solo travel. That way you will be with other travelers and you can make friends who have common interests. It may cost a little more to do this, but, it's worth it. Good luck."}

Not typically cheap, many high end options but there are also several lower priced hotel and lower priced food options. For cheap, try Thailand, Seim Reap Cambodia, or Shanghai , but may be too overwhelming for a first International trip. There is a lot to see in the US if you don't care about trying to impress your friends. Every national park is interesting. South Dakota (Mount Rushmore) may seem more foreign than Vancouver BC. Quebec City would seem plenty different though. Belize is cheap and awesome, and English speaking. Safe if you avoid going south to Belize City from the airport. The islands are more expensive for food than the jungle. But Caye Caulker is awesome. El Tunco, El Salvador is also cheap and safe. For flights, check flights.google.com and sites like Scott's cheap flights. Travel midweek for cheapest fares.

A lot of people already commented on it. I\u2019d like to add that there are a lot of places, especially in California, that you could visit in the mean time, in case you haven\u2019t been there already. It is something you could do while saving up for the big international trip. Pick a destination and do a weekend trip. Use it as opportunity to learn how to research and plan your trip itinerary, see how you feel about solo traveling, and gain some experience to prepare yourself for the big trip. \u2022 First off, regardless of your destination, as a solo female traveler, always be street smart, and always be aware of your surroundings. Never put yourself in a dubious or dangerous situation. \u2022 If you own a car and like driving, see if there are interesting places within 2-5 hour range that you could go. However, given the cost of gas, and not having anyone to split the expense with, driving may or may not be the most cost effective mode of transportation when traveling alone. \u2022 If you live in a California city that has Amtrak station, there are many interesting cities you could visit via Amtrak. You could go as far south as San Diego (from which you could go visit Tijuana, Mexico if you\u2019d like) and north to the Bay Area, and all the way up to Oregon and Washington. There are many stops in Southern and Central California including Los Angeles, Santa Barbara & San Luis Obispo, Monterey, and Santa Cruz that you could make a day trip or a weekend trip out of. (Monterey is my favorite place in the world) Some portion of the track that the Pacific Surfliner line runs on also gives you access beautiful ocean scenery that you don\u2019t get to see from the HWY. think that the experience counts as a discount/extra value you get from the fare. You might also be more refreshed when you arrive at the destination. Several of the stops would drop you off right on the downtown / tourist areas. If you could plan it as a day trip that begins early in the morning and return home a little later in the evening, then you save on lodging, which kinda sucks for solo travelers, coz it could have been a lot cheaper if you could split it with someone. Anywho, always look into different ways to get deals on the ticket. See if there is a pass available (and double check that it is indeed a better deal) or if there is a way to ride for cheap. For example, in LA and vicinity area, you could ride on Amtrak train with a cheaper Metrolink ticket (regional commuter train) through their code-share agreement, as long as you travel on the route that the metrolink train services. Lastly, if you are young enough to spend the night on the train on the cheap seat, and not be too tired to explore the city the next day, you could see if there is any overnight route that you could hop on in the evening and wake up in another city the next morning. Maybe spend the next night there. Then do the same on the way back. I don\u2019t know if this is always an option, train schedule-wise, but if you could find such schedule, it will save you time and cost for lodging, as well as potentially allowing you to explore places further away from your home base. You could also apply this concept to your international trip to places with good and abundant rail system like Europe. \u2022 Choose destinations that offer free or low cost activities once you get there, from outdoor activities such as beaches, parks, or hiking trails, to urban festivities or cultural sites such as local shops, flea/farmers market, or missions/churches/city hall that feature interesting architecture. Not everything you do have to be free, but having the ability to mix these types of activities with other things that require admission could help keep the cost under control. \u2022 For places that require admission, always check in advance if you could get the ticket at lower price with coupon or discount code. \u2022 Public museums, parks, botanical gardens, that usually charge admission fee sometimes have free admission days. Plan your trip to coincide with the free admission day when possible. Sometimes it\u2019s every Friday, or maybe it\u2019s every second Tuesday of the month. Or sometimes it\u2019s a special week out of the year. For example, there is one week out of the year, usually in April where the Italian government waive all admission fees to all of state owned museums, which include many major should not miss museums of Italy. Once upon a time, many many years ago, I took a month long trip through Europe. And I planned it so that the Italy portion of the trip coincided with the culture week. Saved me a lot of money right there. \u2022 Checking out local food, breweries, or wineries is a great way to experience the places you visit. But the cost for eating out every meal could add up quickly. Try packing a sandwich, snacks, and a drink from home for lunch, treat it like a fancy picnic with a view, and save your dining out budget for dinner. Even better if you can time your itinerary and find a place that offers happy hour deals. \u2022 Getting to know about history, culture, food, their natural flora/fauna, etc etc, whichever is applicable, while planning the trip and before you arrive at the destination will make your trip so much more enjoyable and rewarding. That\u2019s all I could think of for now. Hope you enjoy your trip, whatever it may take you."}

DISCLAIMER: I know everyone's situation is different and not everyone can do what I am suggesting because of personal/familial/other responsibilities or disabilites. OP mentions none of this, so I am sharing my own experience as advice to OP. I wanted to go to Europe for 2 weeks with friends when we were in college. THey had parents that could foot the bill for them. Mine could not. I REALLY wanted to go, so I prioritized that rip over almost everything else. I took a semester off university and worked 2 jobs, both at full time hours (40+ hours each per week). The pay at each sucked, but it allowed me to save for the 4-5 months I had to do it. I hated it, but I really wanted to go. While I was working and saving I came across a book called 'Europe Through the back Door', by a guy named Rick Steves. I'd never heard of it or him, but I read it cover to cover in a weekend between jobs. On the Monday i excitedly called my friends and told them we could spend the ENTIRE SUMMER in Europe for the same budget we had planned for 2 weeks! They laughed at me. THeir parents thought I was naive. I decide that I'd do it myself. I bought a backpack, a rail pass, a moneybelt, and the cheapest most flexible airline 'ticket' I could find (that another wild story). I told my friends I would meet up with them when they were in Europe and travel with them for those 2 weeks, but I'd be staying in hostels instead of fancy hotels, using trains instead of the rental car, eating at local places or markets instead of tourist restaurants, and strictly budgeting my money so i could spend the summer exploring Europe. They thought I was nuts until I left a week before they did. By the time I met them in Rome a week later, I'd met a ton of other backpackers traveling around Spain and southern France just like me. THey shared amazing stories from their traveles and travel hacks to save money and stay on budget. In one week i was a much more confident and competent traveler than I was before leaving home. After my friends left for home 2 weeks later, I continued my adventures through Europe and the UK for another 2.5 months. I've been obsessed with budget European travel ever since and can't wait to show my own kids how amazing and affordable backpacking through Europe (or anywhere) can be. TLDR: Work, save, and go. No matter what anyone else tells you. It's amazing and will be some of the greatest memories of your life. But of course: Be safe and travel smart."}

Yes off season is cheaper but there\u2019s a reason for it - the weather won\u2019t be as nice and it will impact what you need to pack (ie warm clothes and boots for cold weather, rainwear, etc). I think Mexico is a good place to start given your proximity to it. Most touristic areas are quite easy to navigate even if you don\u2019t speak Spanish and the weather is generally nice. I would recommend La Paz in BCS (Mexico, not Bolivia). Developed enough but not too touristy. It felt like a real city where real people live, not just a place full of resorts that was built for tourists. But maybe the resort vibe is what you\u2019re looking for and that\u2019s totally fine too. I know it\u2019s in the US but have you considered Hawaii? It\u2019s not exactly cheap but there are ways to keep the costs down and I\u2019m sure flights are cheap from CA. It\u2019s very different from the continental US and could help you build your confidence before you go to a different country. Just a thought. For planning purposes there are tons of websites and blogs out there with great tips for finding cheap flights, what to pack, etc. Make sure your passport is valid for 6 months after your return date. I like to use Google Flights to find the best flights to anywhere as it allows to keep the destination field open and you can enter multiple departure airports for more options. The best way to save on flights is to be flexible on dates and destination. Always book your flight with the actual airline though, not with third party websites. For lodging I use Hostelworld.com for hostels or booking.com for hotels in North America and Europe. Agoda is better for Asia. Hostels are great for meeting people and are much cheaper than hotels. Most have female only dorms. They also usually organize group activities like food tours, etc. Make sure you have travel insurance that will cover trip interruption/cancellation, baggage loss and medical expenses. Many credit cards cover trip cancellation, delays, luggage theft, etc but won\u2019t provide health insurance. If going to a tropical country (including Mexico) consult a travel clinic at least 2-3 months before departure to make sure you\u2019re up to date on your immunizations, get a prescription for antibiotics and bring Imodium (or equivalent). Traveller\u2019s diarrhea is no joke. I\u2019m a planner so I like to do a lot of research beforehand so I know how to get around (is Uber a thing there? Is public transport generally safe and reliable? Is it safe to walk around?), what areas to avoid, common scams to be on the lookout for, tourist traps vs attractions that are worth it, must-try foods, etc. I like having a general itinerary with all my flights and lodging booked ahead of time but I make sure to leave free time to just wander around and \u2018get lost\u2019. Travelling is amazing and can be life changing. Don\u2019t overplan and don\u2019t get frustrated or discouraged when things don\u2019t go according to plan, don\u2019t sweat the small stuff, engage with the local culture, have fun, and be safe. Please update us when you decide where to go. Also feel free to dm me if you\u2019d like to chat more. I\u2019ve solo travelled a fair bit (I\u2019m a woman too)."}

If you are in the region and you enjoy nature, I'd suggest you visit Nakuru, Naivasha, Aberdare, Mt Kenya, Kilimanjaro, or even Victoria Falls, Namibia and South Africa (a bit far yes).

Then there are smaller attractions, cheaper parks..Arusha has a bunch of small attractions - lakes, waterfalls, Moshi springs, mountains, masai land, craters, sometimes you need a local to show you though. Use Google maps and zoom in on Arusha and search for tour agencies and safaris. Pay a small deposit for the tour. Or even just arrive - tours are going all the time. Ngoro ngoro crater is amazing too. Arusha national park has a walking safari cheaper. There's a hiking group hiking every Saturday or Sunday in Arusha, forgot their name. Try to find the expat WhatsApp group for Arusha here or on Facebook, link up with someone who lives there and ask for advice. Also consecutive safari days mean early wake ups, spending 8-12 hours in the car sitting. I am tired after just the one day. The most I've done is 2 day safari drives in a row, and I was tired. You could always try to fit spending one whole day at the hotel and going the following day, as the hotels are often with nice views and you can explore the area a bit and relax."}

Also, it's where the Tibetan government in exile is and there is a great deal of Tibetan/Buddhist culture mixed with Indian/Hindu culture. It's very interesting and they say it has a great energy that peaceful and relaxing. From there you can try other parts of India. Also, I hear Viet Nam, Laos and Cambodia are very inexpensive. You may in fact find India has more to offer at your price range. It has a learning curve but many people love it. Plus, it's very English friendly (in terms of the language). I think Dharmsala may be a good entry point for exploring more of India, but the weather is cooler there. This is great in summer while the rest of India bakes, but it has a real winter. You can buy cashmere sweaters, scarves and gloves real cheap as it's next to Kashmir, a place that is also legendary for hashish, if you like that type of thing."}

In the touristy places like arusha, zanzibar, maun there are quite a few hostels, but often you need to stay in smaller towns to get where you are going. There are still places to stay but they may be very very basic. Sometimes a a concrete room with a bed, no power and no running water. Sometimes a sandy shack if you are on the coast. There are also upmarket hotels, but they tend to be expensive. We camped about a third of the time, hostels, homestays, and cheaper lodges, basic rooms rest of the time. Camping safaris are much cheaper than lodge ones. Some if the lodges have a camping option which js great because you can still eat at the restaurant, use the pool etc. Occasionally you might get stuck - we did a couple times, some locals we were on mini buses with found basic hotels (just rooms) for us. Another time the local policeman let us stay (very reluctantly) in his police station - which was just a basic but clean mud hut and we slept on the floor.

In general prices were around $12-15 a night for guesthouses - you don't find that many hostels in Africa it is mainly cheap guest houses where you get your own room. Otherwise Etosha National Park in Namibia is cheap safari - only $8 for a ticket to enter the park and 4 hour game drives are available for about $50 by joining a group. . Chobe National Park in Botswana also has cheap safari. Stay at nearby Elephant Trails hostel and they have safari jeeps leaving every day. National ParkTicket is $25 then a 6 hour game drive is $50 and a 3 hour river safari on the River Chobe is $25. Do both in one day so your 24 hour ticket covers both activities. For just $100 you will see thousands of animals, we saw a pack of lions killing a buffalo and also a leopard with their kill up a tree. There are thousands of elephants in Chobe, huge big herds of them. Another place is Elephant Sands in Botswana if you have a tent.. There you camp beside the waterhole and about 40-50 elephants show up every day right near your tent.

Like most public travel we left hashims before dawn on a truck and got to the next junction town, then a ute dropped us at the next village. We git there quite early in the day maybe about 9am\u2026and then we waited and waited along with 4 or 5 others. A crowd of bored locals surrounded us at nightfall, the others (no tourists just other mozambiqueans) got offered to spend the night in village houses which left us by the side of the road. Eventually someone got the off duty policeman. He didn\u2019t speak english but he let us stay in the police station. He told us not to touch anything which was okay because there was nothing but a bare desk in the hut. The next morning eventually a ute came to take us to the fishing port to Ibo. It happened to be the same ute that had dropped us off the day before. We tried to charter the ferry (just a dhow) to get us to Ibo rather than wait 8 hrs for the scheduled time. We got there eventually. Ibo was interesting but very quiet. There seemed to only be maybe 2 others tourists there staying at an upmarket lodge (we had lunch there because options were very limited), an NGO from portugal doing some education work and a couple who were hotel sitting a boutique hotel while it was closed for rainy season. Anyway - if you spend long enough in Africa these experiences are kind of normal. Its alot rougher than asia or latin america. You can hire private safaris, drivers etc or hire a car (we hired a car in namibia) but clearly that comes at a cost."}

It wasnt until my 5th safari (which was in the Serengeti in Tanzania) that I saw a cheetah who had two young cubs with her. Some animals can be very elusive so its unlikely you will see everything you want to see just on one safari alone. Some areas are known for a specific animal, like Etosha is the last stronghold of the white rhino which is endangered but you should see lots of them in that park. Whereas further north in Kenya/Tanzania it is very difficult to see rhinos. They are there but not in the numbers that Etosha has."}

The best investment I have ever made when traveling through Europe was a $5 money belt. I carried my identification, passport, money, and credit cards, even a small mobile phone fits in it. You can find them at Walmart, Target, or Amazon. Rick Steve's gave that advice years ago. The best travel advice. Years ago I gave one to a friend who was traveling to Italy. She didn't take it afterwards because she wanted to look good with her handbag instead. Big mistake: She got robbed in a train...She fell asleep in a long trip to Milan, and the robbers managed to grab her purse with all of her documents and money..Instead of enjoying in Milan, she spent the day at a police station, and the US embassy trying to get new documents. When she came back, she told me her ordeal, and how guilty she felt for not using my gift. I thought that she deserved it for being so conceited and wanting to care more about her looks. She could have worn it under her pants. Nobody would have seen it. In your backpack or purse just carry your travel books, maps, any water bottle, a snack, and toiletries. If it gets stolen, you don't lose much. Keep your camera hanging on your neck. Don't carry it in the back. Try to use your mobile device instead for good photos and upload them to your cloud daily. If at that, make sure your photo app is connected to the cloud so that once you do a photo, it automatically goes there to your cloud via Google drive. I say this just in case you lose your phone or if you have it stolen. When in a train, put your backpack and purse to the front. Never behind you. Keep your purse crossed on your chest and to the front. If you are sitting,also put it on the front, never to the side. The same while walking on the street. Make it harder for them to reach. Buy purses or backpacks that are anti-theft. Find them online. PHONES get stolen so some people tie a string to their wrist while they are walking around with the phone in their hands. You can tie the string or a cord to the phone carrier then to your wrist. There are tons of pictures of it online, and videos on YouTube on how to do it. I have seen this in the city streets of Spain and France. Rule #2 Don't take the flower branch a gypsy woman wants to give you, or the friendship bracelet a guy wants to give you. It's all a gimmick to get you to stop and give them money, or get you distracted while another second person steals from you. The woman might want to offer to read your palm or tell you the future. Ignore these people and keep walking, say loudly \"no\". She will yell a curse of some sorts. Don't believe her. It's all a ruse by a group of people that harass travelers near churches or at a public square to steal from them. Rule #3 Plan your route and look at maps or mobile maps before leaving your hotel to visit places. Try to make sure you have your day planned and a note or a piece of paper for the day with the addresses of the locations you want to visit, in case you need to show it to someone like a taxi or uber driver. Don't ask for directions to random people in the street. Find a tourist information office in the area, or enter a store and ask an employee. If you stop at a tapas bar, or supermarket, you might get more information and you avoid being pickpocketed or taken by a person to a the wrong location to then steal from you. Rule #4 Wear comfortable shoes. Avoid high heels, sandals, or anything that is not for long distance walking. You will walk a lot. Maybe even run after a pick pocket person. Rule#5 Respect religious places of worship. Dress appropriately if you are visiting a church. For women if you're wearing a tank shirt or with too much cleavage, bring a scarf or a light cardigan to cover your shoulders. If wearing shorts or short skirt, bring a longer skirt in your bag. Something that is light enough to bring in your bag to wear. Men, take off your hat. You are not going to a baseball game. Rule #6 Before you go, make sure to learn some basic phrases in the language of origin you're visiting. Do not assume everyone there knows your language. Rule #7 Be always on the alert. Europe has seen a large influx in the last couple of years of migrants, and some of them don't want to assimilate to the country's laws or way of life. Therefore there's more pickpocketing and more violence going on, and tourists especially the ones coming from the USA are very gullible and trusting at times, thinking all in Europe is good, but you must be on the alert at all times. Rule#8 Watch videos on how to travel safely in Europe. Enjoy your trip safely!"}

Iceland air does cheap flights often, so I don\u2019t think the price you found is a rare thing that FOMO will pressure you to buy. My tip for Icelandair is to use their stop over program. You can fly on to Europe with Iceland as a layover and you can extend in the country 1-7 days to make it a two country trip."}

And realistically, booking months in advance is a form of flexibility too, not insisting on doing how you may prefer it but adapt to get a better price. In the end, if price is important to you, you need the flexibility to adapt to make use of the better deals. You may have to pay in other ways, time, comfort, convenience etc, so cheap may turn out to be bad value for money. But that is about priorities, about how you balance the pros and cons of different options."}

So I'm guessing I'll have around 8-9 days somewhere between our London visit and wherever we decide to fly home from. I'm looking at Romania currently since it's quite affordable and Transylvania looks beautiful. We'd consider a couple days in Bucharest, then a few in Brasov before heading onto the last leg of our journey. But I'm considering visiting Austria too. Can Austria be done affordably? I was looking at hotel prices and they weren't too outrageous when compared to Seville for instance, but food seems a bit steep. I think we'd do Vienna and perhaps Frankfurt, Salzburg, or Innsbruck. I don't necessarily need somewhere dirt cheap but affordability is one of our metrics. Any other suggestions? Is Austria perhaps not a good candidate country?"}

We went to brasov for a few nights. It was much colder there but still very pleasant overall. There was a delicious and cheap foccacia place right in downtown area. We stayed at Airbnbs, Bucharest was cheap but it was kinda far outside of the actual city, on the last subway stop. That being said, the subway is super fast and efficient there, and very affordable. In brasov we stayed right in the thick of things near the downtown area and the Airbnb was slightly more than we'd normally spend, but it was under 40 eu a night I believe. I highly recommend Romania.I've traveled a lot over the past few years and Romania stood out as one of my favorite stops, even if it was also one of the shortest. Romania moreso than any other place I've been in Europe retains old world sentiments with creature comforts of modernity. The prices are great, people were nice, good awesome, and it's naturally very beautiful. Bucharest ranks as one of my favorite cities, too. It's affordable but it contains lots of culture. Edit : Austria is cool too - I also enjoyed Vienna immensely, but hotels were more expensive and food was more expensive than Bucharest. There's also more to do and it's a bigger city. I didn't explore outside of Vienna into the rest of Austria so I don't know what that's like."}

If this is the first time for both of you, i highly recommend the route and itinerary we took as it is an excellent 'intro' to Europe and its highlights, and gives a little taste of almost everything a first-time visitor could want, all within 2 weeks. 1. London 2. London 3. London - daytrip to 1 or 2 of: Salisbury/Stonehenge, Bath, Windsor Castle 4. Chunnel/Eurostar to Paris 5. Paris 6. Paris - daytrip to Versailles 7. Switzerland (Interlaken for a 'city' and active vibe, Gimmelwald for a 'alpine village, relaxing vibe) 8. Switzerland 9. Cinque Terre 10. Cinque Terre 11. Florence 12. Rome 13. Rome 14. Rome 15. Fly Home Also, something I was told before that first trip with my wife: \"If you can survive a 2-week (or longer) backpacking trip with a significant other, you've found the person to marry\". And man was this true :) Nothing tests you for a life time together than spending 2+ weeks traveling together in a situation like backpacking in a foreign place."}

Look for seasonal round-trip international budget air carriers from a big city close to you to Central Europe (e.g. French Bee, Norwegian, Condor, et. al.) Many budget airlines there. Ryanair, easyJet, and Wizz Air, Vuelling, and Volotea dominate the European budget scene, but for the Middle East, look at Pegasus and Flydubai. They're known for affordable fares. If you are near an airport that has Turkish Airlines, sign up for their Miles and Smiles frequent flyer program which sometimes has great promotional offers. I have flown them many times at great round trip fares from LAX to and beyond Istanbul. They are a global airline with great routes and service. 2. Consider Hostels by booking ahead at the nicest ones (which go fast as summer gets closer). Also some hospitality apps have great offers. 3. For 2 weeks - Consider choosing two or three destinations and explore them. My first timer favorites are Rome, Athens, Istanbul with perhaps a 3-4 day trip to Marrakesh, Morocco, staying at a Riad (like a B&B) in the Medina there. And do sit and charm a cobra in the market place while there! 4. There are tons of things to see and do in and near these cities. Rome, Athens, and Istanbul are very walkable and highly accessible cities. Must see day trips above locations: a. Rome to Florence on the Frecciarossa train from Rome Termini to Florence takes about an hour and 22 minutes. It's a super-fast and comfortable ride. On another day, take the Frecciarossa to Naples and bus to Sorrento. b. Organized tour from Athens to board boat trip to Saronic Islands. It will include a stop at Aegina island, famous for being a headquarters for the Greek Orthodox Church, particularly the Monastery of Saint Nektarios. Plus, it's known for its delicious pistachios. The pistachio ice cream in a little hilltop cafe you will visit is unlike any you will have ever had before. Any \u201cpistachio\u201d ice cream you ever have after that will be a sad disappointment. c. The Blue Mosque (and the nearby underground Basilica Cistern you will recognize from a couple of the John Wick movies), Taksim Square and street, The Grand Bazaar (must see established in the 400\u2019s one of the oldest markets in the world). 5. Between public transport and Uber, getting around in the above 3 cities will be fast and reliable. 6. Beteen destination Internet guides and AI (Co-pilot is my favorite for these topics) these days, discovering what there is to do in these locales has never been easier. [I am 78 yrs old and have lived, studied, or traveled in 92 countries on 7 continents and speak 3 languages. These places will change how you see yourself and the world around you.] Buon viaggio e buon apprendimento!"}

Central Asia", "content": "Total cost: $1300/19 days I visited 4 countries in Asia. Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, and Qatar. Flight: $125 with my American airline points ($1750 cash price) I have my budget broken down by country rather than expense Tajikistan: $175/ 3 days. Mainly hiked in the Fann mountains and stayed in a guesthouse. My guest house was about $20/night and my meals were about $5-$7/meal. Transport was pretty expensive as the area had many unpaved mountainous roads. Uzbekistan: $552/8 days (including Visa fee) Travelled to Tashkent, Samarkand, and Bukhara. Mainly stayed in budget hotels or guesthouses ($30/night). Meals were around $10 at fancy full service restaurants or $5 at more local hole in wall restaurants. Taxis ranged from $1-$4 a ride (I tipped pretty generously). Many attractions charged between $3-$5 to enter though. Kazakhstan: $431/5 days Price includes 4 nights at a budget hotel for $30/night in Almaty, a group tour to some nearby lakes with overnight in a private Yurt ($114), attraction fees for ski lifts, taxis, and rail transport from Uzbekistan ($46 for a first class sleeper cabin). Meals generally were around $5-$15 depending on the establishment and how fancy the restaurant is. Qatar Stopover: $82/1 day. Includes $21 Visa fee for Americans I flew with Qatar Airways, which allowed me to get a 22 hour layover in Doha. Qatar Airways heavily subsidized the hotel, and I only paid $28 for a 4 star hotel. I found Qatar just as affordable as Central Asia surprisingly. Miscellaneous costs: Sim cards: $10 Travel Insurance: $15 Costs I didn't include Misplacing $60 in cash Ubering to and from my home airport. Souvenirs including a $100 rug, silk scarves, and knockoff Tshirts."}

They send alerts for mistaken fares, sudden drops, and uncommon changes you may be able to save huge $ from. - Don't be afraid to tinker with the options. For example, with your flight itenerary, open Google Flights and look at flights from SYD, MEL, BNE, etc. and also going to AUH, DXB, etc. Doing this will check all permutations for each set of targets and show your best deal for that day. Once you see a pattern of cheapest flights, search only that departure/arrival combo and you should be able to see the calendar and prices for each date to/from your destination. - Booking through the host website is almost always cheapest. Some sketchier sites will advertise on Google Flights for cheaper rates, but a) often they're unreliable, and b) if you have any issues, complaints, or need rebooking in your travels, you'll be screwed. Usually they can claim moderate savings, $100 or less, but in my experience it's not been worth it. - Lastly, if you're really tinkering, find a major intermediate hub and see if you can find a cheaper pair of flights instead of flying direct. Remember, if you say you want to fly SYD-DXB, Google Flights and most other carriers will offer only direct and in-partner flights. That means flights that aren't partnered will be ignored. For this example, you may find a cheaper flight to say Doha, Singapore, Kuala Lampur, etc and then find a completely different airline for the next leg. This is time-intensive to search, but can often be rewarding if $ is your biggest issue. I've used it extensively flying from the US to places in Western Asia and the Middle East, as once you're in Europe there are a ton of budget airlines that can get you the next leg, but none are partnered with the airlines I'd be flying over the pond with. I find setting up a little spreadsheet to keep track of the costs useful when going through the permutations with this method as well. Best of luck!"}
