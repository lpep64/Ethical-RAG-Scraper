Is this user error? Do I have a misunderstanding of the feature? I can’t imagine that the lyrics feature is just universally broken throughout the app but I don’t really know what else to try.

But since it’s my first time, I took over 9 hours of research/reading the post again and again/attempts. WHAT I AM NOT UNDERSTANDING: 1. How KSign even installed and had that “trust” thing in the settings while 99.9% of other apps (I guess called IPAs) will not have that in settings ? If it’s certified from Khoidvn, maybe means there’s a limit when it will stop working ? 2. Why the DNS generally ? What I “maybe” understood it will make the app continue working even if the certificate was expired. I hear a lot of NOT disabling. 3. All certificates from Khoidvn show a expiry, when they expire, will Khoidvn upload new ? Or just a matter of time. 4. After expire of certificate will I still be able to use the apps ? ( OR in what case ) 5. Why the apps getting crashed sometimes and have to do everything from scratch? Maybe VPN ? I am sure something I AM DOING making them crash."}

LiveContainer basically works by swapping out the app code using the live container ID, which bypasses the 3 app limit, since iOS and Apple only see one app sideloaded, LiveContainer. A paid apple developer certificate is an upgrade to a personal one that does not have the 3 app limit, the 10 apps per week limit, and an expiry time of 365 days. A signing service takes a relatively small fee from users, and gives them access to a paid certificate. This splits up the cost between several customers, reducing the financial burden. Since the 99$ per year accounts are meant to be personal accounts though, Apple will often figure it out (by seeing things like multiple people in completely different parts of the world using the same cert) and terminate the account. This immediately disables all apps using the certificate, forcing users to try to get a new cert from the signing service. It's not a great experience at all, which is what the user above was talking about"}

I don't know. Moe is gone. I've started something else, but its going to take a bit to get back in order. I still have keys to give away for RXTikTok as well. I'm sorry for the mess and I hope you don't let this ruin my name and reputation. The link for the new group is: [HERE]( Thank you for your patience. Give me a few days to get everything back in order. Hey everyone, We just launched Tweakers Lounge, a laid-back spot run by some of the same crew from ethmods; (**@moeotf**) and myself (**@yougottabillieve**). It’s a mix of tweaked iOS & Apple Watch apps, daily updates, and exclusive mods you won’t find anywhere else (multi TikTok, Insta, YouTube, X, etc). It’s not just apps. We’ve also got free bots (App Store monitor, TestFlight bot, deb extractor), IPA help, and a chill community where you can hang out, share memes, and chat with other sideloaders. We **don’t** sell certificates, but we’ve partnered with **KravaSign** and recommend them as a trusted signing service. Our apps are tested and updated daily on Krava certs, so you know they’re reliable. If you’re looking for a place that’s fun but still keeps you updated with the latest tools, this is it."}

They may be more expensive than others, but as I said, no drama or sketchy telegram or discord channels, where you need to purchase certs, which you then need to provide separately in some web form to install your apps. It's basically a complete solution for a bit of a premium ($20 a year). Definitely worth it for me."}

We would like to take this opportunity to provide some clarity and address these concerns directly. Appdb has been operating for more than 13 years as the largest independent app store, built on the principles of security, privacy, and reliability. Throughout this time, we have had zero incidents of user information leaks. Past security challenges have further demonstrated that our architecture and practices are aligned with industry best standards—something that millions of our users can attest to. For many years, appdb relied on the Mobile Device Management (MDM) framework to securely deliver applications to devices. Unfortunately, Apple has since placed this technology behind a vendor-only wall ([more details here]( making it inaccessible for platforms like ours. The MDM framework not only enhanced security and privacy but also enabled valuable features, such as [app installation history]( advanced compatibility checks, [custom installation options]( and support for [official app distribution]( with full functionality (including push notifications, attestation, and in-app purchases). Since our [transition away from MDM]( in part by Apple’s restrictive policies that limit interoperability ([see here]( have implemented an encrypted profile delivery system. This ensures that device configurations remain consistent, safe, and secure. However, the absence of MDM prevents us from retrieving certain device information, such as iOS version and installation status, through system frameworks. To maintain feature parity for our users, we instead use a lightweight dylib at the app level. Its sole purpose is to confirm whether an app is installed and to report the iOS version—both in an anonymized way. We are fully committed to transparency. To address the concerns of security researchers *that do not recommend us anymore* and community members, we have open-sourced the dylib code, which you can review [here]( We also invite you to explore our broader [open-source repositories]( which include app examples, including all supported appdb features, and build tools designed to make app distribution on appdb easier than ever. *P.S. For clarity, we also add an installation UUID and binary tag into Info.plist as part of the process.*"}

But at the same time, I was not happy to find that the IPAs I signed contained a dylib I did NOT inject, dbservices.dylib Furthermore, after checking the network traffic of my app, I found this: This is sent every time I open the app, with information like an identifier and my complete iOS version. I call upon u/appdb_official to ask for our consent before doing this, you have to understand, even if your intentions are good — And I do think there are legitimate reasons to send this — doing stuff like this without asking erodes the trust you have as a platform."}

I only need 3 of the stock tabs anyways (start, subs, library) a download tab would be perfect. Also the ability to change the tab order would be a nice extra 3. PiP and Background playback (and isponsorblock) don\u2018t work for downloaded videos Maybe these things only bother me, but in my opinion these changes would make the tweak perfect and much better than cercube. But I also have something positive to say: I really like the gestures, especially for brightness EDIT: Ah, yeah, did you forget to add YTClassicVideoQuality or is there some kind of incompatibility?

This tutorial will walk you through the process of sideloading apps on your iPhone using SideStore with the Live Container method. By the end, you'll be able to run sideloaded apps like Enmity Discord and YTPlus, as well as music apps like EveeSpotify or YTMusicUltimate. The best part is that you don't have to rely on any DNS to block Apple servers, so you can reboot your phone without worrying about revokes. You can now use that empty DNS slot to install any AdBlock DNS, such as AdGuard, to block ads for a better experience. With SideStore, you will not need an internet connection for six days after sideloading with SideStore. Note that the app will expire on the seventh day at the same hour you first refreshed it, unless you perform a refresh before then. Most importantly, after you have SideStore installed, you won't need to use a PC again since you can refresh apps on the device itself thanks to StosVPN. You can automate this process with shortcuts too! With this method, certificate revokes and blacklisting are no longer going to be a problem. **This guide is aimed at those with a free Apple ID account who want to bypass the three-app limit using Live Container!** **You can only use one free Apple account in SideStore to sideload for one device; use a different account for another device.** Read this guide carefully if you want one of the best sideloading solutions! # What is Live Container, and why is it special? Live Container is a special app that uses virtualization technology to run other apps inside it. Think of it as a \u201cmagic box\u201d that can hold and run many apps while only counting as one app toward your sideloading limit. This is why it's so powerful: * Normally, **a free Apple ID** only lets you install 3 sideloaded apps total and expires every week! **A paid Apple Developer Account** ($100 annually) allows you to sideload an unlimited number of apps on your devices with special entitlements that expire every year. A paid account defeats the purpose of using Live Container, so if you have the money, go for the paid developer account and use SideStore to sideload apps with it; otherwise, if you have a free account, then use SideStore and sideload Live Container. * Live Container uses virtualization to create a separate environment inside itself where it can run other apps. * You can install dozens of apps inside Live Container (YT+, Apollo, Enmity, EveesSpotify, etc.) while it only counts as ONE app toward your limit. Your iPhone storage is the ultimate limit on how many apps you can install. * Because of how virtualization works, you can only use one app inside Live Container at a time. You will need to close the app to use another one. Unfortunately, notifications do not work (go to the bottom of this guide for tips to alleviate it!). * The apps inside Live Container don't need to be signed or refreshed individually. Refreshing Live Container from SideStore is all you need to do since its all contained in a single app. * **\\[New as of May/13/2025\\]** An experimental multitasking feature was added that feels like Apple's Stage Manager. **Note: If you install two Live Containers (which takes up 2 of your 3 app slots), you can run two different virtualized apps simultaneously, like one in each container.** # Prerequisites Before starting, make sure you have: * A PC running Windows 10 or later. * You can do this on macOS as well just by viewing instructions for \"**Mac**\" and downloading the files from [SideStore.io]( The process shown in this guide will be similar. * An Apple ID * An iPhone with iOS 16 or later (this is because StosVPN needs IOS 16 minimum). * You can do this on iPad as well (minimum iPadOS 16 for StosVPN), so if using iPad, ignore where it says iPhone and think of it as iPad. This guide was aimed at iPhones since I do not have an iPad. * You can install SideStore on iOS 14/15, but you will need a PC to refresh, as StosVPN is not available for older versions. It's better for you to use TrollStore: [ * Stable internet connection * A genuine charging cable to connect your iPhone to your PC. Only needed for initial installation! * **Important**: Non-Microsoft Store versions of iTunes and iCloud installed on your PC * iTunes: [ * iCloud: [ * If you have Apple Music or the Apple Device Windows app, uninstall them first, otherwise your device will never show up in iTunes. * Use Apple Software Update app via windows search bar to update your iTunes to latest version in case you get an error. * Developer mode enabled (if on iOS 16+). You navigate to Settings > Privacy & Security > Developer Mode and toggle the switch to the on position. If it\u2019s your first time sideloading, it\u2019s hidden until you install an app, so keep this in mind. It should appear after you install SideStore. # Step 1: Download Required Tools **Download these files to your computer and extract all the zip files:** 1. AltServer.zip:[ Download from SideStore.io]( 2. SideStore.ipa:[ Download from SideStore.io]( 3. jitterbugpair-win64.zip:[ ]( from SideStore.io]( **Note:** These links might change in the future. You can download from [ and view their instructions as well. Their Github Repo is also useful: [ **On your iPhone:** 1. Have the StosVPN app installed from the App Store on your iPhone. It was developed by the SideStore team to replace WireGuard (no longer supported), for reliability. 2. Download the Live Container IPA from[ GitHub]( 3. Install StikDebug from the App Store for enabling JIT (optional, useful for emulators or JIT-required apps, covered at the bottom of this tutorial as a bonus step). I recommend having all these iPhone apps in a single folder to keep it organized and easy to find. [Organized folder. LiveContainer and LiveContainer2 installed later in step 6 and 9.]( # Step 2: Install AltServer on PC 1. If you haven't already, extract the AltServer zip file. 2. Run setup.exe to install AltServer. # Step 3: Install SideStore on Your iPhone 1. Connect your iPhone to your PC with a charging cable. 2. Make sure your device is recognized (should appear in iTunes). 3. Open AltServer (check system tray in taskbar for the icon). 4. Hold SHIFT key while clicking on the AltServer icon. 5. Select \"**Sideload .ipa**,\" and you should see your iPhone name popup on the side, which you click. 6. Browse and select the SideStore.ipa file you downloaded. 7. Enter your Apple ID and password when prompted. 8. Wait for installation to complete on your iPhone. [AltServer appears in the Windows system tray with an option to \\\\\"Sideload .ipa\\\\\" to your device.]( # Step 4: Create a Pairing File 1. Make sure your phone is unlocked while connected to your iPhone via cable. 2. Open JitterbugPair.exe on your PC. A \u201c**Trust This Computer**\u201d popup will appear on your iPhone, so tap \u201cTrust\u201d and enter your passcode. 3. JitterbugPair will create a new pairing file in the same directory as the program. 4. Transfer this pairing file to your iPhone via email, Google Drive, Intel Unison etc. This will get saved to your files app. [Pairing file that needs to be transferred to your device!]( **Note: You might need to do this all over again if you update your iOS version. Please don't share this with everyone since it contains your UDID (Unique Device Identifier), where anyone with access to this identifier could potentially use it to target your specific device.** # Step 5: Set Up SideStore [StosVPN configured and enabled!]( 1. On your iPhone, go to Settings > General > VPN & Device Management. 2. Trust your developer certificate/Apple ID. 3. Then go into StosVPN app and have it added as a device VPN and turn it on (this is crucial for on-device refreshing). 4. Open SideStore. 5. When prompted, select the pairing file you transferred. 6. Sign in with your Apple ID in SideStore settings. 7. Refresh all your apps to check if everything works so far. 8. You can disconnect from your PC. You won't need it again unless you want to update SideStore or need a new pairing file. 9. Make sure you refresh your apps so they don't expire every 7 days. Keep notifications on so you know. [App Expiration Example.]( **Note:** If you forget to refresh, SideStore and all its apps will expire and show a message saying they're \u201cno longer available.\u201d Don\u2019t worry, and definitely don\u2019t delete your apps (you\u2019ll lose your data). They haven\u2019t been revoked or blacklisted. Just connect to a PC, open AltServer, click the \"Sideload .ipa\" option, and select the SideStore.ipa file again to reinstall. After that, you should be good to go. You can go back to refreshing on-device using StosVPN like you normally do. You don\u2019t need to redo the whole tutorial. Just refresh all your apps in the SideStore app, and next time, make sure to refresh on time to avoid expiration. You can even automate it using the Shortcuts setup in step 11. # Step 6: Install Live Container 1. If you haven't already, download the Live Container IPA from[ GitHub]( on your iPhone browser. It will typically get saved in your downloads folder in Files app. 2. In SideStore, go to the \"**My Apps**\" tab. 3. Tap the \"**+**\" button at the top right. 4. Select the downloaded IPA to install it through SideStore. Wait for it to finish installing. It might get stuck, so you might have to spam install the app or reopen SideStore or reconnect the StosVPN. [LiveContainer installed. LiveContainer2 installed with step 9 \\(optional\\).]( # Step 7: Set Up Live Container in JIT-Less Mode # Method 1 (For SideStore 0.6.2-20250420.25+) 1. Open Settings in LiveContainer. 2. Tap \"**Import Certificate from SideStore**.\" 3. When SideStore opens with an export prompt, tap \"**Export**.\" 4. Go back to LiveContainer. 5. Tap \"**JIT-Less Mode Diagnose**\" then \"**Test JIT-Less Mode**.\" 6. If you see \"JIT-Less Mode Test Passed,\" you're good to go! # Method 2 (For SideStore 0.6.1 & older) 1. Open Settings in LiveContainer 2. Tap \"**Patch SideStore/AltStore**\" 3. The app will switch to SideStore to reinstall with the tweak. 4. If you use AltWidget, select \"**Keep Extension**.\" 5. Wait for installation to finish, then reopen SideStore. 6. Return to LiveContainer and press \"**Test JIT-Less Mode**.\" 7. If it says \"Test Passed,\" JIT-less mode is ready. [Successfully completed using Method 2.]( # Step 8: Install Your Sideloaded Apps Within LiveContainer 1. In Live Container app, look at the top left, above \u201cMy Apps.\u201d 2. Tap the \"**+**\" button. 3. Either click install IPA file or install from URL, whichever you have. But in my case I chose file. 4. Find and select your desired IPA files (YTPlus, EveesSpotify, etc.). Won't link it but you can find them with a simple google search. You can also download from your phone browser like from CyPwn's or DriftyWind's repo. 5. Wait for it to be added and then run your app. 6. Enjoy! **Quick Tip: If you want to open another app, you have to close Live Container from the app switcher and reopen it. If you did steps 9 and 10, launch whatever app you designated as an App Clip/Shortcut, e.g., YTPlus, and then Live Container will give you a prompt to replace the current app or open it in the second live container. It is more convenient!** # Step 9: Set Up a Second Live Container (Optional, but very useful!) This allows you to run two different apps simultaneously: 1. Open LiveContainer. 2. Go to Settings. 3. Tap \"**Install Another LiveContainer**.\" 4. Then save that LiveContainer2 IPA file and go back to Sidestore and install it. The first LiveContainer has a blue icon, the second has a gray icon. 5. To use an app in the second container: * Open the first LiveContainer (blue). * Long press on your app. * Open app settings. * Select \"**Convert to Shared App**.\" * Now you can launch this app using LiveContainer2 (gray). Close and re-open LiveContainer2 to see the changes. * For example, you can have the first container be Enmity Discord and the second container be Eveespotify. Great for having two different apps run at the same time. [LiveContainer2 with Shared Apps. Perfect for multitasking, allowing you to use another app alongside the one in your main LiveContainer.]( # Step 10: Add App to Home Screen (Recommended) [LiveContainer options for adding an app to your home screen.]( # Option 1 (Using Apple Shortcuts with launch URL. Best and most intuitive experience for app switching!) For easier and more intuitive home screen access to your sideloaded apps: 1. Open LiveContainer. 2. Long press on your installed app. 3. Tap **Add to Home Screen**. 4. Tap \"**Save App Icon**\" and then save it wherever in your files app. If you have a custom app icon saved already, then you can use that instead. Again in LiveContainer, long-press the installed app and tap \"**Add to Home Screen.**\" 5. Tap \"**Copy Launch URL**.\" This will copy the URL so you can use Apple Shortcuts to create an app shortcut on your home screen to launch the app, which makes it easier to multitask and switch apps by swiping left or right on the home bar (non-home button devices) or swiping from the edges of the screen (home button devices). 6. Open the Shortcuts app, and in the Shortcuts tab, tap the **+** button in the top right corner. 7. Name the shortcut to whatever app it is, e.g., YouTube. 8. Tap \"**Add Action**\" and add \"**Open URLs.**\" 9. Now that that action is placed, paste it where it says \"**URL**.\" For my YouTube example, this will open it in the primary live container; it will look like: Open livecontainer://livecontainer-launch?bundle-name=[com.google.ios.youtube.app]( 10. If you want to open it in the second live container instead, edit the URL like this: livecontainer2://livecontainer-launch?bundle-name=[com.google.ios.youtube.app]( 11. To test if the shortcut works, tap the **Play** icon on the bottom right corner and allow any permission that pops up. If it works, then great! Go back to the shortcut app and press the **Share** button that was next to the Play icon and tap \"**Add to Home Screen**.\" 12. Tap the photo option, then tap \"**Choose file**\" and select the app icon you saved earlier. You can choose other options if you have a custom icon stored somewhere. Lastly, on the top right, tap \"**Add**,\" and it should show up on your home screen. [Shortcut to launch YouTube in LiveContainer2.]( Special thanks to u/Specific_Peanut8359 for bringing this up. # Option 2 (Using App Clips for app switching. Simpler to setup, but option 1 is way better.) I don't recommend using this option since the multitasking feels wonky and there is less customization to it. I have shown the steps still for those that are curious and for transparency. For home screen access to your sideloaded apps: 1. Open LiveContainer. 2. Long press on your installed app. 3. Tap \"**Add to Home Screen**.\" 4. Choose \"**Create App Clip**.**\"** This installs an App Clip MDM profile that adds the app to your home screen. 5. Make sure to trust the App Clip profiles in Settings > General > VPN & Device Management. Unfortunately, you can't change the App Icon with App Clips. Use Option 2 with Shortcuts if you want custom icons. # Step 11: Set Up Automatic Refreshing (Recommended as it greatly reduces the burden of manually refreshing in SideStore every week) Create an Apple Shortcuts automation to refresh your apps when you sleep: 1. Open the Shortcuts app and create this shortcut with the title **SideStore Auto Refresh**: * Optional: Check if WiFi is connected (if not, create a notification saying, \u201dSideStore Refresh failed: No WiFi Connected!\u201d). * Connect to StosVPN. * Wait 3 seconds. * Refresh SideStore apps (the Sidestore action automatically proceeds after everything is done). * Disconnect from StosVPN. 2. Test the shortcut by running it manually and checking if it refreshed in the SideStore app. 3. Go to the Automation tab in the Shortcuts app. 4. Create a new automation to run at specific times (e.g., 3 AM daily or weekly). Select the \"**SideStore Auto Refresh**\" shortcut and have it run immediately without notifying you so it doesn\u2019t create a disruption. 5. SideStore should now automatically refresh in the background based on your shortcut automation! [Basic shortcut sequence for automatically refreshing SideStore apps.]( To make this easier, you can use my shortcut template. Just make sure to change the VPN variable to StosVPN (sometimes you need to reselect it if it doesn't work). You also might need to re-add the \"Refresh All Apps\" action if you get an error of it being unavailable. The shortcut should work fine, but feel free to tweak it so it works reliably for your device. **SideStore Auto Refresh Shortcut**: [ [I set up automation to auto-refresh apps at 3 AM, three times a week while I\u2019m asleep. No need to follow mine exactly, make it work for you.]( # Bonus Step: Setting Up JIT For Apps (Using StikDebug) In this example I am using PojavLauncher, but you can use it for any app that needs JIT. * In the LiveContainer app (make sure to close it and reopen it so it shows your app list). In the settings tab, set your JIT Enabler to \"**StikJIT (StandAlone)**.\" * Go back to the Apps tab, look for, e.g., PojavLauncher in the app list, then hold it, then tap \"**Settings**.\" * In settings, turn on \"**Launch with JIT.**\" For PojavLauncher, you need JIT, so get the StikDebug app from the App Store (or open it if you already have it installed). * Link your pairing file generated from your PC when you were installing SideStore, then have the VPN config setting set up when prompted. * Tap \"**Connect**\" and tap \"**LiveContainer**.\" * The StikDebug VPN should be connected, and LiveContainer should open, and from there you can run your app with JIT. # Tips and Troubleshooting * Always keep StosVPN on when refreshing or installing apps. Turn it off after you do that to save battery. You won\u2019t need to worry about this after using shortcut automation in step 11! * Your free Apple ID allows for 3 sideloaded apps maximum (SideStore + 2 additional apps or SideStore + LiveContainer + second LiveContainer). * If your device doesn't appear in iTunes, check that you've uninstalled Microsoft Store versions of iTunes/iCloud. Reinstall with the non-microsoft store versions and update them to the latest with Apple Software Updater. * If you update SideStore, you'll need to re-apply the Live Container patch. * If you are having trouble refreshing with the VPN on, then reset the pairing file in settings and repeat step 4 by generating a new one. * If SideStore gets stuck loading, sometimes you might need to spam the SideStore refresh button for it to work. * You might need a new pairing file if you update your IOS version. Reset pairing file in SideStore app settings and repeat step 4. * Notifications unfortunately do not work within Live Container due to limitations. Local downloads, like saving to files or photos, work well, though. If notifications are a must-have, then instead of having a second live container, you can install that specific app, e.g., modded Reddit with the SideStore app, which will take up your third slot. You can also alleviate the problem by having the original App Store app installed with the notifications on and hiding it on the home screen; that way, you are aware of notifications before you enter the modded version of the app. * To open links, e.g., YouTube, in LiveContainer, use this shortcut in the share tab of that specific page: [ * To install new versions of SideStore, just reinstall over the old one similarly to step 3; you won't lose data. To get new versions, you can look at SideStore's GitHub: * It's good to reboot your phone often, especially with how buggy iOS has gotten in these recent years. A simple reboot often fixes problems you might face. Don't worry, your apps will be fine! # Now you can enjoy your sideloaded apps with less worry than traditional sideloading methods!"}

There's a couple of glitches that happen. 1. When connected to VPN, SideStore after a few seconds fully shuts down even after updating the pairing file and logging in to the throwaway Apple ID again. When not connected, it behaves fine and I can't install or do anything without the VPN. 2. This bug is small but still annoying. The BETA orange logo turns into weird shades of pink, sometimes one pixel of pink, other times the whole logo is just a pink color. 3. The shortcuts provided don't work. The one that refreshes all apps gives an error, same with refreshing SideStore shortcut. Tried many solutions (reinstalling shortcuts, reviewing bug threads on GitHub, nothing...) I tried using WireGuard VPN, reinstalling and in general, troubleshooting the issue. Nothing came out of it."}

I recently switched to this method, and I find it more reliable and more private, especially because I don\u2019t have to rely on a DNS all the time just so I can use an app with an expired certificate, which inevitably will get revoked. You don't have to worry about any apps getting revoked. You can reboot your phone with no problem, but you have to pay attention to app expiry, which should not be a problem as long as you refresh your apps before 7 days on your free Apple Dev account (I automated mine with shortcuts to do that in the background). If you're curious, let's say you do forget to refresh it on-device; then when it expires, it will just say the app is no longer available, which is no big deal since you can just reconnect it to your PC and refresh it from there. Though the live container might take some getting used to because you can't launch every single app simultaneously because they are all within a single (or double) live container app that is designed to bypass the 3-app limit through virtualization. If you are switching between YouTube and Spotify, it should be no problem with two live containers."}

After going back into the Shortcuts app, then to the \"Sidestore Refresh\" shortcut, delete the SideStore action \"Refresh all Apps\" and re-add it.

Yeah, manual refreshing works normally. (I sideload apps from time to time for testing, so I understand how \"refreshing apps\" works). As in my screenshot, the \"unsupported\" message is right in original description of the available action that SideStore suggests to the Shortcuts app, so re-adding the action doesn't work. FYI, my setups are these: - iPad: wife's Apple ID for managing device, logging in Settings, iCloud etc.; while a burner Apple ID (created via music.apple site) only for stuffs related to SideStore. -> got this error - iPhone: wife's Apple ID for everything. -> the shortcut works like a charm. I got a strong feeling that the error on the iPad is due to using different Apple IDs, i.e. the shortcut is run under the main Apple ID permissions/authentication, while SideStore is integrated/assigned the burner Apple ID, so by default design/ restriction Sidestore doesn't/can't show its function to a different Apple ID. If so, maybe the devs can make some workaround?! Anyway, it took quite some efforts of me to setup and made SideStore work on these two devices (obviously thanks to your guide!), so I may not reset to try the stable version 0.6.1 soon. But when I do, I'll update the situation."}

Your rom should now be added on your Apple Watch, and will be there every time you tap the link - Make sure to save in game AND in the emulator menu before exiting, or you will lose your progress - After further use I\u2019ve figured out that your rom will fail to load after closing a few times (saying the rom size image is too small or something) so all you have to do is re-add your rom from drop box on your watch, you won\u2019t have to log in to Dropbox again and your save will still be there even when you add the rom again! Then simply remove the old rom - Rinse and repeat the above bullet point every time your rom fails to load! Enjoy! EDIT: - I also recommend changing the text speed on Pok\u00e9mon to fast straight away, makes it much better! - Also to speed up the FPS - when in game, hitting menu, then setting the emulation speed to fast forward will make it run abit better. - Also worth note, unless you permanently download the rom to your library (which isn\u2019t possible on the watch, but is on your phone), you have to make sure your phone is on and in range with wifi connection so that your watch Eclipse can fetch the rom, you can then be away from your phone without wifi and continue playing and save as normal."}

GBA should be more interesting though, if anyone can experiment and let me know that\u2019d be great! I will probably end up trying myself at some point, just wondering if anyone would be willing to try now, please let me know if so! UPDATE: Tried a gba rom, Pok\u00e9mon Emerald in particular and it wouldn\u2019t work, I\u2019m guessing the watch isn\u2019t powerful enough for gba, or it could be a storage issue! On my Eclipse, it says I have 4.96 MiB available storage and Pok\u00e9mon yellow is only 0.01 MiB, whereas I think gba games may be too much if anyone can correct me on this? It can handle gb/gbc/NES no problem though. It also somehow messed up my Pok\u00e9mon yellow rom saying the disc Image file is too large or something? But when I re-uploaded the rom to Dropbox and re-added it to my eclipse library, it worked no problem and even kept my save! It\u2019s been all good since then, if you just want to play the games that work maybe avoid trying to add gba games as it may mess up like mine but your saves will remain, and you can just re add the rom like I did and everything will work as normal again."}

Even after I stopped contributing, a fellow collaborator kept the effort going for about a year. To the (now suspended) GitHub user Ariana Minaj, your hard work is very much appreciated. Also a huge shoutout to hieuddo for setting up the links for ESign, AltStore, etc, and the related GitHub actions/files. But, all good things must come to an end. **As of today, my GitHub account has been shadowbanned. Against my will, the library, as well as some of my other projects have been taken down.** While I still (technically) have access to my account, I have no permissions and none of my repos are public-facing anymore. Prior to this, GitHub support did their job of communicating their issues with the repo so I could adjust accordingly. This time it was without warning. I have already submitted an appeal for this, but even if it gets reinstated, neither I nor any of the repo's collaborators have the motivation to continue maintaining this project while GitHub takes down our work without communicating with me or other collaborators. With that being said, if you manage to catch the repo live again, it will be nothing more than an exhibit of an old idea. I did notice over 100 (now probably non-functional) forks of the repo. Maybe someone has an offline backup? What I'm saying is, if you have copies of your files, please keep them in a safe place **So, this is goodbye** I have had a lot of fun with this project. Even after I wasn't the main contributor, I still found the occasional joy answering the open issues. It made plenty of my days seeing this server being mentioned time and time again on the subreddit, along with the overwhelmingly positive reception this was getting over the years. **Update:** I just realized I have an old (last modified 30 May 2024) backup of the repo back when I was testing a script to update cloned GitHub repos. So, here is [TrollStore-IPAs]( No releases included, but that was the entire structure. Credits to hieuddo and Ariana Minaj for their share of the work on it"}

Goes to show how amazing the repo was and dependent we all were on it. It's a shame that it's now been taken down due to you being shadowbanned by GH, and the currently active maintainer Ariana being banned. I suppose at the end of the day it was a matter of time given the nature of distributing IPAs, but damn is it a shame something so beneficial to the sideloading community is now gone. I hope that you and Ariana can work together to get something else set up on another Git repository elsewhere so that GH doesn't shut you all down again, because the community definitely needs more people like you and Ariana. You both helped build and maintain an extensive repository for sideloading apps injected with tweaks for those of us not fortunate enough to jailbreak or who have chosen not to. Your repository was trusted by all and the *go-to* place for IPAs for many people such as myself. Thanks for everything you, Ariana, and the other maintainers or contributors have done for the sideloading community."}

As someone who isn\u2019t that active in the sideloading community, your work has been so helpful to me. I simply have a dev account and use some modded apps for fun, and never really had the time, effort, or knowledge to manually source my IPAs. I also constantly run the latest iOS version, with no intention to jailbreak or TrollStore, so having all of these modded, but non-jb dependent apps was a godsend. Truly appreciate all of the contributions you have made, and for all of the people you have benefitted - even people like me, who don\u2019t even jailbreak, and just want to get a little extra use out of the developer account I pay for. Where am I going to go now for trustworthy IPAs? Anyway, I do have a proposal. If anyone has an offline backup of the GitHub repository, with/without the releases, I am fully open to hosting it on my own web server and make a Git repository for this project. I am not sure how to maintain it, but I feel like at least a mirror would be great, and I\u2019ll do my best to get all the original links and IPAs. If anyone does have one, please let me know. It\u2019s really a shame. I guess all good things do always come to an end."}

I also saw the chance to move everything to a more friendly environment in GitHub instead of using Google Drive, which didn't allow a convenient way to reach out about issues nothing makes me happier than knowing that my vision for this IPA library became every bit of a reality for as long as it did: - brought less known app mods to the mainstream - maintained a longer list of apps without bloating the library with too many small/irrelevant apps - focused on utilities and social media over repetitive coin mods in games (Ariana eventually only focused on apps) - never quietly went off the grid - quality control and consistent uploads, thanks to Ariana's consistent efforts behind the scenes even though it'll only be a spec of a memory in the grand scheme of things, this was a lot of fun while it lasted"}

So in summary: - A server to store dylibs to make things easier on the end-user - Another idea is to either re-upload or re-use the dylibs available on GH so you don't have to host them yourself. Although, by redistributing it yourself you can come up with a filesystem that automatically shows available tweaks to inject into the IPA based on the supplied IPA - It would be nice to also have a feature for the user to manually upload their own dylibs - The website would allow users to upload their own decrypted IPA and choose from a list of dylibs to inject into the app all client-side assuming it's possible to do client-side"}

Of course, there's the easy solution of moving to another Git provider, but I suppose eventually it'll be taken down some day in the future too.

The solution is simply to replace the default API (in the Shortcut) that uses your own certificate where I use an expired one (Sunshine Insurance Group) but with a certain DNS Profile that sans the need for anything else all at one place. However, accessing your own API is one thing that most newbies overlook where my inbox (and the timeline here) is always filled with the same question again and again and again^(\u221e) # Link \u00bb [Full Tutorial]( \u21b3 This Tutorial here is an alternate method that uses Esign. **DESCRIPTION:** The essence is pretty much the same whether you use the Shortcut or Esign method but the Esign tutorial here simply compresses everything into the simplest form other than the explanation given as if am building a Shortcut again for average of Joe's here by limiting everything to a single tap (instant links) until I make my mind to also develop a Shortcut that automates the process of Esign installation step-by-step. Most of the resources to make this tutorial easy is because of Khoindvn so am adding nothing new here but instead of referencing multiple resources I am directly integrating what's instantly deployable as soon as possible like the original Esign install links which are down because of cert status but is up from Khoindvn's which uses single certificate (more on that in the tutorial) or Coco Cloud certificates which would require you've an account even though it's a free one widely available from Scarlet, FlekStore to Signed Installer. **AUTHOR NOTES:** I hope there're no questions left but instead of creating an account on the tutorial site, you can simply present them here in the comment section itself. However, I would still like to urge in taking some time whenever you're stuck instead of immediately resorting to one-on-one interaction. --- **NOTE:** Beware of the Pyramid Scheme Network from Telegram Channels trying to sabotage every free tutorial here for Paid Certificate Commissions which includes AppTesters to MapleSign. There's no such thing as Lifetime Certificate, they\u2019ll ask for your UDID which would change every time you Restore, Repair, Reset or Upgrade to a new device and that is the particular access which can give away your device information. **REMEMBER:** Using SCARE TACTICS is the typical behaviour of every scammer. Don\u2019t even trust the contribution here if it's new for you and it\u2019s fine because that is why I have attributed every single source along with an elaborate explanation to go through them yourself and is why **I urge you to read**. If this is the single most thing you fail to do, then I don't have any further time to waste on such individuals - and this is straight coming from me. --- **FOR SOME OF YOU - What kind of intelligent being would rather skip reading and directly jump to assistance?** Words have been bolded, sentences are in bullet-points, steps are with screenshots, hyperlinks are coloured and underlined, every instances are elaborated even when explained and not just mentioned, each section is still commented upon, entire resources of the internet are centred at one place, no paywall or anything to read from start to finish as many times as you want\u2026 and I don\u2019t really understand why on Earth is your first instinct to do anything other than finish reading that's laid out right in front of you and take a couple of moments to digest everything instead of needing to be assisted like Dora the Explorer? --- **[Copy/Paste]( to share within r/Sideloaded community:** ``` ``` --- ###Announcements: - [UPDATE(s) for Esign Sideloaders - Good News!]( - [VPN Update for Esign Sideloaders with Bypass Revoke]("}

Since it can access your searches n all Once again thnx for being so amazing:)"}

With the CF WARP 1.1.1.1 app, there are no issues with any site that I\u2019ve tried so far (I don\u2019t know how, but it\u2019s working). So, will this configuration work for eSign along with the VPN (WARP)? I would love to be able to say \u201ca VPN isn\u2019t necessary for me,\u201d but unfortunately, we do need it. Could you please explain if this would work or not? Ty for replying so many of us we appreciate it! Edit: Plus, does this configuration include the adblock lists? If it does, could you please make another configuration without the adblock filters? I\u2019m already using the AdGuard app, and those DNS filters are always causing problems for quite a lot of sites."}

About the DNS, the bypass revoke measure was actually already in the Shortcut and I have sourced as much as possible with all my investigative ability including the very GitHub repo which is linked in the beginning of the tutorial to go through oneself that will also lead one to author notes on how to replicate it themselves. If I were to explain, it would be from excerpts directly mentioned by him whether which service he relies on in the backend (CloudFlare) to why he chose them (reputation, infrastructure, **free**) but unlike a personal profile from NextDNS this is a public profile like Public VPN Servers already used by many (including myself) in several thousands to eek out one single person\u2019s searches.

The more complicated answer is to host your own dns as explained \\[here\\]( and change your vpn to use that custom dns instead (if your vpn allows to use custom dns). Is this correct?

One thing you may try is, go to DNS Settings for KhoinDNS to find the Server URL, that first word before CloudFlare is the Gateway DoH Subdomain to replace the `ciwelz9v7y` in your Warp app. Likewise, before you begin rest of the steps from the beginning\u2026 unselect the one that filter ads which in this case is \u201cAdware Filter \u2713 (DoH)\u201d to only run the Bypass Revoke filters. However, if you do the same while certs are installed and apps are verified then they get blacklisted because of the caveat mentioned above. So, just do everything in reverse like uninstall the apps before which you can logout if you were, then remove the cert before playing with DNS settings. You\u2019ll also have to remember that once you unselect one, anything else can be selected as secondary which is the actual reason he made two but actually not required because that can lead to DNS leaks again - just something to remember."}

I\u2019ll give a brief just for you: The certs are already revoked and the DNS Profile is a filter that blocks contacting certain Apple servers from knowing that the certs you\u2019re using are actually revoked. If\u2026 you tried to download Esign before installing the DNS Profile that we call Bypass Revoke then your device blacklists those revoked certs so it can\u2019t spoof again even if you install the DNS Profile again. Since, you\u2019ve already installed Esign\u2026 it means you\u2019re not blacklisted but if one cert doesn\u2019t work then simply try another. Usually, the cert that got your Esign installed ensures that cert will work for installing other apps but other certs can be imported as well. Below in the Guide there are also some settings mentioned for Esign in case it needs a different fix."}

Cydia Impactor has the handy step of allowing you to select a Team after providing AppleID credentials, which allows to me to select my Paid Developer, or (Agent) team. It seems AltStore might be grabbing the first team, or making an arbitrary decision. I'll bet people who were wise to use a new AppleID for their developer account aren't seeing any issue, as their paid Team is the only thing attached to their AppleID. I think I even mailed Apple Support to remove the \"free account\" portion from my AppleID and didn't get anywhere, but perhaps I didn't pursue it hard enough."}

This choice always could\u2019ve been implemented while keeping the original intent of security in place, Apple could\u2019ve just implemented some sort of hidden \u201cAdvance\u201d Mode that maybe you have to hook your device up to a desktop/laptop computer and go through several prompts to enable, it would warn you of the dangers of going into advance mode and then leave you to it once you confirm, this way people who don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing can\u2019t enable it directly from the phone and people who do know what they\u2019re doing can enable it from a desktop/laptop computer But instead apple chose to lock down the device entirely and not provide that option Also sideloading has been a thing for years in the form of configuration profiles but it\u2019s this whole hassle of getting and keeping apps signed It\u2019s funny how all the people complaining about this have no clue that it\u2019s technically been around for years, it\u2019s just been an unofficial workaround that\u2019s a pain in the ass to do. Also apps run sandboxed anyway, so a malicious app can hardly do anything to harm you unless it exploits your device like a jailbreaking tool would, and seeing how hard that is for people to intentionally do these days, I don\u2019t see someone accidentally installing something malicious that does it, especially if they are the type of person to keep their device updated Not to mention all the jailbreaks these days go away after a reboot With all this security in place it\u2019s very unlikely to get malware on iOS when your device is jailed and constantly updated."}

I know it might seem complicated at first, but I can assure you it's not at all. First you need to understand what it means to sideload apps on iPhone. Apple tries hard to get you to avoid downloading apps this way. When it opened the possibility of downloading apps from third-party stores a lot of users did so and this made Apple worried which introduced a limit of 3 apps downloaded outside the AppStore at the same time on an extra device every 7 days you would have to refresh apps to make them work (yes, very annoying). But fortunately there are many developers who have made stores that make you almost forget these limitations. You can install these store because you are basically pretending to be their developer. I personally used AltStore for years (get the guide to download it from the official site, it's pretty simple) and then switched to SideStore. Why did I switch to SideStore and why do I recommend it? First, it basically allows you to get around the 7-day limit imposed by Apple because with a method, which I will not explain here so as not to write too much, it allows you to do the refresh only with a VPN tunnel and a wi-fi network instead of connecting your phone to your computer every 7 days (read their very well done guide and above all do not put your main apple ID but create an ad hoc one as shown in the guide). Second you can add custom app sources, which at the time of writing is a feature reserved for AltStore supporters. As for how to download .ipa files from GitHub it sounds difficult but in reality it's a piece of cake just browse the page with a wee bit of patience, most developers allow you to download the file either among the project files or in the Releases section, others ask you to add their site to AltStore/SideStore but even then you just have to follow what they explain. I hope I was helpful, welcome to the world of sideloading!"}

You also don't have to worry about server space or anything. By the way, Spotify above also allows this. Only if you're downloading, it's only the whole album (you can't download individual tracks). Of course, they're not inseparable from each other, but still, you can't download each one separately. As later, you cannot delete each invidual, only the whole album. There is also [uYou Enhanced]( which allows downloading from YouTube (you can the music itself.)"}

Altstore (the free method) still works great though and hopefully that does not change anytime soon. UPDATE - 9/9/22: Appdb has officially announced that they no longer recommend people buy appdb pro but rather use their own developer account purchased directly from Apple, they state the reason is because Apple is making it harder for appdb to work properly, appdb seems to be fine for now for the most part but I don\u2019t believe they\u2019ll last forever unfortunately, Appdb still appears to be a good solution but Apple seems to be cracking down on more, between making it way less convenient and tagging on more and more caveats to the whole process, it\u2019s only a matter of time now unfortunately, for now though, this post should still be decently relevant but there\u2019s no doubt in my mind that things can change. So I\u2019ve been seeing a lot of posts lately from people new to sideloading on iPhones and I decided it was about time to make a guide, I\u2019ll go over what sideloading is and how you can do it yourself so let\u2019s begin PART 1: First of all, What\u2019s sideloading, is it a sex move?! Well first of all no and second of all\u2026 Sideloading is the process of installing programs onto a device through sources other than the ones that a device manufacturer gives you, In this case Apple tries to keep you installing apps exclusively from the App Store, However in this guide I\u2019ll go over how you (Yes you good sir!) Can get around such limitations Now Apple requires all apps to be digitally signed aka approved before running on your device, unlike android which lets you install anything, signed or unsigned We can either get the apps signed in our name for free with limitations or pass the signing onto someone else I\u2019ll be going over both of those options and what they mean shortly So there are a couple different ways to go about sideloading, One is slightly more official while the other involves hacking your iOS device otherwise known as jailbreaking, for the sake of simplicity I\u2019ll be going over how to do this process without jailbreaking, which would be the option much more beginner friendly anyway \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Part 2: Why would I want to sideload anyway?! Aren\u2019t all my favorite apps on the App Store anyway? (Except fortnite cough cough) Good question! So Apple has strict limitations and guidelines to what gets on the App Store, if a developer doesn\u2019t comply with these guidelines/rules they\u2019ll either be rejected from the App Store or get their app taken down later, and these restrictions effect you as the consumer by limiting what you can have on your device, for example things like dedicated NSFW apps aren\u2019t allowed, meaning you won\u2019t find any hentai apps on the App Store (unfortunately) Or other things like torrent clients and iffy streaming apps are absolutely banned on the App Store, Now anyone who wants to develop these apps can still do so, but they\u2019ll try and distribute their apps off the App Store This is where sideloading comes in, Sideloading Developers will even make things like modded versions of your apps that remove ads, add extra features and more, so for example you could sideload ad free YouTube and spotify to your device and enjoy those services ad free for free (THATS RIGHT I SAID FREE!!) \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 PART 3: Well where do I sign up?! So to get started sideloading without a jailbreak you have a couple of options The first one requires a computer but it completely free to do, Whereas the other will require you to fork over $20 a year We\u2019ll start with the free method but you should know it is a lot more hassle than the paid method (because nothing good in life comes for free, well if you take Adblockers and piracy out of the equation of course) So without further ado..the free method PART 4: The free method Requirements: a computer, and lightning to usb A Cable (aka your phone charger, if you exclusively do wireless charging and lost your original charger a cheap third party one will do just fine..not that I would know) And you\u2019ll need iTunes installed This method utilizes apple\u2019s development sideloading with a free developer account This method of sideloading takes advantage of tools designed for developers to test their apps before releasing them onto the App Store, with a free developer account you don\u2019t get push notifications and the apps will expire every 7 days (meaning every week they stop working until you give them new signatures) Also you can only have three apps on your phone at a time using this method and altstore is one of them so you can pretty much only have two real apps at a time To keep the apps fresh and non-expired we\u2019ll be using a piece of software called altserver and alt Store, this software automatically keeps the apps from expiring by wirelessly connecting to your iPhone from your computer to \u201cRefresh\u201d The apps I\u2019ll be using Windows 10 for this guide (but it\u2019s ok you probably didn\u2019t need this guide if you were using Linux anyway!) of course this will also probably work the same exact way on macOS too So the first step is to download and install a piece of software called altstore, found here Once you install it go to your start menu and run altserver, now plug your iPhone into your computer Next go down to the taskbar in the little menu of icons and right click the little alt server icon Now press \u201cInstall altserver\u201d Now it\u2019ll ask you for your iCloud credentials, don\u2019t worry this is not a scam (at least not that I know of lol) I\u2019d suggest using an alternate iCloud account for this (it has to be one that your signed into on your iPhone and you can have multiple accounts on your iPhone at once so it\u2019s not a big deal anyway) Once you do that, continue with the installation, you\u2019ll see a piece of software appear on your iPhone called \u201cAltstore\u201d Launch it and put the same iCloud details into the app Now you\u2019ll need to leave altserver running on your computer for it to work properly and sometimes it won\u2019t work properly in which case you\u2019ll just have to troubleshoot it unfortunately because the problems can vary on a number of factors Now you can go into altstore and sideload apps! Just press the plus button to sideload any IPA file \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 PART 5: The paid method Okay this method is a LOT easier and hardly has any disadvantages apart from the fact it\u2019s paid (but it is pretty cheap at $20 a year) We\u2019ll be using a service called Appdb This service allows you to install apps right from your device without a computer First go to the appdb website on safari Now press \u201cLink your device\u201d it\u2019ll ask you for an email, enter your email or an alt you have personal access to (not a temp email) and continue Next it\u2019ll try and download a configuration profile (configuration profiles are meant to be used by businesses and other organizations to manage company devices and apps but we use them here to install our own personal apps signed by appdb) Now go to your settings and install it, you can see all the permissions it needs before hand so you know it\u2019s safe Once the profile is installed you\u2019ll see an appdb icon on your Home Screen, this is a redirect to the website, tap on it and go back to appdb Now trying to install an app will prompt you to buy \u201cPro\u201d (the annual $20 service) alternatively the option is also in the drop down menu for your linked device Now just purchase pro and you can install any app from appdb (or any ipa) to your device! There\u2019s no limit to the apps you can have with appdb (at least not that I know of!) \u2014\u2014\u2014 Now your all set! Well sorta..now you just need apps! PART 6: So many apps what do I get?? Here are some personal favorites of mine: Better cercube (YouTube with no ads and a bunch of enhancements) Sposify (spotify with no ads and some enhancements) Itorrent (for when you need to sail the seven seas or just download from Nhentai or get Linux ISO\u2019s for whatever reason) \u2014\u2014- PART 7: The end of this journey into learning to sideload and the beginning of your own journey into the world of sideloading Well I hope this guide helped you, happy side loading!"}

As cool as altstore is, apples free developer account limitations render it a very limited side loading method If the total app limit and 7 day refresh didn\u2019t exist it would be a viable option but as it stands right now, your just better off paying a signing service or the $99 apple tax for a paid developer account Appdb is $20 a year and provides the same sideloading capabilities of a paid dev account whereas apples paid dev accounts cost $99 a year."}

So if you have a dev account, you can sideload things with sideloadly without limitations, it\u2019s an alternative to altstore and both rely on your Apple ID to function, using them with a free dev profile will simply sideload them with the mentioned limitations. As for tweaked/custom apps and bans, there\u2019s quite honestly no saying with this one, while it\u2019s possible for Apple to add some sort of telemetry function that try\u2019s to detect non-developer activity with developer accounts, they haven\u2019t done such a thing yet and it\u2019s unclear if they will in the future, in other words you should be safe for now and there hasn\u2019t been any reported bans from personal usage like this but it\u2019s something that could change anytime if apple wanted it to, I honestly doubt it will happen for a while, it\u2019s not crazy to believe they\u2019d start doing something like that in the next few years though or so. And lastly, The point of a burner account is to serve a couple of different purposes, first of all, to protect your password just in case anything did happen but the second reason is to de-associate your real account with sideloading activity JUST IN CASE apple does start cracking down on it, you can add a burner account simply by going to Settings>Mail>Accounts>Add new account and selecting iCloud is the provider, once signed in, the account should work for sideloading!

Glad to help! Appdb is still a thing luckily! The bad news is the people that run appdb seem to be losing hope in themselves and are trying to get people to opt for a regular Apple dev account for 99$ as opposed to their service, as far as UDID reg goes, I\u2019ve never heard about them so I can\u2019t really comment on their service. Getting an Apple dev account is pretty easy as of right now, all you have to do is go to apples [developer portal](developer.apple.com) and enroll, the only big barrier to entry is of course the 99$ annual fee they charge. I would suggest starting out with appdb because it\u2019s only $20 a year and it seems to be going strong still as of now, if something happens to appdb, that\u2019s when I\u2019d switch over to an official dev account, appdb has a low likelihood of going down for at least another year or even a few in my opinion and if it does, it would only be a $20 loss, as opposed to the $70 you\u2019d save if appdb turns out to be fine for another year (which it most likely will) I would say in terms of sideloading, ios is actually safer in terms of android, perhaps not as open and free with all the signing restrictions, but safer because ios takes more measures to prevent apps from doing anything malicious, you can be pretty confident when you sideload something that your probably not going to get an infected device because iOS is like an armed fortress and heavily restricts and sandboxes everything you install. Overall I\u2019d say getting into sideloading is pretty simple right now but the only con to sideloading on iOS vs android is the fact that it\u2019s intended for developers which means iOS puts up more barriers to doing it, and could eradicate sideloading any moment just because everything you run has to be actively approved by Apple, we\u2019re just cheating the system by pretending to be businesses and app developers."}

I just logged in to Pokemon Go with a Google account. Then went to login with Ingress and it already had my credentials. That's my concern.

I don't mean these to be annoying or just counter your statements, I'm just offering my concerns. Please let me know if I'm misinformed. 1) I'll have to look into AppDB more, I wouldn't think you can get the same kind of reviews. like \"This version of AngryBirds uploaded by TechnologicalFreedom has reviews specifically\". Although I guess my Android vetting includes XDA trusted devs. 2) Not sure how to do that with each version released. Do they have multiple people upload the same IPA often? 3) But if it's already built, it's harder to know if anything was added. If I was compiling myself sure. 4) For the app itself or thr crack? Or do you mean your PC in general? 5) Yeah that's why I try to check signatures and GPG signs where applicable. 6) Yeah pretty sure you're talking about general OSes. On Android, I install in the Work Profile, and have NetGuard block it's traffic. Similar with Lulu on OSX(11). 7) Didn't read this before I mentioned it in #6. Still haven't found a good one on iOS. Lockdown didn't seem to do what I needed. 8) I don't do this but no reason not to."}

Which I saw has been an issue for quite a few of you guys using other IPA's. **If the IPA is failing to install, please let me know.** **If something doesn't seem to be working the way its supposed to, let me know and I'll see what I can do to get it functioning correctly.** Again, I'm sorry if this has already been updated and released on here, I just wanted to post mine here too just because I'm feelin' a little proud I was able to get it working :) &#x200B; ***Proof of it working***: [App On Home Page]( [First Time Opening App]( [Account Settings Page]( [Spotilife Settings]( &#x200B; ***Download***: [Mediafire]( [Dropbox]( &#x200B; THANKS GUYS, AND ENJOY! :) **If anyone has any requests for tweaked apps, let me know and I'd be super down to try and do more. Again, this was my first cracked tweaked app so I'm still really excited to learn more!** &#x200B; &#x200B; ***Edit:*** Download links updated. You shouldn't get any more errors about your device being unsupported anymore. This should fix the problem people were getting using signing services like Signulous as well. Just like before, please let me know if there are any problems with the IPA and I'll do my best to fix it."}

I got sick of apps expiring and paid $25 for a lifetime developer certificate from the below site/person. Beats the $99/year to get a developer certificate from Apple directly.

I\u2019ve been working with the AppValley owner for 3+ years now and I want to make sure the community is aware of what\u2019s going on and is safe when using AppValley. There are still many confused about this situation and I\u2019m here to try and clear it up. AppValley was started by a couple of people (partners) and everything was pretty normal. Only one twitter account, one service. One partner (Jason Wu) decided to be greedy and change some passwords to the twitter account, domain etc to try and essentially steal the company. This is where we are at today. The official AppValley had to get a new domain, new twitter etc and rely on the trust of users to keep them from being forgotten and help them build back up their huge following. This isn\u2019t where it ends though. A lawsuit has been filed and is in progress details here - . This lawsuit would allow the official AppValley to regain everything that was stolen and be back to the ONLY AppValley. The unofficial AppValley is also known to contain malware. This reddit thread on the official AppValley subreddit shows that a user was getting spam messages after using the unofficial AppValley. The users comments have been since deleted for an unknown reason. .You are encouraged to remove all apps and profiles associated with the imposing AppValley. Official links are below We need you to spread awareness about this terrible act and help the official AppValley regain the trust they deserve and bring down the imposters.

If you don't have premium, make sure you get the version with both Sposify *and* Spotilife. Spotilife is what gives premium features, Sposify is what gives a bunch of customization features **Edit 2**: If you\u2019re getting an integrity error after installing with a signing service (Signulous, AppDB, etc), install using the default bundle ID and remove Cydia Substrate plist before installing. Only some signing services support these features so if yours doesn\u2019t you\u2019ll have to use something else. &#x200B; **Hello to the wonderful people of the Sideloading community!** &#x200B; As you might have already seen, I just posted an updated version of the Spotify IPA with the latest version of Spotilife - and a lot of people were requesting a version with Sposify bundled in as well. Apparently Lyrics and Highest Quality Audio weren't working for some people, but this should fix that. Along with giving you plenty of further options to customize the overall look of the Spotify app. &#x200B; ***For those of you who don't know what Sposify for Spotify does (Neither did I tbh, until it was requested in the other thread), here's a little rundown of all the options accessible within the app***: **Home** * `Connect Access Button` * `Import Your Music` * `No Burger Menu Icon on Lockscreen` * `Verified Profile Badge` * `Voice Search` * `What's New Section` **Your Library** * `Artists & Playlists Old Interface` * `Create Playlist New Interface` * `Disable Add Songs Button` * `Disable Play Button` * `Disable Recommended Songs Section` * `Disable Swipeable Actions` * `Hide Create Playlist` * `No Shuffle on Big Play Button` * `Open Canvas Playlist` * `Show Album & Artist Recommendations` * `True Shuffle` * `View Artists Offline` **Now Playing View** * `Align Text to Top` * `Auto Hide Duration Labels` * `Blackout Mode` * `Canvas Choice Button` * `Canvas Tap` * `Car View` * `Disable Genius Lyrics` * `Disable Storylines` * `Disable Canvas` * `Disable Queue Screen Controls` * `Disable Social Listening Section` * `Realtime Lyrics Button (Feature currently only available in Canada, Indonesia)` * `Realtime Lyrics Card (Feature currently only available in Canada, Indonesia)` * `Long-Press on any Canvas to Save them` * `Show Statusbar` (***Please note***, I have not tested all these features, but the ones I have tried all seem to be working in an unjailbroken state. I **have not** tested mp3 imports, so if that doesn't work there's really nothing I can do as it's a limitation to the tweak it's self in a jailed state and won't work without RW access/Substrate. That goes for anything that uses Substrate anywhere else besides the actual Spotify app, so showing Lyrics on lockscreen for example won't be possible \\[AFAIK\\]) &#x200B; **Also a little side note**: I apologize for making two threads for this. I just thought since it was a completely different tweak bundled in the IPA it would be fitting it had it's own thread incase people only wanted the version with Spotilife - which I also linked down below. If this isn't allowed or just flat out annoying to the community please let me know and I'll figure out a way to get all my new updated IPA's out at once. I just find it easier to make two threads for something like this. &#x200B; ***Proof of the tweaks working (on an unjailbroken device)***: [Sposify Welcome]( [Spotilife Welcome]( [Sposify Settings]( [Spotilife Settings]( [Working Sposify Lyrics]( [Highest Quality Audio]( [Unlimited Skips]( &#x200B; ***Download Links:*** **(This will work on all iPhones that support iOS 13, so essentially anything above an iPhone 6s should work. Looking into iPod support as well but need some testers)** [Mediafire]( [Dropbox]( &#x200B; ***Only Sposify***: [Mediafire]( [Dropbox]( &#x200B; *(* ***If you didn't want Sposify as well and just wanted Spotilife, check out my other post*** [***here***]( ***which is just a modded Spotify IPA injected with the latest current version of Spotilife.*** *)* &#x200B; **Thanks guys! You made my first release so much fun I just wanted to do another! Also, if anyone has any update requests for tweaked IPA's let me know and I'll see what I can do. I'm lovin' it so far. Just glad I'm able to help a few people out :)** &#x200B; ***STAY SAFE EVERYONE, AND HAVE A FANTASTIC DAY!*** &#x200B; Until next time **<3**"}

Supporting Legacy and 2.0 repo structures\\* * Import your own \\`.ipa\\`'s. * Inject tweaks when signing apps. * Install applications straight to your device seemlessly over the air. * Allows multiple certificate imports for easy switching. * Configurable signing options. (name, bundleid, version, other plist options)\\* * Meant to be used with Apple Accounts that are apart of \\`ADP\\` (Apple Developer Program). however other certificates can also work! * Easy resigning\\*\\*! If you have another certificate you would like to use on an app you may resign and reinstall that same app! * No tracking, analytics, or any of the sort. Your information such as udid and certificates will never leave the device. # Github ["}

Looks really promising since it's open-sourced and most importantly no tracking logs!! I do have some suggestions. When adding repos and looking at the apps(for example swaggy repo) they don't have any descriptions like on Esign as it doesn't show the app versions or tweaks injected in the apps so hopefully that's fixed/included in another update. Starfiles repo doesn't work BTW, idk if it's the app that's refusing it or Starfiles having to update their link to be able to add it into Feather. Also when signing the apps I have couple certificates. When you are in the customization menu trying to sign the app you can't choose the certificate you want to sign it with and have to do it through settings to the desired certificate. So it would be a QOL update to select certificate in the customization menu when signing. Also another QOL update would be automatic installing after signing."}

For the rest of us folks that don't live in the EU, Apple can still continue to screw us over. So why wouldn't they? > And people will continue to figure out ways to sideload regardless of Apple allowing it. That\u2019s my point. They might as well figure out a way to allow users to do it if they want because they\u2019ll do it anyway. The thing is, they don't want to make it easy, as that would make sideloading from being something really niche to being something that everyone and their dog does. Ofcourse making sideloading a more streamlined experience for every user would be great for consumers, but Apple does not have consumers' best interests in mind. They want it to be hard, painful and cumbersome, so that the vast majority of people wouldn't even bother with it. And, obviously, if they're not required to make it easier outside of EU, they wouldn't do that. Although i'm still on copium that there is at least some trace of decency left in Apple and they will bring this change globally, as these restrictions are pure anti-consumer BS, and, even more worryingly for me personally, Apple's monopoly on software distribution combined with political factors negatively affect the iOS dev job market in my country. Fingers crossed that they will do something decent for once, but, sadly, not counting on it."}

Besides, there is a push for app sideloading that's coming from the other direction - not from users, but from developers. I think, it's what Apple fears way more than the backlash from their user base. Just imagine, for example, if you are a famous developer of a renowned game or whatever, and you're able to bypass the AppStore and its ridiculous 30% cut by making your users sideload your app/game. What reason would you have to even put your app in the AppStore? As a dev, you'd lose out on a lot of money, just because most people, as you've pointed out, would prefer to download apps through AppStore if that option is available. But by forcing your user base to sideload your app, you'd keep the whole 100% of the profits to yourself. If the AppStore cut stays as it is and sideloading would be globally allowed, this is probably going to result in mass developer exodus from the AppStore, which will make it kinda barren as it is on macOS. Which, in turn, will only popularize sideloading even more, as sometimes as a consumer you won't even have a choice but to sideload, and you will get accustomed to it. So, Apple in this case has two options. Either stop being greedy and lower their cut to something more reasonable like 10% so that the traffic from the AppStore would be worth the slight loss of direct profit for the devs, or cling to their old way for as long as possible and continue to milk app developers outside of EU, while probably trying to lobby some anti-consumer laws in the US so that this golden cow could be milked forever."}

EDIT: The private jailbreak is for iOS 16.1.1, and requires advanced knowledge to understand."}

I have a paid developer account, normally use iOS App Signer on Mac and then use something like installonair to allow me to download the IPAs OTA. It's not the best solution but means I can get apps to people who are not at home and not able to connect an iOS device to a machine with Xcode. I do have remote access to my Mac to be able to do the signing but I guess something like this could make it so much easier. Before I knew about installonair, this is just the sort of thing I was looking for. I was looking for a way of being able to host from my own server and download the IPAs that had been signed OTA. I read about using something like Dropbox links in a webpage, didn't work and never really thought it woul since I read up more on Apple's requirements around OTA downloading of IPAs. I read that it must be hosted on HTTPS webserver, it must also have a signed certificate, not self-signed certificate either. Then some manifest file should be available besides the IPA itself. Note, I'm no expert with this, so please correct me if I am wrong. I currently have my Mac and a Windows 10 VM inside of the Mac so both inside the same network. Any suggestions on webserver I should use for HTTPS? I must use 443 or could I specify alternate port? I think 443 is available for me to use again now since I lost a server using that port recently. I think I need some easy enough to follow instructions and would sure give this a go."}

Apps are uploaded from and installed straight to your device. * Completely free and open-source. There are no features locked behind paywalls. There's no ambiguity in how the program works and what information it's using. If you don't like or are missing a feature, you are more than welcome to raise an issue or submit a pull request. * Self-hosted. Independent of signing providers that come and go, enterprise certificates which often get revoked, and in general, the shady grounds that all of those operate on. You can be certain that the service will be there and working exactly when you you need it. Most importantly, you can be certain that nobody is abusing your phone, UDID, uploaded apps, or any other information that you share with the service. * Works with any, and multiple, signing profiles. Sign for all of your devices from a single website. Since you bring your own certificate, you are not restricted just to this service. Mix and match with other signing tools as you please. * Actually works. Well, maybe other tools and services do as well, but from my experience a lot of them have signing problems. For an example, many don't properly expand wildcard certificates, resulting in broken entitlements in iOS 14, and in result, signed apps that can't import any file from the Files app. Additionally, with ios-signer-service you can configure some very useful properties of the signed app, such as allowing it to run on any iOS version, or enabling/disabling app debugging, necessary for e.g. emulators."}

Imagine if spotify told all its ios users that they either install the app from the spotify website, or they can't use it on ios.

My name is Colin, and I run[ AppValley]( This post is spoken from me on behalf of AppValley and TweakBox. Recently we've seen some false and defamatory claims about how my team and I run our service, and I want to personally get on reddit and post a rebuttal to [this tweet]( and [this reddit post]( First off, \u201cFennikami\u201d, the original poster of the false these statements, claimed our dynamic libraries, \u201cdylibs,\u201d were of malicious intent and asked for us to send our source code to prove otherwise. Not only will sending source code prove nothing (if we were malicious wouldn\u2019t we just change the code and send it to him?), it will allow him access to confidential information like keys and advertisement IDs. So from our standpoint giving out our source code could give him an even larger attack vector than he already has, and he doesn\u2019t seem to like us. It would be like Apple releasing the source code to all of iOS, there would be jailbreaks forever because of the insecure nature of sharing source code. Currently, his only attack vector is social media at this point, nothing I haven\u2019t dealt with before. Do you get what I\u2019m saying? Someone claims **x** and gets everyone all wild about something that is really **y**. To finish this claim of malicious dylibs, anyone with disassembler knowledge can take our dylib and look through it for any malicious activity or code. This can be done without us compromising our keys or advertisement IDs, something he hasn\u2019t done because he doesn\u2019t have access to a Mac. So, instead of verifying his baseless claims, he thinks he\u2019s excused because \u201che doesn\u2019t have a Mac.\u201d Secondly, and I believe lastly, there were questions about why we inject these dylibs into our apps. I had our social media manager reply as to the reason why we do such a thing. Which was, obviously, to pay the bills. It seems he did not want to hear this, and a lot of you don\u2019t know the true cost of bandwidth and users. We get (give or take) a petabyte or two a month of bandwidth. Let\u2019s do some math. That is **876** files being downloaded *every day*. Gigabits a second. Every day. All year. So how about a little math? Let's say that we only had 1Gbit/s of bandwidth every second for a month that is 334.8 terabytes. Assuming a $0.05 dollar amount on every gigabyte using AWS S3, that would be **334800 x .05** which equals **$16740**. A hefty fee for some files, right? So we make our money by adding advertisements to every app. Therefore we can keep AppValley free, and keep our servers up. I appreciate your time, thank you for listening. It is not up to me to change your mind or persuade you to one side or the other. I am only here to clarify. Thank you, Colin."}

I knew that was bullshit the second I saw it. I was not concerned or worried one bit. You cant go around releasing source to anyone like that just because someone makes a mostly arbitrary and very speculative claim like that.

To give every bozo who has some paranoid theory source so they dont go around defaming you is just insane. And honestly I found it EXTREMELY sketchy that we saw one post here about how signing services \"like app valley\" are not safe and it was shot down as baseless. And then the next day a DIFFERENT user posts trying to defame app valley with a stronger more thought out case. Im not convinced that is a coincidence...sounds to me like some people who dont like you or want something of yours were trying to put pressure on you, possibly to convince you to release source. But thats none of my business \\*sips tea\\* I have been so annoyed with all the hate and paranoia floating around this community regarding signing services and alternative app stores. People are just clueless about security and if you tell them something is unsafe they not only will believe you but they will run and tell everyone else like it's a fact even though they haven't even begun to grasp iOS security or any security for that matter as a concept."}

If something isn't working how it's supposed to let me know and I'll see what I can do to get it working. Also, Reddit No Ad's doesn't seem to be working at all. I've tried multiple versions but none want to load with the tweak and just crash at launch. Messenger No Ad's is likely the only app that's gonna be updated in the download list. Sorry about that :( ***Edit 1***: So, Messenger turned out to be a lot harder to decrypt than I thought it would be. Since Facebook wasn\u2019t too much of a hassle I thought I\u2019d be able to get Messenger working using the same method but I couldn\u2019t. I\u2019ve got a few more tricks I want to try, but I can\u2019t guarantee I\u2019ll be able to get it. As for Facebook No Ads, downloading videos seems to partially work. As long as you\u2019re downloading from the video feed it will work, downloading video stories seem to be broken for the time being. I\u2019m working on a fix for that. Same thing with TikTok God, video downloading seems to only partially work. There isn\u2019t a download button, so you need to tap and hold on the video to bring up the download menu. If this doesn\u2019t work, go to the users profile and download the video from their feed rather than inside the video. This shouldn\u2019t be necessary though. **These should all work with TrollStore as well!** &#x200B; # ENJOY!"}

It was kind of a challenge to understand everything at first, but now I can do it comfortably. But when some friends wanted to do sideloading too, and I saw they were struggling to understand the sideloading scene, I decided to develop a website that is simple and easy to understand for anyone to start sideloading. Instead of having a long document with everything in it, this website has different steps in different pages, having the information sparse, making it easier to focus on a step at a time. I developed this tool today, and I thought it would be a good idea to show share this resource in here, hoping it can be a good guide for beginners. The method showed in the guide is the Anti-revoke DNS method. I only have tried the website on two iPhones, but I believe it should work on most devices. Anyway, any feedback is really appreciated, as I want to make this tool even better and more polished."}

I can still use the app and I haven\u2019t run into any issues. And how do I update the app? btw I deleted the files from here and from the Library of Feather.

So there is a demand on getting decrypted and people want to build it on their own. Seeing so many requests on how to get decrypted IPA so user can build / inject tweaks to their favorite apps iOSGods released a new tool today which allows for easily decrypting and downloading the latest iOS IPAs! It's quite cool and very simple to use! 1. Visit 2. Log in to your iOSGods.com account from the top-right corner where it says \u201cAnonymous\u201d 3. Search for your favorite app. Example: YouTube 4. Click on \u201cDecrypt this app\u201d button and the app will begin processing. 5. Once it\u2019s done, you will now have the option to install via Sideloadly or simply download the decrypted .IPA file. I personally recommend installing via Sideloadly since then you can easily modify the IPA and inject Cercube or uYou+ into it and sideload! Example: Official iOSGods release topic: For the tweaks you can download your favorite on or you can use the [Windows Repo Tool]( which is similar like a jailbroken Package Manager for iOS to download the tweak **NOTE** This is a decrypting service so you can get the decrypted version of the app you want on the AppStore. This is not the place for modded, hacked app ** Happy Sideloading!"}

There are quite a lot of exceptions like it\u2019s 15% for small developers via Small Business Developer Program or 15% for each 2nd and next subscriptions of same user etc., but ok, let\u2019s agree that\u2019s details. Apple also make significant investments into maintaining App Store. New apps are reviewed manually before publishing to the AppStore under variety of scopes, there are new articles and interesting app(s) reviews every day, even in my native language. In some way my customers rights ARE limited - there is no zillion Calendar apps, half of them with malware included, to choose from - but I must say that I am very please by such a violation. I guess, malware developers may be less satisfied as they now are not able to reach their \u201ecustomers\u201c. All of the above makes using AppStore a far better, pleasant and secure experience for me than that using that one big mess called Google Play. But hey, forget about the operational costs, either. Okay, let\u2019s say they scrooges\u2026 But can you explain to me in what way does it limit my customer rights!? I have a great choice of devices and technologies, couple of operating systems to choose (many flavors of Android, KaiOS, Tizen, multiple indie initiatives like Ubuntu Touch, SailfishOS etc. + there were more in the past like WinMobile or Blackberry but they didn\u2019t make it throughout the years). Tere are even multiple ways to access almost any service around the globe. Well, that proves that speaking about copetiton-unfriendly environment is nothing more like shit, but if you repeat it as many times as needed, it will become a commonly accepted axiom and a justificatiom of putting your sticky fingers over Apple\u2019s wealth, by fining them another billion penalty or so. Anyway, even when I am using some specific services via iOS, there are numerous examples of services which allows me to pay for the subscription using credit card or Paypal directly. But usually I still I prefer paying Apple their 15% (not 30% in this case!) as a cost of the comfort Apple Pay offers. Sorry, I just don\u2019t feel being limited and I don\u2019t feel service providers and developers are limited in offering me their products. Contrary, I absolutely enjoy almost unlimited (!) possibilities and services offered by today\u2019s technology and it would make me VERY angry if you\u2019d guys who want to regulate all the ascpects of how I am spending my money, will cause in the drastical drop of the quality of the products and services I am currently satisfied with. I am also waiting for statutory obligation to allow third party applications, of course in the name of my customer freedom, democratic society values and stuff, coz I can\u2019t wait of malware stealing my bank credentials after getting tricked into installing it. And in final, you will tell me that\u2019s all my fault because I am an idiot who don\u2019t know how to use a smartphone, installing random stuff without being careful enough. Thanks. I really enjoy being an idiot right now and I am very happy that there is a product offering me satisfying level of protection from my own ignorance, for a price that I accept. If you want to stick your regulatory hands into that, you will clearly make harm to MY customer rights. But fuck this, I\u2019ve been overvoted by democratic society. Duh. The only democratic value I see in your position is that the majority voted for Apple\u2019s offer being too expensive, so it\u2019s our fucking duty to get the prices lowered, even by force. You forgot to add that in the name of all people\u2019s equality, all the prices and underlying fees should be totally unified between every platforms, even if that\u2019d mean either they\u2019ll become equal in the means of quality, or rather \u201equality\u201d in a short time. Or I\u2019ll be forced to pay the difference in the higher price of new iPhone device. Oh thank you democratic society, I will really appreciate that. Finally, I wonder about another thing. I understand that getting 30% cut is illegal and undemocratic, getting 3% is not. So can you tell us what is the exact percentage value of the borderline between being democratic + competition-friendly and being badass corp? Is let\u2019s say 12% would be illegal or not, according to your current democratic moods\u2026 I mean: laws?"}

That is why I am perfectly satisfied with the direction Apple took in case of protecting people from unnecessary exposure to dangers which came along with mobile phones development or even protecting them from their own stupidity\u2026 iOS devices perfectly meet my needs and I love the fact that the all this security is included in the iPhone\u2019s price. Oh, but I like sideloading apps too. I\u2019ve purchased my own cert at Apple (rather avoiding all the suspicious third-party signing services) and again, I now have a lot of sideloaded emulators and stuff. I can sign ipa\u2019s right on device and install them right away offline (eSign). Due to my own security concerns I never sideload stuff that I can get in AppStore and I rather focus on open source based software. But I would never be that aware and careful if not the barriers put by Apple and time spent on trying to understand how the stuff works and avoiding them. And you know what? Since time I have understood what I was doing, I have more freedom in using my device that you can expect. I just had to gain enough knowledge and experience in gaining it. And I\u2019m thankful that my family members, who aren\u2019t anyway tech oriented, do not know how to sideload on they own because I care about them. And now you are telling me that I have purchased product created in the narration of political dictators and regimes? WOW!!! And I am very upset when I read all the comments about your lack of freedom. You guys are morons. It is YOU who want to TAKE MY FREEDOM of being able to buy myself a device with all that security measures included for protecting me and my folks and not ever thinking about it, just because you demand giving you your \"freedom\" of sideloading Instagram++or something. And it is only YOU who wants to TAKE APPLE\u2019S FREEDOM of creating devices with security rather than easiness of hacking them in mind which is appreciated by me and millions of satisfied customers around the world, only because you have redefined \u201efreedom\u201d over your own needs just like that regime leaders you were speaking of!! Fuck you. I do not want my satisfaction get fucked up only because of dudes like you. You are free to buy yourself a factory, make your own device, write your own OS and sideload what you want.

Creating secure devices by force is not a thing to cheer at, you know why? Because those who put their extreme security (which doesn't exist) first could do with just a mode switch, just like you switch the night shift mode on and off, same way you could choose between high security and low, JUST AS YOU DO IN THE MACs. No need to write that large text, i though you wrote me a poem at first. Think first, it's not a justification what you want for your family for Apple to limit in such a way. Reasons are other but hey, political correctness and business laws, rather than them fighting for your sec. and by that Apple being considered as the most closed system all over the systems of whole world. Hope you understood the main idea."}

Obviously i dont wanna parrot the usual \u2018its just a scam\u2019 just for the sake of keeping everyones sanity, but please do check with apple officials (either their official website or phone number) to contact them directly. Sideloading scams are common, and is just a good measure to be extra cautious. Do send the original email and the sender specifically to not just us for more context but to apple as well, as it is common to misread or misinterpret emails as legitimate. One scam almost fooled me completely and looked like it was sent directly from facebook, only to put two and two together and realize A. I dont have a facebook, and B. They typically would rename everything to Meta. Sadly that email is long gone and I cannot show the original, but it\u2019s to drill in the message of cautiousness. Sideloading theoretically should not be bannable (even, and for as long as I\u2019ve been in the community, we haven\u2019t seen one that is confirmed as of yet). Nothing is seen in the US, where there aren\u2019t even any laws forcing apple to allow sideloading.

The sad side with some apps, (looks at TikTok), that even if no new feature gets added or any bugs get fixed. They have a bad side of demanding updating to the latest app version. I do use Signulous but don\u2019t have an Apple Dev account. But I do also use a rooted Android tablet. I wonder if anyone has fixed iOS 15/16, and finally fixed it so any \u201cofficial\u201d link on Safari, will go directly to whatever modded app version is already installed, instead of expecting the latest AppStore version. At least with Android, it is very easy to mod the apk and kill pop-ups/pop-unders, and notifications that insist on updating. What might make it easier, would be if there was a way like Platinmods has. Where a forum could be set up, so users could be able to more easily mod their own apps, and be able to upload \u201ccommunity\u201d user mods. Since some apps update weekly or daily, so the latest versions would always be available. Sadly, TrollStore doesn\u2019t work at all with iOS 16, and a number of their app versions are often an app version or two behind the latest app versions. A good example would be Grindr. Sadly, like a number of apps, updates are all server side. However, a number of things can still be done if anyone would release a Grindr++, to kill any nag screen to update, and kill pop-ups/pop-unders, and kill built in ads. True, it doesn\u2019t give Grindr Xtra features. But at least nag screens and ads can be killed off. I know \u201cblah blah\u201d no cracke\u2026apps blah blah. I have never supported the idea of stealing from developers. I just wish that the Sinful iPhone site still existed. It was one of the best sites for being able to gut out all the built in bloat in built-in apps and AppStore apps. I know iOSGods exists, but it is nowhere nearly as good as the Sinful site used to be."}

Update: For anyone that stumbled across this comment in future. The issue isn't with the DLTikTok IPA but rather with how Signulous signs it's IPA's. I installed using E-sign with no issues, Tried multiple versions with Signulous with no luck. I contacted Signulous support so I'll see if that goes anywhere.

Please avoid all communication with the disgusting users named directly in this post, and anyone else who is involved with MySign/defending MySign.

This comment will have everything you need to know about iOS sideloading. First and foremost, **do not let others convince you to buy a signing service.** Signing services allow you to install as many apps as you want but there are a few things to note: 1 - They are reselling developer services from Apple. 2 - Your apps can randomly get revoked, or you can get blacklisted. 3 - These signing services do not care about you. They may claim to come with revoke protection or something else similar but odds are they won\u2019t honor it, or they will take days to do something. My motto is that sideloading should be free for everyone, and if we aren\u2019t paying *Apple* to do it, why would we pay random people? Now, onto the **good** stuff: The BEST way to sideload right now is with SideStore + LiveContainer. Currently, with a free developer account, you can sideload 3 apps. LiveContainer is an app to get around that, it\u2019s basically our sideload launcher. LiveContainer allows you to \u201cinstall\u201d apps inside of it and then run them, all within LiveContainer. Now, how do we install LiveContainer? With Sidestore! Sidestore is a fork of Altstore that **does NOT** require connecting to a computer to refresh apps. Combining Sidestore (easy refresh with no computer) and LiveContainer (no 3-app limit), we can basically sideload as many apps as we want without ever having to worry about them running out or anything else. LiveContainer allows you to install .ipa files very similar to android and APKs once it\u2019s all setup. Recently a new version of LiveContainer actually came out that combines *it* WITH Sidestore. Getting a **perfect** sideload setup is actually as easy as following the guide found on www.sidestore.io but installing `LiveContainer+Sidestore.ipa` instead of `Sidestore.ipa` which can be found at [the LiveContainer Github repository]( As for EU features, at one point, for a small amount of time, there was a way to *try* to enable EU features but it barely worked then and doesn\u2019t work at all now unfortunately. Regarding apps like Youtube Revanced, I would recommend YTLitePlus, you can find it on google, it will be the first result. It has no ads, all premium features, SponsorBlock integration, and a TON more. I hope this helps, if you have any questions, I will try my best to answer them! P.S. There is an app on iOS called shortcuts, this allows you to make little automations for your phone, you can even make one to refresh your apps every single night so you **really** never have to worry about refreshing your apps. Everything works pretty smoothly as of lately when it comes to sideloading on iOS."}

Unfortunately, a few days ago, as you all know, Apple basically wiped out a majority of signing services in the sideloading scene. That is why I have written this guide for setting up LiveContainer + SideStore in pretty good detail, it covers exactly what you need to know from start to finish and has tutorials for both Sideloadly and AltServer so you can use your preferred .ipa installer. I hope you guys appreciate this guide and can get some of your sideloaded apps back! It took quite a while to write so I\u2019m hoping it can help out a decent amount of people. With that being said I have linked to the guide, give it a read! It\u2019s pretty long but covers everything you will need and is decently fool-proof. Thank you for your time, and as always, check out [LC-DL]( for your LiveContainer apps."}

Flekstore is a prime example. It\u2019s IMPOSSIBLE to get .ipas from Flekstore without paying money and they have a lot of paid/modded games. Why in the world should I pay to pirate a game or app? That defeats the entire point! You can argue it\u2019s a plus to buying into the signing services but once again, they are profiting off Apple in ways they clearly say NOT TO DO. Don\u2019t get me wrong I don\u2019t think we should all stick to what the big company says, I love freeing, modding, and jailbreaking my devices, but not for a fee. It\u2019s also the unreliability that comes from paying for a signing service. We can see that clearly in the revoke wave that just happened. I don\u2019t believe you should be paying any amount of money, from $4 to $20 for something you can do for free. Is it less convenient? Yeah of course. Do I enjoy *not* being locked into a MONTHLY or yearly **subscription** just so sideload? Definitely."}

Many developers unrelated to sideloading progression and capabilities have also been affected, as Apple has put TOS limitations into affect they decided to abuse all at once. At the moment, there is no estimated date that Apple is going to reinstate accounts in their Developer Program, nor are they allowing creation of new accounts at this exact time. Other methods of sideloading that do not use developer certification are currently recommended at this time, and this is to be the expectation going forward. It is very unfortunate but the community standard likely will need to change, as certification is now completely unstable, and service providers will need to switch to adapt these methods to stay afloat. Please feel free to use this thread to comment and discuss recent revokes, what's next, and we highly encourage service providers to interact closely with their customer bases at this time to provide transparency about their plans for the future."}

Is there a safe way to disable some extensions?", "content": "So I'm trying to install SCInsta with SideStore, built SCInsta myself using the guide on SoCuul's GitHub which went relatively fine. I'm encountering an issue stemming from the 10 App ID limit, currently I have 3 App IDs being used (SideStore, the SideStore AltWidget, and Apollo) but SCInsta requires 8 App IDs to install which is insane. I tried to install SCInsta keeping the extensions (which failed immediately), then tried to do an install with some extensions enabled (using 'Choose App Extension') which failed but registered the App IDs anyways. So now I'm in the position of having exhausted all but one of my App IDs until they reset in a week. I'd prefer to keep Apollo because the stock Reddit app is terrible, and so was wondering if there's a safe way to disable some of the extensions for Instagram or alternatively the SideStore Widget extension which could be safer. I know LiveContainer exists, but comes with certain caveats, so I'd prefer to not use it if possible. Anyone done anything similar?"}

Altstore PAL let\u2019s you only install approved apps, you can\u2019t just install any app you want. To sideload modified iOS apps (.ipa) you need to do it through Sidestore or AltStore Classic or Sideloadly. Sidestore is a fork of Altstore that, after the initial setup that requires a PC/Mac, lets you refresh the apps straight from the device (apps need to be refreshed/resigned at least every 7 days in order to keep working, same for Altstore and Sideloadly). LiveContainer is an app that can be installed along Sidestore and lets you bypass the 3 apps per device limit, it\u2019s optional but convenient if you want to install more than 3 apps per device. Buying a paid certificate is another alternative to sideload apps. This method doesn\u2019t require a pc/Mac and allows to install unlimited apps. The downside is that the certificate can be revoked at any time. Lately Apple has revoked most of the certificate from the most known signing providers so this might not be the ideal time to purchase a paid certificate. Also another alternative is the DNS method which is free, doesn\u2019t require a pc/Mac and lets you install unlimited apps. Downsides are that is pretty clunky to set up and keep it working, and can be unreliable as it takes advantage of Enterprise certificates in order to work. IMO the most convenient option atm is still Sidestore+LiveContainer. Once it\u2019s set up you can automate the refreshing process through the Shortcut app and install multiple apps using LiveContainer. Hope this can help."}

You aren\u2019t \u201cthe man.\u201d You\u2019re just full of lies, pretending to be something you\u2019re not while scamming people left and right.
