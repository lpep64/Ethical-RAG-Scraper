As a result, this content has been deleted. In April 2023, Reddit announced drastic changes that would destroy 3rd party applications - the very apps that drove Reddit's success. As the community began to protest, Reddit undertook a massive campaign of deception, threats, and lies against the developers of these applications, moderators, and users. At its worst, Reddit's CEO, Steve Huffman (u/spez) attacked one of the developers personally by posting false statements that effectively constitute libel. Despite this shameless display, u/spez has refused to step down, retract his statements, or even apologize. Reddit also blocked users from deleting posts, and replaced content that users had previously deleted for various reasons. This is a brazen violation of data protection laws, both in California where Reddit is based and internationally. Forcing users to use only the official apps allows Reddit to collect more detailed and valuable personal data, something which it clearly plans to sell to advertisers and tracking firms. It also allows Reddit to control the content users see, instead of users being able to define the content they want to actually see. All of this is driving Reddit towards mass data collection and algorithmic control. Furthermore, many disabled users relied on accessible 3rd party apps to be able to use Reddit at all. Reddit has claimed to care about them, but the result is that most of the applications they used will still be deactivated. This fake display has not fooled anybody, and has proven that Reddit in fact does not care about these users at all. These changes were not necessary. Reddit could have charged a reasonable amount for API access so that a profit would be made, and 3rd party apps would still have been able to operate and continue to contribute to Reddit's success. But instead, Reddit chose draconian terms that intentionally targeted these apps, then lied about the purpose of the rules in an attempt to deflect the backlash. Find alternatives. Continue to remove the content that we provided. Reddit does not deserve to profit from the community it mistreated."}

I used it through it's whole life cycle. I think there were three main issues. First during XPs life time the specs on low and mid range PCs available were shit. Celerons, and Semprons, were as bad as their names. You'd have an Intel graphics chipset which were embarrassingly buggy and under powered. Unless you bought a decent PC then it would be barely running XP already. With Vista there was no chance. Second is that software had more of a push to require upgrading your hardware. Obviously it depends on the PC; but today Windows 10 can run very well on a 5 year old PC. Vista would not have run well on a 5 year old PC of the time. This isn't just a Windows thing though. The industry as a whole has moved like this. Third is that for Vista they re-wrote huge chunks of the internals of Windows. Across the board. XPs scheduler was originally built for single core machines so it was properly redone in Vista. Changes on resource management so it was more difficult for one application to starve others; for example this prevents music stuttering whilst you are doing something intensive. Sound could be split by application. The graphics driver model was changed; it was now much harder for the driver to crash the OS. Changes to memory management increasing security. The list goes on and the changes were huge. At the time Vista was released a lot of this work was legitimately slow. In particular disk IO was really fucking bad. Copying a file on the same machine could end up being 2x slower, or worse. It was also fairly buggy in many respects. A separate aspect is that a lot of their work broke applications which did bad things. For example the memory management I mentioned above. There were applications which would access memory that didn't exist and yet still ran on XP. On Vista they'd crash. Who got the blame? Windows of course. Not the application. Overall I found Vista more stable than XP. It was also much better than XP."}

Changes to Windows made Vista a lot more secure than XP, this was because of some major viruses that hit XP in the few years before Vista was released. Microsoft ended up scrapping the original OS that was going to replace XP to work on Vista instead. These changes made things like drivers needing to be redone, and having proper multiple tiers of permissions and user access, so you could run a computer without administrative rights (just like Mac and Linux) without compromising usability. The problem was it takes time for change, both for users and developers. Add steep hardware requirements (Vista Premium needed a higher than average powered computer at the time) made it run like crap on weaker machines. With some patches and service packs, Vista was tweaked to lighten its load and make the security easier to deal with, and today it is virtually indistinguishable from Windows 7 other than the task bar. Of course by time computers, developers, and users got with the times, the damage was done and Windows 7 came out to great fanfare."}

As a result, this content has been deleted. In April 2023, Reddit announced drastic changes that would destroy 3rd party applications - the very apps that drove Reddit's success. As the community began to protest, Reddit undertook a massive campaign of deception, threats, and lies against the developers of these applications, moderators, and users. At its worst, Reddit's CEO, Steve Huffman (u/spez) attacked one of the developers personally by posting false statements that effectively constitute libel. Despite this shameless display, u/spez has refused to step down, retract his statements, or even apologize. Reddit also blocked users from deleting posts, and replaced content that users had previously deleted for various reasons. This is a brazen violation of data protection laws, both in California where Reddit is based and internationally. Forcing users to use only the official apps allows Reddit to collect more detailed and valuable personal data, something which it clearly plans to sell to advertisers and tracking firms. It also allows Reddit to control the content users see, instead of users being able to define the content they want to actually see. All of this is driving Reddit towards mass data collection and algorithmic control. Furthermore, many disabled users relied on accessible 3rd party apps to be able to use Reddit at all. Reddit has claimed to care about them, but the result is that most of the applications they used will still be deactivated. This fake display has not fooled anybody, and has proven that Reddit in fact does not care about these users at all. These changes were not necessary. Reddit could have charged a reasonable amount for API access so that a profit would be made, and 3rd party apps would still have been able to operate and continue to contribute to Reddit's success. But instead, Reddit chose draconian terms that intentionally targeted these apps, then lied about the purpose of the rules in an attempt to deflect the backlash. Find alternatives. Continue to remove the content that we provided. Reddit does not deserve to profit from the community it mistreated."}

Windows 2000 (and NT previously) had a driver model that was decent enough to work, but had some serious problems from a driver safety standpoint (a driver doing an errant \"move this over here\" at the wrong time? That's a BSOD at best, \"oops you got kernel level pwned\" at worst). Microsoft said \"hey, folks, we're moving to a new system (a superset of a thing called WDDM, referring to the display drivers), you should use it. We're going to include it in XP but keep the old model around so your shit still works. Fair warning, it's going away.\" A lot of sound drivers did pick up this new model, which was technically superior in a lot of ways (drivers could oops a bit, things could fail gracefully, etc) and for the most part, it worked. Things were Pretty OK. Vista came along and the kernel team said \"This driver model REALLY doesn't jive with the idea of kernel-level security. We should rip it out. Good thing we told the device driver folks to develop against the NEW THING, RIGHT?\" OEMs and vendors cannot be trusted to not open their mouth and insert both barrels of the BFG then go \"WAIT YOU SAID TO DEFINITELY PULL THE TRIGGER?\" As you can probably guess, hardware vendors didn't do diddly shit except when they were pushed hard. Microsoft as a stopgap added a shell around old XP era drivers that let them kinda work, but not at their full potential. It was, by all means, a terrifying success too: A lot of drivers shipped for XP got wrapped up in this layer (because, as we've established, hardware vendors **suck**) and OEMs were in a strange phase of barrel-scraping. There's a point, somewhere between US$550 and US$650 where computers become \"not crap\". Depending on the year, this can be higher (sometimes up in the $700 range) or lower. This tipping point is where it's too expensive for the manufacturer to cut corners on the device to get the thing out the door and into the hands of users. It's just above the comfortably \"affordable\" level at big-box club retailers such as Sam's Club and Costco. It's typically the median of the top 20% of machines sold there in terms of price. Above this point, you get pretty decent harwdare. When budgeting a new computer today, you should actually aim for the \"About $800\" end-user price range. ASUS, Dell and HP all sell slightly better devices under this price bracket. Below that point of cost-cutting and it's a game of greed: The machines are typically terrible and have problems such as out of date everything, cost-cutting components (AMD APUs were meant for a *very* different market than they're in now and it shows) and generally shit products.^note1 Computer cost barrel-scraping has been a race to the bottom since the 1990's. When you bought a computer in 1998 or so, you got basically just Windows, some OEM software (i.e. software intended to sell you more from the OEM; Sony was good at this) and maybe a single application. As computers become more commodity items (*especially* around the point when XP was in its hayday, 2004 or so), it started a race to the bottom: You could buy a computer and somewhere around a quarter to half the software pre-installed was vendorware: Antivirus software, Photoshop Elements, etc. Why, you ask? ***Profit margin***, my good friend: By taking and reducing the cost of the machine through lucrative \"We'll include your software on our computers for $X per one we sell,\" this reduced the cost of the components to the point it was only a net gain for the OEMs. Back to Vista: The cost of a license for Vista Starter/Basic was cheap. What it meant was that a desktop computer built originally for XP could be labeled as \"Vista Ready\" -- it met the *bare minimum requirements* and didn't ship with more than 1GB of RAM in most cases, making it Vista Starter, or 4GB of RAM making it Home Basic \"ready\" -- and thus making it salable past the XP EOL days. Those devices were terrible. They were, however, the most common. They got re-certified with more RAM, different hardware overall to get the \"home premium\" badge and then *actually* sold with limited amounts of RAM. Once they had been recertified by Microsoft, the old shoes came back on and the bad habits got brought back. So what's this got to do with drivers? In a cost-cutting measure, the drivers from Windows XP boxes got rebuilt an smashed into Vista's driver model. That, or they were terribly generic ones Microsoft had built to cover the range of devices that were typical. Thus, we get terrible devices from the Vista era. 7 was pushed with a lot of \"If you want to have devices certified, you **must** have up to date drivers,\" thus making the market for devices running 7 a smaller, but better one overall. ^note1: This, curiously enough, is why the screen resolution 1440x768 is popular. Back in the 90's and early 2000's, it wasn't uncommon to see panels in the \"1920x1280\" range. 4:3 LCDs were common and the ultrawidescreen 16:9 that we know today were more expensive and considered a luxury item. \"HD Video\" was declared to be 720 vertical pixels tall, 16:9 or similar. This meant that Chinese LCD panel manufacturers could take their existing 4:3 1024x768 pipeline and add some horizontal pixels. Because horizontal pixels are easier to manufacture than vertical pixels (that is, making something wide as fuck is easier than cramming more pixels into the same space), it was just a matter of re-tooling their pipeline. Even today, we get these terrible scourges floating around. 1080p displays are becoming cheaper as manufacturing techniques improve and 4K displays become \"the norm\", but those small, cramped LCDs will still rule the roost in terms of availability."}

Source: the 9 Fitbits my wife and I have owned. In fairness we've only paid for four. They replaced her first Charge, and I took the old one until it completely fell apart. I got her a Charge HR for our anniversary, she got me one for Christmas. The warranty was always good and they kept sending us new ones every few months until recently. You see, they don't make the Charge HR anymore. You'd think that her still-under-warranty Charge HR would get her a free Charge 2 if that's the replacement product, but you'd be wrong. Nope, all her warranty gets her is $25 off any new Fitbit, if we buy it through the website, which about covers the shipping. And the fucking Charge 2 still isn't waterproof, and judging by the one my brother in law has it still falls apart in a few months I'm going to just get her an Apple watch. You can take that swimming at least. Yea it costs as much as 3 Fitbits but they seem to last at least 18 months so I'll break even."}

Personally I would get a Fitbit Charge 2 if I had to buy again. It's been nice having smart watch features but I really don't need to preview picture messages on my wrist, and I could do without the Star Trek style phone calls. That's just my opinion because I don't take advantage of the apps that are available for the watch. For accuracy, the step counter works great. It doesn't pick up false steps when I'm driving the equipment at work, which is pretty impressive. Fitbit units do pick up a lot of false steps when you're using a hammer or having a wank. The exercise detection is great too, but since I'm extremely active at work I had to turn off the notifications that pop up mid exercise. They got really annoying. Is that a text? Nope, just hit 10 minutes of moving about. I would call its workout detection about equal with the Fitbit."}

I just flipped my room around and my control remote works better now. Much faster. I was talking to the maintenance guy about it and I figured it out. But I think white people take things out of context. In the new orientation the tv is in the south side and the couch is on the north. Before it was the other way around. See! Thats why, its obvious. Earths magnetic field goes from north to south, like little lines. And now when I use the control remote the electrons from the ir reciever go north to south, because the tv is southbound. See, the electrons ride the waves, its like a surf board. Its like ether waves man, Einstien did work on this in the basements of his manhattan place with metal plates that detected the ether waves of the universe. Thats what MC squared means man. So the magnetic field of earth is like the ether field of the earth. And before my couch was swapped, so the electrons from the remote control were going against the waves man. Like riding against the current. You can't surf like that. So everyone should align their rooms southbound. Also place your wifi router north, so that the signal falls onto everything instead of being blown away. Thats fengshui dude. So the point of this is that tin foil won't block out the voices unless its aligned in the ether field. The trick is finding a place that isn't contaminated with radiation and is aligned with the ether field but is also out of view of the cameras."}

Because I'm able to do so without conductive fabric does not mean someone may not have a specific application where thicker gloves are required. To me, just an average Michael not wearing any fancy gloves, paying extra for the same pair of gloves save for some special thread does not make sense. I do believe there is a physical difference between my gloves and the conductive tipped ones. I do not believe the conductive tip is necessary. Anyone that is interested in buying special conductive gloves that happens to read my experience here should take from my story one thing: before purchasing new gloves, simply check real quick whether your old ones will do the job. Tldr: if anyone is thinking of buying special gloves that are touch screen friendly, try on your normal gloves and check if they allow touch screen use before making a new purchase that might not be necessary."}

Whether or not the fabric Is different is irrelevant when it comes to comparing functionality (which is why I said they don't \"need\" special thread) if we are able to buy a similar product for much cheaper that effectively gets the same job done. When I said you are just buying a label, I did not intend to imply that there is not going to actually be a physical difference in the glove as well. What I meant was that because functionally the gloves I seen were no warmer and no more effective than my dollar store gloves, and that people who seen the sticker would pay to upgrade their gloves for no reason essentially paying for a sticker as I see it. I don't care about material. I care about function. I want warm hands, flexibility, and touch screen compatibility.

I don't exactly remember what he said because I was getting real fuckin' dysphoric at the sight of that thing being broken. The USB connector itself was snapped and some of the traces were lifted off. Fortunately I figured it was salvageable so I took it back with me to my office. We have these trade shows where we collect these little \"dummy\" USB drives that don't contain the flash chip on them. They're basically like demo units that you can use as a reference so you can figure out where you wanna attach a logo or something. Anyway, I have like few dozen of these bad boys so I rip one apart and get at the logic board. I basically jumpered it onto the new stick. I used some hot glue over where I jumpered it on the old USB drive because some of the traces were lifting up. If I ever find the stick I'll take a picture and show you the abomination. It still works to this day."}

Many think that and it's the wrong way to think, trust me. I do a huge amount of work for free, and the irony is, it makes me a huge amount of money. When customers realise you're there to help and because you like the job, and not just to take their money - they come back for everything. I probably get around \u00a3100-150 in tips a month (remembering that we don't tip in the UK), and a large amount of regular and repeat custom. Those near me that charge for every little thing, end up with about half the trade I do. Maybe less. I help out people as much as I can, and try to go out of my way to sort people, and they pay pretty handsomely over the top of my invoice (sometimes literally doubling it to the tune of \u00a350 or so) and they're comfortable to come in for the small jobs. I never take the piss, I never ask for more than I've quoted, but I'd say around 5-10% pay over the bill at least once. Many shops don't want \u00a35 and \u00a310 jobs either, but I'm more than happy. If someone wants to pay me \u00a35 to install software from a disc they bought themselves, I'm quite happy to double click it and let it run. Shops that turn their nose up at jobs like that are \u00a35 down, but more important a customer down.

My hot storage is a WD Re4 Gold frontline enterprise hard drive, with Windows Update writing incremental backups to it - since it's designed for 550TB/year and 24/7/365 operation for 5 years, it'll effectively never wear out in a desktop as a hot-store drive.

I also have network storage and offsite options at the ready. Last time I had a hard drive crash I was back up and running (after an OS reinstall) in 40 minutes."}

I found the two wires that, when connected, allow the PA microphone to be used. I couldn\u2019t keep them connected the whole time though, as the switch function was wired into another wire so it would just be constantly running. So I band aided the two wire ends to the index card, then straightened and stripped the wax coating off of the paper clip and adhered it to the top of the card. Now when you press the top part down, the metal paper clip completes the circuit allowing me to use the microphone as I desire without having to manually hold the wires together."}

This is just switching a push-to-talk signal, probably a logic-level voltage within the unit. It's designed to be switched, so it's totally safe to short the white wires together, since that's what the real switch would do every time you push it. The red and black, we're less certain about. They're probably there to supply power to an integrated mic preamp, but this setup obviously doesn't need them. Assuming that's what they're for, they probably supply between 2 and 8 volts, and have a source impedance up in the hundreds of kilohms, so the available current is miniscule. Audio signals are *tiny* and you don't want your bias to swamp them. It's also possible that the red and black wires are used to light an on-air LED or something; some desk microphones have this. In that case, they're supplying between 1 and 3 volts, and current-limited to 20 mA or less. Again utterly inconsequential to short indefinitely. If you have other theories as to why this setup might be hazardous, I'd love to hear them!"}

It's paramount for many people. So for me anyway since I can't speak for anyone else, the IT in me say this is neat and cleverly done. Kudos. The Medic in me says get the fuck off my work site. I am of course assuming the OP works in a dangerous industry and isn't just near loud stationary enclosed equipment that they could operate safely around entirely without hearing. Or other such tasks one could operate deaf. Hearing protection doesn't block all noise. It blocks most and if you have good set it'll specifically let the vocal range of noise in. You know. For safety. Music or other vocals from a podcast could very well and easily prevent them from being able to respond in the event of for example simply not hearing the guy yelling to get out of the way of the cement roller being driven by another guy who did this and isn't hearing the calls over the radio that someone (you) is in the way and not responding. If it doesn't present a danger to anyone then there is no issue. but given the OP is going for stealth Im assuming he's not allowed to do this, and likely for good reason."}

One of the most common was, during their prayer breaks or other stops, pouring 5 gallon jerry cans full of water over their radiators, for example. Another one we saw was a little Kia truck that had a large tank in the bank and a hose running to a hole cut in the hood. At first we thought it was fuel, but upon closer inspection the man showed us it was a water reservoir with its own pump to keep the radiator full because the car was constantly overheating and blowing out the excess water as steam. We had our own problems with this early on until one of our veteran mechanics - as in from the first gulf war - came along and calmly cut a vacuum line in every engine and looped it back on itself. Whatever this controlled, it completely unthrottled the cooling system on our humvees so we didn't have overheating problems anymore."}

Coolant runs through the firewall into your dash and through a heater core which is where the hot air comes from. You can cut the coolant hose and loop it back on itself to bypass this entirely. A lot of people do it on older cars if the heater core is broken or leaking, because cutting a hose in the engine bay is much easier than pulling out the dash to fix a leak or replace the heater. Although I'm not sure how that would help if your car was overheating."}

Grandparents kept wondering where all the batteries from their devices went, I used them for my experiments. Turns out: put more batteries in series than the device normally allows, and most things (kid's toys, at least in the mid-90's) got louder or faster, until they stopped functioning. Less batteries made them slower and quieter. Flashlights were the first things I tested, since they were easy to tape/wire more batteries to. I later tried a bunch of more toys (and broke a lot of them). I at some point realized that there's a difference between the sizes of batteries, AAA being in smaller things (remotes, and such), AA in a little larger (small toys), C in medium and D in big things (A radio being an exception, it had AA and D cells in it). So there was some relation to power and the size of the battery. Big things usually also worked on wall power, so I decided to try and power one of the toys with wall power, grabbed a C7-ended cable and plugged the wires in there, then put it in the wall. It made a bang, and then I was told not to try using wall power for my experiments again. Just a really curious kid, I believe it. Electronics is still a hobby of mine."}

The only real difference between AA's and AAA's is the charge capacity. I'm not an expert, but I understand that AA's go from about 1.65V fully charged to about 1.4V dead, which leads me to believe that this toy takes 3 because it might need uncomfortably close to 3.2V to operate. Technically, two would work, as evidenced by the picture, but it only works for a little while until the two batteries discharge enough to drop below that voltage."}

There are later Macbook Pros (and, as you said, Macbook Airs from that timeframe) that pull air through the keyboard. Theatrical gels are usually polycarbonate or sometimes polyester, not cellophane (regenerated cellulose) as OP\u2019s post states was used here. Using polycarbonate theatrical gels rather than regenerated cellulose would also explain the lack of audio bleed/unwanted harmonics due to their density and thickness. It would also be smart to cut/leave gaps between them as you stated, but it doesn\u2019t look like OP did that. Yes, there are ways to do this properly; no one disputed that. But, I stand by my suggestion that using cellophane as stated in the title of the post may be damaging to the system, especially in a laptop which may be moved and carried around on a regular basis. Edit: Cellophane melts at 220F. The interior of the average laptop can get up to 212F. Should you put the computer down somewhere it doesn\u2019t have ideal ventilation, there is a reasonable chance the cellophane will melt."}

This clock keeps time by using the frequency of your power supply, so you set the switch on the clock to match whatever it is where you live.

I did have a few lm2596 buck converters laying around, so if I ended up needing to switch 12 down to 9 it wouldn't have been a problem. At that point I went down to my giant trash bag of obsolete appliance power supplies, and found a wall wart with a coaxial plug that fit the back of the clock, and then snipped the plug and cable off the transformer brick. Then I used a multimeter to find which lead was positive and which was ground (after stripping an inch or so off, of course.) I labeled each wire with a piece of sticky note and then traced the outline of a 9 volt battery on the corner of a 1x4. I cut it out using a handsaw, and then pressed the end of the 9 volt into the end of the wooden block to score some locator marks before I tapped roofing tacks into the center of the marks. Get the terminals right, wrap the loose wire around the TENS unit, rubber band the unit to the back of the clock, turn it on to the desired pain setting, and hey presto. You can find picturesof the back of the clock by ctrl-F'ing the comment thread."}

I may be biased because I'm an engineering student, but once you understand the relationship between charges -> coulomb's law/faraday's law -> coulombs -> volts -> amps -> watts -> ohms -> AC current -> inductance/henries -> RMS and imaginary numbers/impedance and all that kind of stuff it becomes really intuitive to understand what needs to be done in when designing a basic analog circuit. For instance, when I made this thing it was way easier to make than I expected it would. The vibration motor output was capable of supplying way more current than the TENS unit would ever draw, and they were both the same voltage (9 volts, the amount the clock's wall wart supplied.) I literally just wired the output to the unit with no intervention whatsoever, and it worked perfectly. If the voltage of the clock were higher for instance, I would have needed some kind of step down voltage regulator (an LM2596 \"buck converter\" in this case) and that would have acted to bring 12v or 15v or whatever down to 9. If you have a good basis in all the math you learn before calculus it will come naturally to you."}

You may end up spending a night in what is roughly a 2-star hotel that is very expensive to your insurance company, connected to a lot of sensors, and then maybe you'll get a machine to strap to your head before you go to sleep, but most importantly, you will actually go to sleep. (It wasn't unpleasant in the least-- just the blanket was really scratchy.) My brain was waking itself up 99 times an hour on average. That's about every 40 seconds. I was at a point where I hadn't had a deep restful sleep in literal years. When I got my sleep study and they put me on CPAP at around midnight (something they would've done later, but I was sleeping so badly they couldn't believe it), I slept until 10:30, and woke up practically euphoric from being rested, because of this thing called REM Rebound. Getting better sleep also makes your body stop producing urine at night, meaning CPAP made me not have to pee every single overnight. The change is real. Aside from the cost (something like $1000 every 5 years), it's all upsides. Sorry for evangelizing here, but if Apnea's what you have, you can fix it, for real."}

If you want an AC adapter, but one of the thousands of different adapters you can find everywhere) and older devices like it took 12V to operate. He didn't seem to understand his mistake, and even asked for a discount on the repair fee because \"its a simple fix\" I explained to him that he sent almost 3 times the expected current through the device and will be lucky if they charge him my quote and don't tell him its dead and to buy a new one. Also, the number of people who can't comprehend using an open standard to power a device is unbeleivable. Sometimes they insist on ordering an adapter (even after I tell them they can get them at dollar stores, gas stations, department stores and electronics stores) so I send them to a third party who charges about $30 for a 5V1A USB adapter, because that's the only company I'm authorized to provide a phone number for."}

I still think it's the best mouse ever made, despite the fact that it's not optical and doesn't have a scroll wheel. edit: I almost forgot, they did one last iteration with that shape as the Logitech WingMan Force Feedback Mouse that came with a weird mouse pad and was also USB. Apparently it is not well supported past Windows 98? I also remember, once, seeing a miniature version of the bear claw shape that was Dell branded. Super weird because most of the point of this thing is the size in your hand... edit 2: Apparently the Force Feedback one required the mouse pad because that is where it got it's power?"}

Here's a quick rundown of what's likely wrong and how to fix it: Give your controller a gentle shake. Sound like you've got a small piece of something rattling around in there? You likely do. What happens (particularly on my left stick from the \"sprint\" action) is a piece of plastic separates from the module inside the controller. It acts as a retainer of sorts and helps the stick return to 0. Get on Alibaba or Amazon or your supplier of choice and order a joystick module specifically for xbox one. It DOES matter. Once it's in, disassemble your controller. The back side of the grips can be pulled off to expose several security style torx screws and there's one under the label in the battery compartment. Remove those screws and gently separate your controller case. Be mindful of your buttons, they're a bitch to put back in. Once you have access to the board, take a look at the modules. You should notice a difference between the one with drift and the one without. Take a solder iron and sucker, get the iron warm, and heat the solder points for the module one at a time, using your sucker to pull the old solder off. Be careful, you can fry the board if the heat is too high. Once it's out, solder the new module in and you should be good to go. It only goes in one way. Reassemble and test it out."}

Subtract the weight of the can, convert the weight to volume, and you have the amount of gas you have. So, as an example: We measure the canister with an unknown amount of gas to be 2.58kg Subtract the 0.03kg from the canister to get 2.55kg Convert weight to volume and we get 3.4L While for a plastic Jerry can it's less useful, but it would be great for a steel canister.

Ambient room temp is about 35c (I like it hot) and my PC temps average between 32c-52c.

Keeping temps low is a lot more about speed than volume of air since current heatsinks lose effectiveness rather quickly the farther they get from the heat source. While the latter certainly helps with a larger hestsink, the former pulls it's weight much better for a given heatsink size. Empty space simply acts as a buffer for temperature and does more to impede airflow and cause turbulence than assist it. For a given amount of CFM, air will travel much slower through a larger case than a more restrictive or smaller one which means the heated air spends more time heating everything else in the case back up (including the heatsink it just came from) rather than just getting out of it. Servers (or even game consoles) are able to dissipate quite a lot of heat from a very small package by utilizing air speed over volume by minimizing empty space and directing airflow."}

Get a smooth surface like a mirror or piece of glass and try to spin your CPU (upside down) on it. If it spins like a top it's not exactly flat. Same principle for your heatsink. If they stay they're making more flat contact and creating friction hence they are more precisely flat.

On the other hand the non-conductive Kryonaut paste is initially very good but drops after few months of usage, if you have high temperatures. I had the issue on a desktop and a mobile GPU. Prolonged temps above ~70 cause it to dry out quickly. I retried a few times, every time the exact same result (also different batches). After ~half a year, the old cheap go-to MX-2 resulted in better temps! BUT if your temps stay coolish, it stays. I'm using Kryonaut currently on my desktop CPU and haven't re-applied for roughly 1-2 years. The temps haven't changed. The CPU stays even on high load mostly below 60 though."}

IT guy here for small businesses. No one wants you to come back on-site and have to bill them to install a 1' cable just so things look pretty. Hell half of them wouldn't even want to pay for the extra 5 minutes it takes me to walk out to my car to grab one - assuming I have some with me. Why more IT guys don't just bring one with the next time they're on-site is beyond me, though. And as I was always told: 'Most people don't want to pay you 100$+ an hour to make their desk look a little nicer.' Well, maybe the end-user does, but the guy paying the bill doesn't. Not saying I'm doing it correctly by any means, or that I'm proud of coiling a 15' cable, but I'm more than likely to have those on hand than 1 footers as they're more universal, and time is of the essence when someone's down. Just the nature of small businesses that try to cut costs wherever they can."}

Making your own patch cables outside of emergency repairs is a waste of time and more likely to cause issues later. Factory-terminated cables are stronger, more reliable, and under warranty. With higher cabling standards (Cat 6+) it is nearly impossible to manually terminate patch cables to spec. It's also annoying as hell when the cable is just barely long enough and you have to move something. I've replaced many more hand-crimped cables because they failed than factory cables. Most places buy 3-4 different lengths of patch cables so they don't have excessive amounts of cable coiled up inside the cable management. Even if you do end up with a 15' cable to go 6\", if you have sufficient cable management then it won't look bad."}

If you could make a quick release adapter for dell laptops, you could make some serious cash as long as Apple doesn't get litigious (who am I kidding). Edit: I don't understand why this is getting down votes. Would any of you care to explain? I can't tell you how many laptops I've had to re-solder the power connector to the motherboard on because it gets jerked around by the cord. The MagSafe connector does anything but keep it plugged in. Mine falls off on my MacBook Pro way more than it does on my Dell laptop. I can only think that the other laptop makers haven't implemented a similar device is because of a patent owned by Apple, who is notorious for lawsuits over patents. Now, why are you down voting this?"}

I've taken the bevel off a couple of times when I've been maintaining (I frequently do a thorough clean of my internals), but the laptop in general's always felt solid. You may have gotten a dud, or I might have just got the one that happened to be built like a tank. I've accidentally dropped it on hard surfaces more than once and though there's some cosmetic damage on the underside, it still holds together today as well as it did when I got it. Complete contrast to the Dell Studio 1555 I previously had. Decent machine, but it wasn't really the best designed thing on the market. Bits of plastic just fell off, bevel clips started snapping and the hinges just became really loose over time."}

(I get my knowledge from MentalFloss on YT, so I could be wrong!) He could have used any material for his process. The same cannot be said for re-using magnets, or using velcro as we know it now. I'm sure there are other examples which are better suited, so as I say it's a good point. My main grievance is simply in effort. The inventor of velcro went to great lengths to mimic an observation from nature, the idea of just taking velcro and attaching it to a plug and socket, while it's a great little hack, I'm not denying that... does not strike me as something that should be patented, even though in reality it probably can."}

I'm way late to this party, but unless OP's city has some very stringent codes that are in addition to the model building code, it is not required to have a tile in every grid hole. It's not even required to have tiles in ANY grid hole, it's not required to have the grid cover the whole ceiling, and it's not required to have a hanging ceiling grid AT ALL. A couple other notes: If you are going to have a ceiling grid with tiles though... Ceiling tiles have to be non-combustible, BUT NOT fire resistant. This means the tiles have to be able to self extinguish OR never ignite in normal fire conditions. THEY DO NOT have to stop fire from spreading. The \"fix\" shown in op's image is actually against code, because cardboard is combustible. Ceiling tiles also have to disintegrate when saturated with water. This is so when there is a fire, the plenum area above the tiles can be exposed with water from a fire hose. Again, cardboard will not disintegrate if saturated with water, especially cardboard that has a waxy or plastic coating like a mailing envelope. If ceiling tiles were used to stop fire spread (which they are not), then every penetration of the tile would have to be filled with fire resistant packing or foam. Rated fire walls require this packing or foam, it's normally a red colored expanding foam now. Thanks for reading my TED talk. Sauce: I do fire inspections."}

The tile serves the purpose of an aesthetic, a thermal insulation barrier, and a sound barrier. Chances are OP mistook a building inspector for a fire inspector.

I mean most of us have them on our phones. Having a camera on your phone is not just for duck faced selfies and holiday spam. - Going out for the day? there's usually a map in the carpark/visitor centre of many places you might want to visit, from theme parks to nature reserves to seaside resorts. Take a photo and you don't have to either buy a map, or risk getting lost or maybe struggle trying to remember your way around. - Don't want to have to carry that leaflet with the time and place of a particular event, or the business card from that guy who offered you discount that one time? Take a photo. Then you can throw away the leaflets/cards without having to write anything down. - You and your friends standing in a long queue for a food stall at a busy festival and can't decide what you want to eat? walk up to the front of the queue, take a photo of the menu, then go back to your spot, then your whole party can see the menu and your friends will think you're a genius. - Checking into a hotel when on holiday? take a photo of your welcome pack so you can see what times the restaurant is open, the bar opening and closing times, pool opening times and the hotel wifi passwords etc etc. - Parking in a big carpark for a long time like at an airport etc, take a photo of your car, then take a photo of the shuttle bus stop, and you can retrace your steps with ease. - Need to scan a document for quick and easy reference later on, such as a bus/train timetable or a class timetable? Take a snap, it might not be the highest quality but it's better than forgetting and missing your bus. - Need to take something apart to fix it? Take a photo as you're taking it apart so you know what it should look like assembled, you can even go as far as to take photos of the screws as you take them out and then another photo during each step of the process. - Had a road accident? take some snaps the police or your insurance company will thank you, especially if you aren't so great at remembering license plates/car makes etc. Those are just a few ideas, there are million useful reasons for having a camera on your phone, but people seem to forget how useful the ability to capture any image can be. Maybe people are brainwashed from having had to pay to have photos developed in days past and now they feel they can't take a photo unless it's something photoworthy like a family snap or a scenic vista, or as with the younger generation, unless it's a way to feed their own vanity or facebook feeds etc."}

It's all about tablets and holograms and shit now. Not only does nearly everyone not born in some bucolic, agrarian compound have a phone, nearly every one of those phones, down to the shittiest of flip phones, has some semblance of a camera, unless the person *specifically* requested a phone with no camera, which involves blowing the dust of the one box in the store, usually reserved for the odd government employee with some weird security clearance issue. Usually. Every so often, it would be someone convinced the government was spying on him through his camera, which sounds less and less crazy by the day, frankly."}

Back in the day you had to account for a lot more. My first upgrades were full mobo/cpu/ram and twice GPU since they just didn't have the same slots, let alone particularities like the mobo couldn't run the new RAM at the proper speed. And let's not discuss a ton of various molex adaptors to power newfangled SATA/PCI or insufficient powersource since back then i was still running crap stocks 400w sources that barely put out 300 and the 12volt line output was crap, not powering the GPU to full throttle. Overclocking was also a lot more hassle than toying with the multiplyer today and was a lot more 'toeing the line' rather than 'set this to this and there you go, that's why you bought a K version'. But the stepping thing, it's basically processor versions. I had bought a newer stepping that on that particular Mobo was not supported, more to the point 'barely', even with a hacked together BIOS, but the old stepping worked fine. Thing is, upgrading was an actual upgrade back then. You saw instant results, and even were barred from playing games if you didn't have certain technologies (fuck you shader model 1.1/2.0/3.0). Today you can really afford to just upgrade once every 3-4 years since the leaps are getting smaller and so are the felt differences. I'm still running off a 660Ti atm with a I7-2700k and 8GB of RAM that i built.. quite a while ago. Can play the Witcher 3 at pretty good quality at 1920x1080, the only thing i may be missing out on are tiny effects i won't notice even if i care to look for them specifically. Pushing higher resolutions is counterproductive imho, and i'd rather have rock solid FPS with a good illusion of motion (coupled with a monitor, i'm so eyeing new gen IPSes and Gsync), rather than resolution i don't even need when i can throw some AA on 1920 and be perfectly fine."}

I think both would be too much considering most people would be fine with one. Not to mention it would raise the cost of the set just a little higher and possibly put it outside of some people's price range. The only reason I personally would need a display port cord is if I wanted to use 3 monitors. And if I could afford that, I could afford the $20 for DP. Im pretty sure you need display port for 1440p144hz. But I'm not positive. Edit: Anyone reading this; If I'm wrong about anything, please let me know. I don't want to keep spreading misinformation."}

Well, after 11 years and over 330k combined, organic karma, a cowardly, pathetic and facist minded moderator filed a false harassment report and had my account suspended, after threatening to do so which is a clear violation of the #1 rule of reddit's content policy. However, after filing a ticket before this even happened, my account was permanently banned within 12 hours and the spineless moderator is still allowed to operate in one of the top reddits, after having clearly used intimidation against me to silence someone with a differing opinion on their conflicting, poorly thought out rules. Every appeal method gets nothing but bot replies, zendesk tickets are unanswered for a month, clearly showing that reddit voluntarily supports the facist, cowardly and pathetic abuse of power by moderators, and only enforces the content policy against regular users while allowing the blatant violation of rules by moderators and their sock puppet accounts managing every top sub on the site. Also, due to the rapist mentality of reddit's administration, spez and it's moderators, you can't delete all of your content, if you delete your account, reddit will restore your comments to maintain SEO rankings and earn money from your content without your permission. So, I've used power delete suite to delete everything that I have ever contributed, to say a giant fuck you to reddit, it's moderators, and it's shareholders. From your friends at reddit following every bot message, and an account suspension after over a decade in good standing is a slap in the face and shows how rotten reddit is to the very fucking core."}

At our store you always had to either pre-pay inside or give your card at the pump. The system was set-up that way for a few reasons, one of which being a safety measure for people who may try to pump gas but leave before they paid. Having access inside meant that we could get receipts from earlier in the day as long as we had the card that was used to make the purchase. We could also process the transaction in different ways depending on who we were dealing with. We had contacts with a few local businesses like car dealerships who got a discount on gas because of the sheer volume they got from us. We didn't need to collect money from them if they presented a particular paper. We would keep the paper and get reimbursed later but the pump needs to know the transaction has cleared which is why it needed input from a cashier. Also, if someone came inside to pay with cash the cashier needs to be able to put the funds on that pump. If the guest gave the wrong pump number, the cashier also needs to be able to move the funds to the correct pump. Finally, in case of emergencies, cashiers need to be able to immediately stop all fuel-flow."}

The controller took 56 vdc as input because it used a proprietary version of PoE to power and send data to the sub-controllers behind the individual screens. I believe that Dell and Netgear (maybe others) use HDMI for 10GBE network switches stacking for some of their products so this manufacturer wasn't the first to abuse HDMI connectors and cables for things other than video."}

I went into his office and lo and behold, there is the display that has been discountet for the past 20 Years (He still has it). The price is still from the time we had the \"Deutsche Mark\"/\"German Mark\" as currency here in germany. My father also still has a ton of old cables, which is quite handy when playing around with legacy tech. But he has no VGA Cables left because these are apparently still needed quite often but why would you buy a VGA cable in 2020. (I run mostly on legacy hardware that is still working fine but noone else uses. My PC for example is in a Server Case, connected to the PC there is \\- A 4:3 Monitor that would have cost around 1 000\u20ac when it was new. (It is a fancy monitor with pen support, made for schools) But it sadly only has VGA input (and output, which I mess up every time I reconnect it) \\- Another 4:3 which I originaly got because I wanted a display that supports composite input from my moms old SNES, but now use as a secondary monitor rotated 90\u00b0 (which is a perfect format, because 16:9 displays look so wrong when rotated 90\u00b0, but a 4:3 has similar formats to an A4 sheet of paper) \\- An external IDE hard drive (which I use for backups of some stuff). I just love the sound it makes when it starts spinning. And i use it to charge my fitness band because it only draws like 80mA and it always provides power when plugged in I also have some different stuff like \\- An old ip-telephone, that is still quite good for a telephone but when navigating the menu to fast and doing to much to quick (like importing 200+ contacts) it runs out of memory (8MB) and crashes. But i still love how it starts because you can see all the linux stuff it does and it just looks cool for this brief moment when every single LED is lit. It booting looks cooler than my \\- ISDN telephone. Because my now bedroom was also my dads old office there are cables going throug the wall from that room to mine. I put an old ISDN phone here because having a phone in the bedroom can be quite handy. It must also be more than 20 Years old because it can display the price you will have to pay for your call in D-Mark/Pfennig but not in Euro and (Euro-)cent. \\- a 10/100MB switch. (kinda ancient nowadays, isn't it? \\- an really old office LED-Printer. (I love how it handles a lot of double sided prints at once, and everyone who sees it the first time gets confused. It prints page 1/1 then page 2/1 then page 1/2 and then 2/2, continuing to 3/1 then 4/1........ I don't know if this a common, but I find it very novel. that was a lot of text to type.

In this case the AC is going to be running constantly causing the coils to freeze and floodback that will damage the compressor. The counter to this point is that it's going to constantly be intaking warmer air which might prevent the coils from freezing over, however, moisture capacity increases with temperature so it could exacerbate the coils freezing. To mitigate this problem, OP might want to poke a few holes in the bag by the AC or have a higher setpoint that will still give the AC a break every so often. I'm not sure what the recommended cycle time for mini-splits are, but for central AC you want to have roughly 3 on/off cycles per hour, but that's for optimized efficiency so you can push the limit a little further. At minimum, that thing needs to shutoff at least 1x per hour to prevent it from failing in the short-term."}

The cooling process is caused by the evaporation of a liquid into a gas in the evaporator (the coils). By the time the refrigerant reaches the end of the evaporator, it should be fully in a gaseous state. Since liquids are mostly non-compressible, trying to compress them causes damage to the compressor. The other mechanism of damage is that liquid refrigerant will pump the compressor oil out of the compressor which can cause it to overheat. The compressed gas runs through the condenser which lowers the temperature of the gas causing a phase change back into a liquid. The liquid goes through a narrow orifice called an expansion valve which drops the pressure of the liquid causing it to evaporate (back in the evaporator again). To answer your original question, the off period allows for the high and low side pressures to equalize (which is necessary for certain types of compressors). A cycle timer prevents short cycling, which would be problematic because when starting a vacuum starts to form on the compressor suction line which also can pump oil out of the compressor. The oil returns to the compressor eventually but it's not good to do this frequently."}

No. That\u2019s not gonna help. Thats an old bending issue on A8 Boards where one of the tick frequency/ power saving communication pins on the bga will come off easily because theres only such a thin trace going to it in kind of an unfortunate way. It\u2019s also been an issue with iPhone 6 boards back then. This pin breaks off sooo easily, whether it got bent or dropped. Yea i remember this. Never letting the cpu rest/ changing its tick frequency does sorta fix this, because the device is only going to crash whenever it tries to get the cpu out of power saving again, but can\u2019t do that because the communication through this dataline doesn\u2019t really work."}

The problem is most of the time they are tuned for fuel economy, so you get an engine that doesn't have a high amount of power in the first place, it's\u200b not tuned to rev out quickly, and doesn't shift it just makes a continuous noise which most people don't like or aren't used to, leading them to believe they suck.

If you connect them wrong, there is an electrical change in the circuit. If the circuit isn't designed properly, from an engineering perspective, that change can damage parts of the circuits. The \"right\" way to engineer it is to reduce the overall power to safe levels, which also coincidentally and counterintuitively can make the range at which it can communicate *better*. The reasons for the improvement has to do with handshakes between other devices of that sort. Essentially, with more power applied, the radio is too busy dealing with a shitload of other handshakes that you don't care about to get around to your own devices in a timely manner. That frequently causes those other devices to time out. That's a wild oversimplification, mind you, but it's why the advice for \"I can't connect\" is not just \"set the radio to plaid\". The radio space is highly congested and that actually results in worse experiences for *everyone*. Edited a typo and cleaned up a sentence fragment I left in while editing it to be a little simpler at first. Edit 2: When I say the radio space is congested, I mean in crowded environments. This is most common in cities, especially with multifamily structures around. It can definitely apply in places with a lot of electronics devices all doing their best to connect, though, which is why public events in remote places, such as Burning Man, can have similar problems."}

But the ground is for shielding it from interference. Sinking and emf that hits it into the ground instead it causing noise on the line. Thus allowing faster connections without the system getting confused with what is legitimate communication vs garbage noise. Grounding it is perfectly safe though. And probably works better for killing the interference as it'd be sinking all of the energy into the ground. And the ground on both antennas is probably shared just behind a diode. But yeah. No harm done, and you can't know what isn't explained either. I'd say the chances of causing damage is extremely low anyways. The fact that it has two screw lugs that are the same size implies the device figures out which antenna is which when screwed in through measuring the resistance. And because it does that it also wouldn't need any additional hardware to figure out that pumping power into it would kill something."}

Now lookint at the charger, some Apple chargers have that round metal part, connected to ground, others have that part made in plastic.

Enough to spout nonsense you know nothing about, and called the bluff of the wrong person. The $1 cable I referred to is one I've bought many of, of various lengths, as I don't like messy cables. It's a C7, or C7P plug, and it, like C5 cables plugs, and virtually all other US lamps, largely use the same wire. So much so, it's called \"lamp wire\". It's a pair of 18awg cable. Now this is the part where your little indignance breaks down, and it's gonna involve numbers that aren't money, so stay with me. 18awg cable is capable of running 10 amps over 120v power, so long as it isn't over 50 feet. The Apple cable is required to provide enough to supply a Macbook with, at most, 85 watts of power. Watts are calculated by multiplying voltage by amperage. So the Apple cable is required to supply 85. My $1 cable you doubt so much is capable of supplying 1200. Truth be told, the Apple cable is likely 18 as well, possibly 20awg, since they like making money. But at this point it's pretty clear you don't know what you're talking about, but are heavily, emotionally invested in your opinion, and may want to rethink your opinions on Apple and your discretionary income choices. >Probably because quality and safety cost money, hence the USB power supplies from reputable brands, that won't burn your house down, aren't $1 from eBay. As I've shown above: No. It's just cuz Apple likes overcharging people, and people who like Apple appear to like getting overcharged, then get very defensive when it's pointed out. I take safety very seriously--more so than I care to explain right now, [and far more than you'd likely believe.]( The $1 cables aren't from Ebay, but they also weren't USB cables. Please try to follow along. USB has become a very convoluted standard that requires a great deal of research to ensure you're getting what you need. There are some dangerous cables out there, so you need to be aware of what you're getting. They're going to cost more than $1, but a 6ft cable isn't $30. That's just you buying an Apple executive another vacation home. >You won't be buying the stand unless you're buying the monitor. > >This isn't for your \"gaming rig\", it's for people that have the budgets to pay for it, where time is money, and don't want to waste time finding a cheaper alternative. *<googles \"VESA compliant monitor mount\">* Oh look. I found [a cheaper alternative]( It only took me *<looks at non-existent watch>* 10 seconds. At $970 savings, I'm saving almost $350,000 an hour! Boy, that certainly isn't worth \"wasting time to find a cheaper alternative.\" Yeah, if I'm a business with a budget, it's certainly much better to just spend an extra $1,000 for *every single* one of these monitors we buy. That money clearly couldn't be better spent somewhere else. But wait! There's more! True to Apple's philosophy of proprietary bullshit I explained earlier, they've made certain their monitor **is not VESA compliant**. Why, you ask? I'll tell you! This way if people come to their senses (as many have over this) and decide they don't want to pay Apple $1,000 for a ridiculously overpriced stand, they'll instead still be forced to pay Apple $200 for the *adapter* to that makes the monitor VESA compliant! Either way you go, Apple screws you over! :D Noticing a pattern? Oh, and their justification for this bullshit? It pivots between landscape and portrait, and has a magnet so you can disconnect it and take it with you. Now, the $30 option I showed also spins 360 degrees, so I guess they had to up their game to justify this nonsense by adding another feature that seems more like a solution looking for a problem than an innovation. I don't know why anyone needs to quickly disconnect and travel with a monitor that's the size of a small TV--it's not exactly convenient to transport something like that, but I give them points for the sheer audacity of suggesting this level of shit to justify another \"innovation\" they could use to rip people off even more. Bonus: If they encourage people to carry around a $5,000 monitor, there's a chance it'll get as destroyed just like an iPhone, requiring them to buy another! Again, noticing a pattern? Give if a month or so. Someone'll sell a better version of their VESA mount adapter for $50 on Amazon. >By whinging about the cost of something you aren't required to buy. You don't even need to buy it even to use that monitor, you could of course find your own stand if you're willing to put in the time. Ah, apparently you weren't aware of the $200 Sucker Tax. :) Yeah, the whole \"Oh, but you're not required to buy it! We're doing you a favor!\" line falls apart when everyone just realizes even Apple didn't think they could get away with charging an extra $1000 for the monitor by forcing people to buy the stand as well. That make it nearly double the cost of Dell's version, and they wanted to stay under Eizo and Sony. So, instead, it's a $5200 monitor, minimum. They're just milking the intended demographic, hoping they'll shell out more for overpriced nonsense because they're settling for the Apple XDR instead of getting a far more expensive reference monitor, but anyone in that same market is also going to look at others making similar products, so they still have to stay competitive. Brass tacks? You're the one who mentioned the monitor--I don't care about it. I said the stand is bullshit, because the ability to pivot, rotate and \"easily disconnect\" a 32\" display does not justify a $1000 cost. Nor does a simple adapter for VESA compliance justify a $200 cost. >I say this as someone who literally yesterday had to spend time filing down my new \"VESA desk mount\" to fit my expensive monitor I'm hoping you're not saying it would be wiser to spend 1,000 USD than to spend a few minutes filing down a monitor mount. I'll stick with my middle-ground of buying VESA mounts that meet the typical 75 or 100mm standard, as I've never had any issues with them. It sounds like you got a low quality VESA mount, but the wonderful thing about standards is that you can measure both the monitor and the mount, and see who actually screwed up!"}

I realize you're trying to be clever, but I'm not sure you understand how much what you just said backfired. I called it \"overpriced Unix\" to highlight the irony of a free operating system contrasted with such overpriced *hardware*. Frankly, calling it Unix was a compliment. If you weren't aware, MacOS is based off BSD. That's not free, but alternatives exist that are, the OS X might as well be at this point. (That's quite possibly the only place Apple doesn't gouge its customers, probably because you can't wear it or set it on your desk as an overpriced status symbol. They know their demographic, I'll give them that.) That said, I'm not sure where you're going asking about whether or not either of the two operating systems you mentioned--that I didn't--will run a video editing program or an image editing program. Whether or not a program will run on an OS is dependant upon the program, not the OS. That's why it's called \"Operating System *Requirements*\". It's a restriction of the program. If the developers of said program didn't bother programming it to run on said operating systems, it doesn't. That said, thanks for pointing out another example of Apple being proprietary: Apple makes Final Cut Pro X. Therefore they'll only let you use it if you're running their OS. They won't write support for other operating systems. That's not Microsoft's fault, nor any version of any other operating system in existence. If anything, I'd make sure any application I was dead-set on using supported multiple operating systems so I didn't get forced into a single one. Then again, getting stuck with no options and being forced to pay out the nose as a result seems to be the MO of Apple customers. :) Fortunately, Adobe's Premiere Pro runs on both Windows or Mac, and is arguably the better software, with a greater market share following FCP's debacle in 2011. I like how you picked FCPX as an example to try to shoulder out the Windows option, though. :) I like how you picked a tiny and lightweight version of linux for an example. Why not CentOS, RHEL, SuSE or Ubuntu? Worried Adobe might support those? So I will tell you...Photoshop will run on Arch Linux. :) Arch Linux supports Wine, which will indeed run some versions of Photoshop, and other Adobe products. I'm not sure what you intended to prove by asking that, but I'd suggest ensuring you actually know the answer to questions you ask in the future when you believe them sardonic and rhetorical. Don't assume others are platform zealots--you're projecting. >You sound like the kind of weird Linux zealot that I once was. Do you go around with an FSF sticker on your 10 year old Thinkpad? [Not exactly]( The Thinkpads were certainly tough, especially before they went Lenovo, but I've come to find I prefer my hardware to be a bit more durable. I'm not really the subject matter here, but since you asked: I'm platform agnostic. I've never been a zealot of any hardware or software--they're all tools used to accomplish various goals, so you use the best one for the job. If quality declines from one platform, developer or manufacturer, you find the one who is better for the right price. If Apple changed its ways I'd use them. I'm IT, not a consumer. I've been the administrator of multiple datacenter locations for a global company. I've been a sysadmin for RHEL/CentOS, SLES, ESX, Solaris, every version of WinServer, and likely others I'm forgetting. I know the pros and cons of them all, and use whichever makes the most sense. I don't use Apple products because they're overpriced and there's an alternative for anything exclusive to them on MS or NIX OS. Hardware? I've worked on workstations. I've worked on Apple devices. I've worked on servers. So many damn servers. I've had to work on hardware that costs more than my house and solve problems so complicated I don't even want to think about them. And in doing all that for years, you learn a lot about how to keep a company running. About what works, what doesn't, and what causes needless problems that will complicate matters, slow things down and cost you time and money. What works is standardization on hardware and software using non-proprietary specifications to facilitate scalability, monitoring, efficient diagnosis & repair in an enterprise environment. What doesn't work is buying overpriced hardware that doesn't conform to international standards, sinking all that money into something, getting stuck with it, and having it screw you over later because the design makes it difficult and/or costly to repair, upgrade, or modify in the future. The same applies to software. Marketing and sales need the snazzy looking hardware, but that doesn't mean it has to be from Apple to impress clients. You don't use a screwdriver to hammer a nail. Every device should have a purpose. Every problem or challenge has multiple solutions. It's our job to determine the best one for the task using an unbiased opinion by factoring in everything I've mentioned, especially ROI of both time and money. Apple is relegated largely to the cellphone and artist workstation markets because those are the only markets in which it can thrive. It's appeal is on being edgy. \"Look at me! I'm not a PC!\" It's developed itself into a quasi-religion, deriving loyalty from its customers through pathos more than logos. It wouldn't be where it was if it wasn't white, rounded, and hid all its screws. But there's a reason you can't make backups from your Apple workstation to your Apple rackmount server anymore. Superfluous features like magnetic monitors or difficult to repair designs don't cut it in markets such as server datacenters, where sales of hardware racks costing millions of dollars to companies who provide solutions, not gimmicks."}

As someone in a position of power I would NEVER do this. I can understand analyzing a pure overhead department and considering them not fiscally viable but all that should stay behind closed door meetings, and if the department is voted to get cut it gets cut and the employees get notices/severances etc.. it sucks.. it happens but its better that way (Band-Aid). You should never lord that over the people in that department and make them go through constant torment.. Its not like you can magically make your department a profit center.. I'm glad you moved away from that environment. . . > Especially being able to justify my work much easier now! I hate that you have in the fear in the back of your mind that you have to justify your work from the trauma of your previous work environment.. Trust me when I say an employer notices hard work dedication and devotion and they are justification enough. Oh course you need the skill as well but a hardworking dedicated mindset will take you along way. . . > Hope you're staying safe and works been going well. I can only imagine how much network infrastructure/security has changed with WFH. You as well bud! I've been taking the pandemic pretty serious and started my families quarantine in early March and we're still going strong. It helps that that both my wife and I are introverts lol. As per work luckily we've not been negatively affected. This will actually be one of our best years on the books. I've been able to keep all of our staff and clients through all of this and turn a profit. During February and March I highly advised all of our clients to prep WFH plans and worked with them to build out those plans and invest in the infrastructure if it was not there. We reviewed all of our clients infrastructure for mobile VPN access and configured all that did not have it and just left it disabled so we could toggle it on when needed. It saved us countless hours when all the lockdowns hit. We also created clean up scripts and SOPs for BYOD WFH setups so that any device client owned or other wise that went home with an employee / was used was documented / cleansed / setup properly and signed off on. We performed a lot of Win7 to 10 upgrades on client employee devices pre-lockdown.. I had to instruct some HIPAA clients to disable certain features on their Alexa.. All kinds of stuff man lol There are numerous other things we did from there to prep them but this is running kind of long already so I'll just say we had everything on lock!! The WFH era is defiantly a unique time / experience in our line of work but I honestly think this time has shown business' its a viable model. We have numerous clients closing down offices permanently because they work just as efficient in a WFH setting and its saves money. Not every business can do this but it works great for some! (Also fun fact if you WFH and do itemized taxes there are a TON of write offs you can do!) Wow sorry for writing you a book!! I just got in the zone and kept typing... anyway have a great rest of your day man and best of luck on your OSCP exam!"}

When you plug the laptop in, it could pull nothing (off, full battery), or the full 100 watts if it needs to (low battery, under load), or anywhere in between. A battery is the same: It supplies power at some voltage (albeit a voltage that drops somewhat as its discharged), and can supply some maximum amount of power. For a drill battery like this, the peak power capability is probably actually several hundred watts, easily enough to power a laptop."}

Electrochemistry isn't my specialty so I may be fuzzy on some of the details. Basically rechargeable batteries work on the principle that the reaction is reversible. When you discharge the battery, the reaction goes one way. When you charge it, the reaction goes the opposite way. When Li-ion batteries drop below a certain voltage, an irreversible reaction takes place. IIRC, that's production of Li2O. With all of that Li^+ removed from the battery's normal reaction and locked up in Li2O, the battery becomes weaker until it can't function at all. I *think* this could lead to overcharging the battery much earlier than the protection circuit is designed for when recharging it and can lead to a fire. EDIT: Clarity"}

(Gallons Per Foot or Liters per Meters. Garden Hose versus a straw.) Similarly thickness of a wire is related to how many Amps the wire can supply. A thicker wire can supply more amps than a thin wire because it has more space for energy to move. If you put a lot of water (amps) from a large pipe (wire) to a small pipe(wire) and the amount is too much for the small pipe (wire) to handle, then the pipe will burst (burn/catch fire). So if you need a lot of water(energy) at the end destination but don't want to use a big pipe (wire), what do you do? You increase the speed of the water (energy) moving through the wire. The Speed of the water moving through the pipe is the Voltage (Meters/Feet per Minute that water moves, or water pressure). Too much speed (voltage) can be damaging, for instance if you are watering plants too high a pressure can rip them apart (destroy the electronics), too low and you can't water the plants effectively (the electronics don't work) This is also why the power lines aren't enormously thick wires despite needing to power cities. They are very high voltage (speed) to supply the same amount of overall energy (Watts) at the building level even though they have a small pipe. Once it's at a building they \"slow\" the speed down to safe level for electronics. Watts would be how much water goes through the pipe at one time so Gallons Per Minute (Or Liters Per Minute). Speed \u00d7 Diameter = Gal/Liter Per Hour So: Voltage \u00d7 Amps = Watts. 1V \u00d7 60A = 60W 30V \u00d7 2A = 60W 12V \u00d7 5A = 60W The overall power usage over time is the same despite the \"speed\" and the \"amount of energy in the wire at one time\" differing in those three equations."}

In the past, most power supplies were of the \"linear\" type, which means there was a transistor in there somewhere connected with a feedback circuit to act as a voltage regulator. The transistor's conductance is varied throughout a range to affect how much of the input ends up in the output, so there's a \"linear\" relationship between the control element and the control function. Feeding it was a transformer (producing a fixed ratio from line voltage) and rectifier (turning the line's AC into DC). A linear regulator turns its excess power into heat. So the line voltage had to match the design expectations pretty closely -- too high and the regulator would burn up, too low and the output voltage would sag below its ability to regulate. Devices like this often had switches on the back, or a fancy little fuse-holder where you could insert the fuse a few different ways, to pick between 110V, 115V, 120V, 220V, 230V, 240V. Some had even finer steps! In the last twenty years or so, the more sophisticated type of regulator got affordable. This is called a \"switch-mode\" power supply (SMPS), and the name has nothing to do with a user-facing power switch, it refers to a transistor inside that's either fully on or fully off at any given moment, so it's behaving like a switch, and in either of those states, it dissipates very little heat. A control chip is bashing it between those states several hundred, perhaps several thousand times per second, to keep the output voltage at its regulated level. The \"duty cycle\", the ratio of on-time to off-time, controls the output. And it can be varied over a huge range, so the input voltage can vary over a huge range while keeping a stable output. SMPS generally produce about the same amount of waste heat (very little) regardless of the ratio of input voltage to output voltage, and these two attributes -- high efficiency and wide line voltage regulation -- make them very desirable. (They have some nonideal aspects, like electrical interference/noise, but we've also gotten better at handling that.) Devices with SMPS often have an incredibly wide voltage range -- look at your laptop brick for instance, the input voltage range is probably something like 100-250V AC. Anywhere within there and it'll be happy. Linear power supplies are easy to identify -- they have a substantial transformer, which is mostly iron and copper, and they're just super heavy for their size. Also nearly cubical, because the transformer is shaped that way. Old wall-warts that feel like they're made of iron inside, yup, they are! By contrast, SMPS tend to be quite lightweight; feel any cellphone charger or random router power-supply today, and it's like the thing is two-thirds air inside. Yup, it is! There's a circuit board in there with some fairly small components on it. And the package is often flatter in one dimension, reflecting the flat board inside. Inside devices themselves, it varies quite a bit: Many wifi routers and laptops and stuff have a few more SMPS inside that handle the output from the brick and produce the various voltages needed by the different circuits inside. (The brick is mostly there to keep mains voltage away from the device, so only the brick has to be safety-certified to work with mains, and there's one per country for different mains standards and regulatory bodies. The device itself is handling only lower and safer voltages, and can be paired with any country-specific brick.) So in the case of my favorite router, the venerable WRT54G, the brick is nominally 12V, but the router is quite happy with anything between about 6 and 15. I've run them directly from 12V batteries, which sit at about 14V while charging, and sag to 11 or so at the end of discharge. Likewise laptops, which may be rated at 19v or 20v or 21v, these all mean the same thing in practice, and they can all run safely from a brick anywhere in that range. The different labels are mostly there to scare consumers into buying the name-brand brick instead of a generic 20V. But a lot of USB-powered devices, for instance, really need 5V in. They can run down to maybe 4 in some cases, but not much higher; their internal regulators (almost always producing 3.3v for the internal circuits) really expect 4-5v input, and will smoke above 7. Don't run a USB device directly from a car battery -- put a lighter-socket car charger in between to convert the 12 to 5! This is how my present-day router in the basement runs on battery. I have a \"12v\" battery charger constantly keeping the battery up at 14-ish, and then a lighter-socket hanging off it with a USB adapter plugged into it, and then my little USB-powered router runs from that. It's cheaper than a storebought UPS, and way more fun! ;)"}

Even with PSUs without CC mode, just select a charging voltage that will cause the battery to draw 0.5C and just leave it at that.

In 2nd grade we were having story time, we stayed at our community tables for this while the teacher read instead of the reading circle on the rug. (I think we had a substitute teacher) In the middle of this table there were little flower pots filled with uncooked kidney beans and pens that were wrapped in a green floral tape with flowers on the end to make the pens appear as flowers. While I always enjoyed the stories that the teacher read for some reason I was completely bored during this one. This prompted me to play with the kidney beans to alleviate some boredom. In this boredom I decided to see what these beans sounded like an inserted one into my ear. It fell deep into my ear. The bean went into my ear canal and stayed there. I of course wasn't able to fit a finger in to scoop it out. I panicked. Out of fear of the consequences I refused to tell the teacher and instead raised my hand to be excused to the restroom. In the restroom true panic set in, this bean was going to stay in my ear for the rest of my life if I didn't do something so for the next 30 to 45 mins I stayed in the restroom doing everything I could to remove the bean from my ear. I put water in my ear, I shook my head parallel to the ground and I plugged my nose and blew as hard as I could. This seemed to help. So I combined the water and the Valsalva maneuver and the bean slowly worked it's way out stopping just on the cusp of my ear hole. I blew once more and the bean shot out of my ear and went flying across the restroom. I walked back to the classroom expecting to be chastised for my long bathroom break, but the teacher said nothing. I had escaped the consequences of my actions and the wrath of my single mother who worked full time and certainly didn't have time for my bullshit. Anyway...all this to say ain't no way I'm putting a pistachio shell in my ear."}

As an electrical engineer, I want to know what happened when the platter motor had an unexpected (to the servo drive) load and teh spindle speed dropped. HDD's don't like that, and even if you used an old drive with no energy-saving or no-data spindle motor cut-out, the servo drive would shut down if the spindle speed dropped below its rated speed. They do this because they're programmed to assume that if spindle speed drops, there must be mechanical damage, and continuing to spin would cause more damage."}

Because cold chisels are used to form metal, they have a less-acute angle to the sharp portion of the blade than a woodworking chisel. This gives the cutting edge greater strength at the expense of sharpness. >Cold chisels come in a variety of sizes, from fine engraving tools that are tapped with very light hammers, to massive tools that are driven with sledgehammers. Cold chisels are forged to shape and hardened and tempered (to a blue colour) at the cutting edge."}

Look up the pinout (it's basically 3 grounds and 2 differential data pairs), snip one connector off the cable, strip that end, check and note the order the different conductors at the stripped end using a continuity tester, measuring between one conductor and the intact connector's pins on the other end of the cable. Now that you have identified the conductors, identify the order of the pins on the drive itself, you don't want to end up soldering it upside down. Then it's just some careful soldering. I found it a bit easier with every 2nd pin bent upward, but just do it to taste. 3 of the 7 pins are interconnected grounds, and it may be enough to only connect one of them. With 2 done it works perfectly and I suspect 1 would be just as good. After testing (R/W) and confirming that it's indeed alive, you can add a blob of hot glue to fix the whole assembly in place and add some zipties to keep mechanical stress from the joint. This method doesn't guarantee longevity but I suppose that unless the whole thing and solder joints are subjected to excessive vibration/mechanical forces, it'll stay fixed for quite some time"}

Air vs Subzero", "content": "I wanted to see if extreme overclocking actually gives more FPS than just a regular air OC, if you push both the CPU and GPU together, not just one. I tested a 3060 Ti and 9700K, as I think they are a pretty even and common match. Stock, Air OC, and Subzero OC (glycol coolant -18C). Games tested were SOTTR, Cyberpunk 2077, Horizon Zero Dawn, Red Dead 2 all at 1440p. SOTTR 95-106-111 Cyberpunk 61-69-72 HZD 66-76-79 RDR2 81-84-91 Some games scaled a bit, some not so much. So, full system overclocking can help. But it really depends on the game, and you need the thermals to actually hold the higher clocks. Subzero didn\u2019t just extend the gains, it opened up more scaling where air had already maxed out. There are a lot of variables here, and that's why I didn't do CPU and GPU one at a time, partly because I don't have a spare 1268 hours, but the point was to see if full system OC made a meaningful difference, and if going subzero improved on that. This was all done with the GPU on stock BIOS with no voltage mods. The card I was using turned out to be a bit of a dud, and I think I will have to try this test again with a different card. Not sure if I should use a lower tier card with higher headroom or a mid to high one. Anyway, documented it all if you want to check out the graphs and results. ["}

The power cord is connected to the splitter with light bulb sockets. It does the degaussing just fine, images 2 and 3 are before and after.

Never got a thank you or anything for it, decades later still get treated like I can either solve impossible tasks dropped in my lap or cant do a damn thing, nothing in between.... The moral of the story: you can grab a small magnet and 'comb' out the remaining discoloration. Is there no degaussing option in the menus? It looks like a computer monitor, they usually have an option to trigger the internal degaussing circuit. You might need to get into some sort of service mode if its not in the normal menus. Of course, with a heavy stain like the first image the built in degausser might not had done it, the second one though....then again, built in degausser wouldnt have gotten you that sweet sweet post karma"}

I believe the backlight on the LCD is known to fade and eventually die, so I'm guessing there might be some popular mods documented somewhere that are very similar to OP's attempt, but with closer matching (voltage/size/brightness) LEDs. Hopefully, OP gets at least another decade of use out of it!"}

Initially I wanted to build my own backlight by trimming down the backlight of a broken laptop screen I had laying around. I totally failed though. The way the LEDs on the laptop backlight were wired wasn't suitable for trimming down and I broke a couple of them even just trying to get it out of the frame. But yeah, these samplers are pretty cool. I got an external SCSI CD-ROM drive hooked up to it (that's also quite the macgyver contraption due to working external SCSI drives being quite expensive). I typically use it to dig through old sample CDs from the 90s. Those things often have some good stuff on there."}

I would say that nowadays in densely populated areas, it's probably the better choice. If you don't have any issues with your internet speed and responsiveness, it might not make much of a difference to you personally - the main difference in that case would just be bandwidth. If you live somewhere that's densely populated, though, it's very likely to be better than 2.4 Ghz in both overall responsiveness and speed. The unlicensed 2.4Ghz RF spectrum band is very crowded, not just from Wi-Fi, but from things like Bluetooth, Zigbee and other smart home wireless protocols, proprietary 2.4Ghz wireless keyboards, mice and controllers, and a whole host of other things that use that particular radio frequency band. If interference from the people around you isn't much of an issue where you live, 2.4Ghz might have longer range, because the longer wavelength makes it better at going long-rage and through obstacles. But if your area is crowded with 2.4Ghz devices, you may not be able to even see that theoretical benefit."}

Stopped by both Best Buy and the local hypermart on my way, and neither had the right cable for sale, all they had were C13s and C5s (Mickey Mouse). However, the hypermart had extension cords, and I had a few Apple charging bricks with the \u201cduck end\u201d connectors, which are C7s. So I grabbed an extension cable, and tried it. After modifying the plastic around the end of the extension cord, it connected to the duck end and into the Mini, and worked great.

You'd think they'd consult their 30+ year old tech nerd child on Internet needs but no the electrician said it was fine he could do it and that's what he did. Well the pitiful length meant I had to put my PC at a half height on a separate little table because it wouldn't reach much above ground and one time I tried to move my PC slightly forwards to plug something in and gently pulled on my Ethernet port.

Stock for stock, the 3060 Ti is the stronger card, so I wanted to see how close I could get by overclocking the 5050 as far as it would go. In question was a Zotac gaming twin edge 3060Ti and a Gigabyte Windforce OC 5050. I started with a ducted esky. Didn\u2019t work. Then I dropped the GPU cooler into a glycol ice bath, looked awesome but still wasn\u2019t enough under load. (In hindsight, it may have been a contact issue not a cooling issue) Finally, I ducted a portable air conditioner into the cooler, and that setup actually kept temps low enough to hold an OC without throttling. Stock, the 5050 sat around 2800 MHz. With the AC setup I pushed it to 3315 MHz about an 18% clock speed uplift, which translated into roughly a 14% FPS gain across the games I tested. At stock, the 5050 was about 17\u201320% behind the 3060 Ti. After the overclock, that gap closed to around 3% on average, and in more than half the games, the 5050 actually won. All testing was 1440p native, DX12, no DLSS or FSR. CPU was a 12600KF at 5.3 GHz with the e\u2011cores off, 32 GB DDR4\u20113200 CL16, and the same Nvidia driver for both cards.

Many years ago I installed networks in schools and had two methods of running plenum rated Cat5 cables. The simple method was a softball with a metal eyelet screwed into it. Tie the cable to the ball and toss it to another spot in the ceiling. That worked OK for most suspended ceilings when there was enough space. Later a friend loaned me a 4WD RC truck. I could attach the cable and run that thing around pipes, ductwork and over lighting fixtures. Made a hell of a racket but cut the time down when running cables."}

Another option, if the only issue is the internal clips don't clip anymore (sounds like the real issue, worn out clips inside the female side) would be disassembly of that side instead. Look at your plug in hand. Each black strip separates the \"pins\". The female side has metal strips bent specifically to hold the plug in place, AND transmit audio/mic. From misuse and misalignment, those strips have bent *away* from where they should be. One day real soon, nothing will work. You need to fix the other side, not the headphones themselves."}

That would be helpful when you are about to screw it into the cap so you can visually verify that the wires are in the middle and in the correct place so it gets fully crimped. The little tools you made are very helpful too, but I did have to finish threading it in with pliers as you can only go so far with the tool clamped onto the threads it seemed like. Not sure if you can do anything to get around that really. But overall I love this design.

I bought it used about a year ago to use as a media tablet and to experiment on. Let's go over some of the upgrades. Adventures in power levels. The N5000 is based on Atom architecture. While the TDP of the processor is about 6w, you can disable core and memory isolation and use RWeverything to disabled power limits. Here is you can see the package can get up to 15w with the cores themselves past 10w. This also allows a clock boost to 3.850GHz, WAY up from the 2.7 GHz peak. The only down side is that this is a passive cooled design and gets to a toasty 103' before backing off. This was one of the last Pentium series laptops to support removable RAM. It can actually take a 16GB DDR4 stick! It came with 4GB. The official wifi was a single antenna Wi-Fi 6. This was replaced with an Intel AX210. I tried an Intel BE200, but it would not boot. Still, this will get gigabit speeds on my home network. I may try the Qualcomm Wifi7 solution as the Realtek does not support 320MHz channel width. SSD was upgraded to 240GB. None of this impacts battery life, and will run 8-10 hours watching Netflix. Eventually, I would like to cut down the size of the SSD housing and add a fan to move air inside. I need to figure out how to do that only when plugged in."}

Those wire gauges on his treadmill appear to be too large for several of the JST and Molex style connectors I used in the past. I'm sure some exist, but not what I would have thought of first. Thanks for the link though, that's a good resource. My experience is from industrial automation., so I recommend what I know. You may not like the look of it but M12 connectors bridge power and connect signals in almost every machine and conveyor system in the world. It's much easier to terminate than you'd think and only requires a wire stripper and a screwdriver. Some even use IDC terminations which technically don't require either. No special JST or Molex tools required. There's a reason they're widely used in industrial systems. The M12 solution is IP67 rated maybe IP68 and with a voltage insulation rating typically at or above 300V, and as far as I knew a JST is not. They're perfectly good when inside another housing, but not appropriate for full exposure to direct contact. The M12 solution I mentioned would be a bit pricey and overkill at about $60, so I offered an affordable alternative at about $20 plus shipping with loads of spare parts, and again only requires a stripper (with an insulated terminal crimper in the jaws common on most strippers) and a screwdriver. I believe the bullet terminals would be about the same as a JST or Molex connector in terms of IP rating and typical voltage insulation. Without knowing exactly what's being transmitted over those wires I cannot say with certainty if either of our solutions are ideal."}

You're worried about what voltages the wires are carrying, but recommend bullet connectors? Nuh uh...I don't think so. That's a great way to end up with a user error causing a dangerous scenario or damaging the equipment. Could even end up with electrocution or fire. They're one of my least favorite connectors. Forget JST if you're worried about voltage/current capacity then. There are Molex and DuPont connectors that are rated for 600V and 14AWG wire. Crimpers for them aren't special or difficult to find anymore. $20-$30 will get you a pair of crimpers that will last a lifetime of hobbyists use."}

The CH341A is slow but it's inexpensive and it DOES work. There are faster programmers out there but they are MUCH more expensive. If you do BIOS flashing at the hardware level once or twice a year, this is a good investment for very little money. If you do hardware flashing a lot more than twice per year, you may want to invest in a better programmer. This is the older version and it comes with a good selection of accessories. Get the Programmer kit1 version as you get more SOP8 / 16 sockets. Aliexpress has a wide selection of sockets and temporary solder boards that will work with this programmer you can buy for very little money. There is a design flaw in this version where it applies the wrong voltage to the chip, some chips blow, some chips survive. This kit comes with the 1.8v adapter included. There is a hack out there you can google for the plans but it means lifting one of the CH341A pins off the pad without snapping it off and soldering a small wire to it and routing power from the voltage regulator to that pin. Two other wires also need to be soldered on elsewhere to complete the hack. Very delicate work but it can be done. Some people hate the chip clip because they say \"It snaps off while I was using it\", they work fine if you hold it in place while in use. [Blue Tak]( works great for that provided you don't move anything while it's reading or writing. I also use Blue Tak for holding some through hole parts in place while soldering them. There is a newer version of this programmer that integrates a voltage selector switch in the design which fixes the original flaw. Look for Version 1.7. It can also program a wider selection of EEPROMS but they typically come with fewer accessories. On Aliexpress, the 1st through the 5th of each month is the Choice sale week where items that have Choice shipping go on sale with some pretty good discounts for 5 days. That sale starts in less than 12 hours. Naturally, you're going to need software to run these. Virus Total states it's clean but do your own deeper scanning, best practice would be to run it in a VM or on a dedicated e-waste computer that only does this one job, NOT connected to your network just to be safe. Sneakernet in the .bin files for burning on an SD card with the switch in read only mode just to be extra paranoid safe.

It had a 2500K and a Gigabyte P67 motherboard which for me was a jackpot because in 2018 it was still a pretty good CPU especially when overclocked (iirc it rivaled stock Skylake/Kaby Lake i5s) plus the correct motherboard for overclocking. I brought it home to test, but I kept getting POST issues. Tried to force it to go to the backup BIOS, no luck. Flashed both BIOSes, no luck. Once in like 20 power-cycle resets it would boot to the operating system, but once I power it down, it wouldn't pass POST again. Back then I didn't know much about PC repair and hardware debugging so I couldn't pinpoint the problem down to either CPU or motherboard, which forced me to just use an i3-540 (OC'd to 4.2GHz) and an H55 mobo from the same salvage pile and leave the Sandy Bridge combo. A year later I revisited the problematic parts. It... booted? First try? And it kept booting, even through power cycles. So I decided to try the 2500K out until it eventually wouldn't boot again and gave it 4.4GHz. That worked for like a week, after which I without hesitation went back to the H55 and bought an Xeon X3440 and pushed it to 3.5GHz and used it for the next year until I moved to the States. Now that I think about it, it's probably some kind of IC defect I wouldn't easily be able to diagnose even now as a computer/firmware engineer. If I had more electrical knowledge and debugging tools, maybe, but definitely not worth my time. Idk why I just wrote all of this, I should get to writing the report I've been putting off for a week."}

So I grabbed 8 litres of fresh ATF, dumped it into a plastic tub, and sunk a GTX 1080 Ti straight in. The oil loop just sat there with a little submersible pump to stir it around, and an external pump to help overcome the thickness of the cold oil, while a second loop pumped -18C glycol all through a Dodge Journey transmission cooler. Two separate loops, zero mixing, maximum fear. The 1080 Ti held around 1960 MHz on air, and after the oil bath I pushed it to 2114 MHz That gave me about 7% more FPS across the board, not bad, but it\u2019s already a power hungry card so there wasn\u2019t much headroom to begin with. Then I plopped in a GTX 1060, and that\u2019s when things got fun, and messy. Stock it sat at 1886 MHz. In oil it pushed to 2190 MHz. That\u2019s a 16% clock boost, and the FPS gains matched +10 FPS in every game, +16% in 3DMark. The lower baseline made the uplift look huge, and honestly the little guy kind of stole the show. 1080Ti didn't achieve much, this is oil after all not LN2, but the 1060 got 2 place overall in Timespy and 1st place overall in Firestrike. (only using the 14900k shhhh) Also, ATF is fun. It crawls into every crevice, stains your cables, and turns teardown into a full day regret spiral. Don\u2019t try this unless you\u2019re okay with ruining hardware and your mood. Anyway, two cards, same test bench, no mods, just oil. 1080 Ti gained 7%, 1060 gained 16%. All with a tub of transmission fluid and some dumb ideas. Thanks Dodge! Games tested Sottr Farcry6 Hitman 3 Firestrike and Timespy Video is here if you want to see the mess. ["}

So here goes. I picked up an old PowerEdge 2900 (yes, I know: e-waste. But, I have a plan). I actually REALLY like the toaster (the hot swap drives) and to be honest I picked up an open-air case that uses a total of 0 (zero) disk drives, so I need something that will do the job. I stripped this PowerEdge with the idea that I might remove the cage and maybe get the disk slots, but alas: it's part of the skeleton! Now here lies my REAL problem: I threw away all of the \"computer\" side of the server, meaning I kept the backplane, and all of the wires, but the motherboard? Power supplies? Fans? Heat sinks? All gone to the trash weeks ago. But I still have the front cover and the side panels. So I'm thinking there are two *simple*[-r than most other] plans I can follow. Either way, I have no idea how I'm going to wire it into my system, and no idea what direction to go for how to figure it out. Plan #1: cut the skeleton. Chop off the excess \"computer\" side, leaving the front cage and just do some *fancy handiwork on the panels to get them to fit, as most of them are screwed on anyways. Plan #2: remodel it. Leave everything in the case, but cut the back interface panel off in order to mount a standard motherboard (I do have a scrap computer I can use) instead of the BTX bologna it came with (i.e. why it went to the trash) Any information helps, if I need to post this somewhere else I think I saw some places tagged that I will look at when I'm able."}
