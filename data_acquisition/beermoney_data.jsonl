In that individual app's settings, go to permissions. 4. Select location to change the app's location permissions. 5. Select \"Allow only while using the app.\" 6. Now go to Settings, Google Settings and find \"Ads\". h7. Make sure that ad personalization is allowed. It probably will say \"opt out of ad personalization\" with a toggle switch.

I made the mistake of thinking they would still be a reliable option and did another study with them 2 months ago, and still haven't gotten my incentive payment. Over these 2 months of waiting, they've locked my account 3 times for stupid reasons like misreading my ID and accidentally marking it as invalid. Just today, they unlocked my account and then locked it again after a few hours. Customer service is nonexistent-- if you email them, you'll be lucky to receive a response. Their phone number is useless; if you call it, it just plays a message telling you to email them and then disconnects. No doubt they've had to remove their customer service line due to the sheer amount of people they've pissed off. I've had some luck with calling the corporate number for their US office headquarters, but sometimes the call drops after a few minutes due to them outsourcing all their customer service from India. At this point, I'm convinced that they just don't have the money to pay people's incentives and they do whatever they can to get you to give up on getting paid. Just take a look at their TrustPilot and BBB pages-- I wish I had before I signed up for a study with them. I've seen reviews from people saying they've been waiting upwards of a year for their payout. Do yourself a favor and stay far, far away from this fraudulent company."}

I've tried Clickworker and every manner of survey site you can think of (Swagbucks, SurveyJunkie, Inbox Dollars etc) and found them nearly impossible to make even $5 on.

I’m not really someone in crazy need for money and just do this on the side which is why the site is perfect for me. I’ve been on for around 2 weeks now and I’ve already made over $400. You just check in everyday and complete a couple of missions applications that you qualify for and you’ll eventually get into one. They also have express missions which is missions where you apply and can complete them immediately for pay if you qualify, thought these types of missions aren’t available until you complete a lot of applications (I honestly don’t do many of these since I’ve been getting invited to high paying missions). The main thing is to patient when you’re first completing mission applications. Once you finally get an invite and complete your first mission, you start qualifying for a lot more (I think because the system marks you as trustworthy). Once you get invited to a mission, you’re basically guaranteed to get your money too unless you do something dumb. Some missions will be a face to face with an interviewer or a diary mission where you have to write out responses and maybe take a video of yourself talking about a topic. Another great thing is that dscout immediately deposits earnings to your linked PayPal once the money unpends after mission completion (usually a week). Sorry for this long winded reply, but if you or anyone else has questions or needs tips feel free to ask."}

Definitely not banned as support ran me through a couple of troubleshooting steps at the time that did not work. Tried everything I could. My working theory is they either gave up because they couldn't solve my issue (my device is kinda old, so maybe they aren't technically capable enough to bridge that use case) or they purposely locked me out because I wasn't a profitable user (aka, I never did the base XP only questions and only did the XP only boost questions while the time investment made sense). Probably not the latter but regardless, I plan to file a complaint with the BBB since my money is tied up and I haven't gotten a response from them in months.

I made a post back in may when i made almost 3k in once month off beer money sites and im back here again for the year finale! Now before i begin my journey to you guys i just want to put it out there that this job takes TIME and yes A TON OF TIME to get to where i am today. But to say this even though i only made 15k this year i could have made at least 24k if i knew what i was doing and if i didn't play so much video games all the damn time lol. Everyday i get up in the morning to do this type of work, and if you are wondering im living in the US so perhaps things are different across the world. Now this is important so pay attention, im online for about 12-14 HOURS A DAY!!! yes that is a ton of time but im not working all those hours, mainly my time spent is just waiting for tests to come up and on downtime i just watch YouTube or play video games. this job was perfect for a kid like me who had no experience in a real job and needed to get money, now i have enough to buy my first car in about 2 weeks and ill finally be able to travel from my area to find a real job so i can build income to start up my side business! I started with a $50 PC off of ebay and a 60hz monitor found off my dads storage place. Now ive build a PC that's worth 1.5k and have a triple 144hz monitor displays. And yes for this work and if you are looking to make money like i did triple monitor is extremely necessary but you can still do these numbers without it but you will miss some work sometimes, just be faster! In total i have made close to 15k at the end of this month here's the sites i used and a description for each of them: User Testing: $6015 this site was my biggest bread winner of them all, however it took me a ton of time to get here. I have maintained a 5 star rating ever since i became a tester on the site. If you want to make money on this site you need to maintain that high rating. I suggest not doing interview tests as many things could go wrong and could end up in termination of your account, in my opinion not worth but i have done 3 $30 min interviews and they went alright some even end early. Lastly do not expect yourself to make any money the first 3 months, you really need to build that rating up before things happen and even with a high rating like me now, i don't get much tests. I was able to make at least 2k a month on june/july but afterwards the work slowed down like hell and now i make like $50 a week off this site. M-turk: $1632.77 This site is the worst of them all, yep i said it WORSE. However it can still bring you some good money compared to most survey sites out there. This was the 2nd site that i have used when i started my beer money journey and i was working for pennies, but i was WORKING any penny i saw it as an opportunity and as i started doing more and more Hits i started seeing those higher paid ones. I don't like this site much because there are a much of people with automatic accept software's from the site that they pay for and the HITS go away in a blink of an eye. If you could get in mturk, great! but only expect to make around $5 a day with how things are looking like at the moment. Connect: $2044.77 This site was the 2nd one I used, and i was actually invited though it when i was doing a HIT on m-turk. they are very new company but they are like prolific's little brother is what i call it lol. Now this is one of my favorite sites, they are very professional and the work there is nice to do. I see it as a better version of M-Turk and you will sometimes see work that goes upwards of $9+. Prolific: $3989.60 This is the king of the kings. Best survey/study site there is hands down. Very professional staff and workers on this site and was worth every wait on that waitlist. This was my 3rd site that i used. I finally got accepted into mturk around in april-may and i applied in November of last year! If you are on that waitlist you will be there for a bit yeah but worth the wait let me tell ya. there are many tests and studies that come through the entire day similar to connect so always keep that tab open! Swag bucks: $440 This site is where it all started. The site that changed my life! Now is it good no lol but it really entered me into the beer money online world and basically got the train up and running for me. Looking back at it now i get a bit sad because i was just a kid looking for money who could not find a job, i was so desperate i would be on swag bucks for 12 hours a day and be happy if i even made $10 off of that. If you are new to beer money i don't recommend starting with this site, its a huge waste of time, other sites like Prime Opinion. I started picking up the pace with game offers that they had, they pay well but are very time consuming. TELUS: $826.42 Now im not sure if this is considered a beer money site but its online work so ill include it! They pay by the hour and the tasks they assign go away very quickly, but if you hit the maximum hours you can do at least in the job i work in (10hr per week) you can make around $400 a month. This is the closet to an online office job for the sites that i have used and you need to make sure your work is done right or else you are out! This was my last beer money site that i signed up for (besides other minor ones but they didn't generate that much to share). I wish i signed up to this site sooner than later, its basically free money for me. And those are the sites that i have used and are what worked for me! Not going to lie making this post for me was a bit emotional, like seeing where i came from making about $50 a month to like 2k a month was the biggest success in my life time and its only going to get better from here :). Now am i going to continue doing beer money? Yes! but not with the hourly work load that im currently doing, im just super thankful that with this reddit sub i was able to set my life in the right direction to finally make some money to prepare myself for the real world and what's to come. That's it for me folks, i will do my very best to answer all of your questions and if you guys need ANY proof of my income i have no issue showing screenshots of my lifetime earnings from each site :). Thank you everyone in beer money for once again changing my life for the better good, its because of your knowledge that im here today smiling with my dream setup and a giant leap to my life for the next year, my heart goes out to everyone in the SUB! &#x200B;"}

Even sweeter is that in my situation I get annual bonuses ranging from $10k-$30k which are one time lump sums to an RRSP, which easily offsets the tax implications of making $5k. On data annotation, I typically don\u2019t bother with tasks less than $27/hr. Also, not sure why triple monitor matters at all. I mean, great for OP to have a nice desk setup but 3 monitors doesn\u2019t really have anything to do with that. You could buy a 15\u201d laptop or use a desktop with single or dual displays and not miss out on anything as a result\u2026"}

You earn $10.20 per hour to chat with people who are learning English as a second language. For the most part, the conversations are just fun and casual. I talked to a little boy about Batman for half an hour, for example. Occasionally someone will ask me a specific question about English grammar or a certain expression, but if I don't know the answer I can just quickly Google it and send them a link. The best part about it is that you can do it at literally any time of day. I've worked with other similar websites and most of them want you to have a set schedule, which can be difficult when their peak hours are at an inconvenient time due to time zone differences. For instance, another site I've worked with needs teachers to commit to 6-9 pm Beijing time, which is 5-8 in the morning for me. With Cambly I can just sit down and sign on to take calls whenever I feel like it. Also, a lot of the other sites require you to dress professionally or conduct lessons in a very specific way or have a high-quality headset and this site doesn't have very strict rules in that sense. It's very casual, very easy, and actually pretty fun. I applied and was approved within a couple of days, and was able to get started right away. I wish I was able to do it from my iPad, but it's not a big deal to use my laptop. I recommend doing the 'priority hours' if you can -- you get paid to be \"on call\" online even if no one calls you! I just thought you guys might be interested in my take on this site! I can answer any questions you have about how it works! [Referral link]( | [Non-referral link]("}

I actually sent an email to Cambly support to ask about this and they added it to the FAQ. When you answer a call it tells you how much time the student has remaining (based on how much money is in their account or what kind of plan they're on, I believe). Sometimes it says 5 minutes (usually students who got a free trial), sometimes 20 minutes, sometimes 90 minutes. But you don't know ahead of time how long it will say so I wasn't sure if I was allowed to hang up before their time is up. I worked with another website before this and on that one you were not allowed to hang up within the students' time unless there was a major issue and then you had to email the admin and explain the situation. The response I got from Cambly is just to let your student know when you start the call that you only have x amount of minutes to chat. And they also said that if you suddenly have to leave in the middle of a call, just tell your student and say goodbye. The student doesn't lose credit for the remaining minutes, so it's not a big deal for them. If a student reserved a time with you ahead of time (which isn't required, you can just take random calls if you prefer), I think you have to stay on until the end of the time but you will know the length of the call in advance. Also if you're doing a priority hour you aren't supposed to leave in the middle except if you click 'take a 5 minute break.'"}

I have kept track of monthly earnings for each site I do work for since May, so 6 full months.

If I averaged 90 minutes per day, then I averaged $8.47 per hour. I would imagine it's inbetween the two somewhere. I don't get worked up over dollars per hour though. I think of it only as money I have made while sitting on my couch watching television. I'm not a big drinker, so I don't think of it as actual \"beer money\", but even if I do a survey that pays me 50 cents, I think, \"well, I would have been pleased if an item at the grocery store was 50 cents off, and I just earned that in 4 minutes.\" Also, I love the work dress code. :)"}

For the last 6 months, I have been posting my machine learning projects on medium, making up to $180 per article. I started out putting my ideas online just so I could document my projects online. Eventually a publication contacted me saying that they liked my articles and wanted to add my article to their publication. This got me my first 1000 views. I looked into it and found that I could monetize this: Medium users pay a monthly fee to read stories. Writers get a cut of this monthly fee, based on how long the article has been read by the user. For the first month, I only made $24. But slowly, the monthly payment increased into the hundreds! A fter just 6 months, my earnings total $1000 USD! I would encourage people who have something interest to say to post it on medium and consistently make good money. Edit: I think it is important for me to note how much time I put into this venture. So far, I have put in about 26 hours writing article. The articles have made me about 1200 dollars, which amounts to about 45USD per hour."}

I know some people post to medium sort of like a syndacation and then post the same content on their site as well, so you may still own the content, but you don't own the platform. Medium is free to remove your content at any time or demonitize you. So you may build up a steady stream of traffic making a few hundred dollars per month and that can all just dissapear if something happens with medium. If your self hosted then you don't have to worry about that. All you have to worry about is Google updates. It's just a safer way to build passive income with blogging. The only benifit to Medium is that they have a high Domain Authority so your articles will probably rank better and more quickly. But that comes at the cost of less money per 1k views (EPMV) and the risks I mentioned above."}

RentAFriend is a site where you make a profile and rent out your services as a friend. People often need friends to attend concerts, go shopping with, wait in line, be an audience member at a concert, attend school reunions, travel with, and much, much more; the possibilities are endless. While on the site I was paid to be a dance partner for a guy trying to practice dancing for his degree program, I was paid to wait in line, I was paid to watch pets, I was paid to walk pets, I was paid to be a friend for a guy attending a local drag car museum, I was paid to go to school reunions with people, I was paid to go to dances, I was paid to go hiking/ walking with people, I was paid to do some language tutoring for people, and much more! My rates were reasonable at $10.00/ hour, and most jobs lasted several hours, so I could easily make $70.00 per outing. Not bad for basically just hanging out with people all day. It's not a typical beer money job because while you work from home in a sort of independent contractor/ freelancer position, set your own hours and charge your own prices, it isn't grinding or doing anything with referral links or micro tasks. It's literally just being a friend for someone in different ways. You can charge more than what I did per hour or adjust it per outing, so if you are only doing a two-hour friend outing, for example, you could adjust your rate so you are making more on a shorter hour outing. This is an excellent gig and you can potentially make a lot depending on how many friends you meet with a month. For example, if you are making between $70.00 to $100.00 per meeting and you are meeting with people ten times a month, that's $1000.00 a month (at the top price, $100.00)! It's pretty active in my area, and I was hoping that by sharing this resource, it will grow and become more popular in other areas as well. If anyone else has had an experience with RentAFriend, I would love to hear about your experiences. I mostly had positive experiences, and it was actually fun! It's worth checking out."}

I only encountered good clients who were serious about renting out my services as a friend, and some rented out my services more than one time. There are things you can do to keep yourself safe, like reading the profiles of the people who want to rent out your service, talking to them in a private message, and by phone for a while before you meet up with them. Also, tell your friends/ family who you are meeting up with and where you are going every time you meet up with a client. If you do these things, your experience will be positive. I know that I really enjoyed my experience on the site, and I met a lot of really cool people."}

If you install their app and use a referral code, both parties get a free pizza buffet. Couple this with the fact that they have free WiFi, you could go to Cici's early, bring your computer and chill, and eat a couple of meals for free. I've done it before and they've been cool with it. After you sign up with the code, you should get a notification with an hour or two for your free buffet! [Android download link] ( [iOS download link]( ~~Enter my code, '\"[deleted]\", during sign up to get us both free buffets!~~ (**Edit: Thanks for using my code, I've got plenty of free buffets now and actually gave some away to others in this subreddit! Instead of using mine, sort this thread by \"new\" and start a new referral train with someone who hasn't had their code used before.**) Make sure you write it down/copy it to your clipboard before you sign up--I tried switching to my mobile browser to get a referral code, and when I returned to the app I no longer had the option to enter the code and it automatically completed the sign up process. I had to create a new account and memorize the code to get it working. Also, the app seems to only uniquely identify you via email address. So you could sign out, refer yourself using a new email, and keep the endless chain of free pizza (and pasta, salad, and dessert) flowing! **Edit: The free pizza expires 30 days after you receive the credit. So if you won't be able to get to a Cici's in the next 30 days, hold off on signing up.** **Edit 2: If you'd rather not do the buffet, the credit can also be used toward a free large 1-topping pizza.** Edit 3: This really blew up. Glad so many people are getting free pizza! Truly a Christmas miracle :') **Edit 4: FYI, if you sign up with Facebook, you get an additional coupon for a free drink.** Edit 5: (January 11, 2016) Three weeks later and the referral train is still going! If it werent for my New Year's fitness resolutions, I'd keep hitting up that free Cici's as well. Edit 6: For **more free food:** * [The Free Food Guy's Free Food Guide]( * [Caviar Promo Code Megalist for free food + delivery]( * [Get free and heavily discounted food form local restaurants with Delivery.com]( * [Free waffle from Waffle House]( ouse/) * [Free pancakes from IHOP]("}

It was interesting to hear his point of view on the topic and the FCCs motivation, as well as hearing about some of the evidence surrounding the issue. The interview touches on some key concerns people have, and provides more insight than much of the discussion I've seen online. A few things from the podcast sick out in my mind: * The Federal Trade Commission has the authority, and will continue to have the authority, to sanction companies from anti-competitive business practices as well as sanction them for business practices that are predatory or otherwise harmful to consumers. * The FCC, in repealing NN, would still require ISPs to be transparent in their billing and business practices regarding providing preferential treatment to some content over others. * After NN passed, we saw ISPs decrease the amount of money they were investing in infrastructure that wasn't associated with an economic recession. The implication being that NN discouraged companies from growing their services and networks. * I forget the exact statistics, but ISPs had mentioned that they either delayed rolling out or delayed expansion of services because of the increased regulatory burden associated with NN. * The increased regulatory burden acted as a deterrent to current companies and provides a higher barrier to entry for new companies trying to enter the marketplace. This is a major problem in rural areas where there is a need for ISPs to provide services, but the regulatory hurdles make it difficult to open businesses where they are needed. The point here, is if you want more people to have access to internet, you really need to be lowering the regulatory requirements for entering the marketplace. * NN was passed in 2015 or so, so if you remember what the internet was like back then, repealing NN neutrality would return the internet to what it was like back in 2014. * There were no ISPs prior to 2015 and the passing of NN that were providing or were going to provide preferential treatment to content through their networks via 'fast lane' type service. NN was a solution to a problem that *simply didn't exist*."}

Then, if you want to watch it again onDemand, you might have to watch commercials. Comcast then says, \"Well, you can get those TV shows commercial-free, but you'll need to pay for this premium ad-free service.\" So, you're already paying for access to the channel with commercials and you can't get access to the onDemand at all unless you keep paying for that \"basic\" service and then you have to pay more if you want to access the commercial-free option while still paying for the commercials that you never wanted to begin with. Now imagine that you pay a site owner to see premium content, but then your ISP comes along and says, \"Well, that site uses up more bandwidth, you'll have to pay us more money to access it.\" The sticky areas: The ISP is in direct competition with the site where you already pay for a premium service access because the ISP, for example, might offer cable and the premium service site offers commercial free TV and movie streaming. So, you pay a site $15 to watch commercial free TV shows and movies and then your ISP essentially isn't happy that you've chosen their competitor and starts charging you for \"using up too much bandwidth.\" Here's the kicker: Your ISP \"could\" do this even if you rarely use the streaming site. Without Net Neutrality rules in place, they could say that you have to pay a monthly fee to them for the \"privilege\" of accessing that site whether you even go to it because they can't or don't want to track your traffic to the site. Another thing they might do: They might start creating tier access like cable. So, lets say you like to go to CNN, BBC and Facebook along with a free email service, but the ISP wants you to spend more money. So, they put CNN in a basic tier, BBC in a second tier and Facebook in a premium tier and you have to use their preferred email or pay extra to go use your free Yahoo, Gmail, ProtonMail, etc. Of course, use up too much of your data plan that month and you start paying pennies or perhaps even up to ten cents or per URL visit or time you spend on a site. Another possibility: E-stamps. Every time you want to send an email, the ISP starts charging you a small fee. Here's another one: Toll charges. So, you like to visit international websites, do you? Oh well. You have to pay an extra fee every time you do that too. If the owner of your ISP doesn't agree with the type of content you look at, even if it isn't illegal, they might not let you go to a particular site at all."}

I am back to full-time work, and it has been nice not to obsess over every single User Testing screener or Prolific study. I have learned quite a bit, so I wanted to share my perspective on how the last year has gone for me. **For perspective, I posted THIS thread earlier this year. It went into my process, backstory, etc.** [ 1. **Focus on finding employment**. This was obviously the end goal as I have a family and am in my 40s, but there was a part of me after being laid-off that thought MAYBE, JUST MAYBE this could be sustainable. The first month was amazing, and I made about 70% of my full time income, so it seemed like if I just pushed harder and scaled more, I would get there. It proved to be close to, if not completely impossible. The days became too long and those on this forum (and others) who said that this type of work should really just be side-income are correct. 2. **Relying on this kind of work for a full-time income is possible short term, but not sustainable**. This is probably not shocking to most of you, but the frustration that comes with this kind of work, inspite of being 'your own boss' is maddening. The main things you have to watch out for, aside from ambigious thottling on various sites, is the ebb and flow makes it hard to count on. Which brings be to my next point. 3. **Optimize your workspace.** I went a bit crazy, to be honest, but I had multiple monitors, tons of bookmarks and tab setup, lots of browser extensions, and a tablet to do simple surveys on Qmee and similar while I was trying to earn on the computer. 4. **Have primary and secondary earners.** Time is literal money in this space, so having primary and secondary earners is a must. If the primary earner is not hitting that day, move to something like Swagbucks, Qmee, even mTurk to grind some income while you wait for a Prolific study or a User Testing session. This secondary earner is really a dark horse in this method. 5. **Even then, have a backup.** My backup turned out to be super important. It was Clickworker and Field Agent doing in store audits. Yes, I had to spend gas money to get there, but I would often route a list of 4-7 store audits in my 100 mile radius and would do THOSE on the weekends when UT, CCR and Prolific are generally slow. This allowed me to bank some weekend dollars going into the week, keeping my numbers more attainable. 6. **Set a earnings goal number and quota.** I had a initial goal and a stretch goal daily. My initialy goal was $120 and my stretch goal was $200. I had to do WHATEVER I could to get to my initial goal, as that was the number I needed on a weekday to be able to pay basic bills without having to completely destroy my savings. I had only a 3 month expenses worth of savings in my account before I would have had to tap into my retirement (which as someone who has a family and is only 20ish years from retirement, was a hard pill to swallow) 7. **Don't forget taxes.** Even with my overall desperation, I kept about 35% of everything I earned out for taxes. It may not be enough, or maybe I'll have something I can dump into savings once I get all my 1099s. We will see! 8. **Create custom feeds on reddit to keep tabs on the landscape.** I have two, one called The Gigs which are all the subreddits for places like Prolific, User Testing, Connect Cloud Research, Swagbucks etc. I would monitor this throughout the day to see if there was anything hot or worth attention. The other was called The Hustle, which included subs like r/signupsforpay, r/passive_income, r/remotework, r/TELUSinternational etc. I would go to these to check on other potential revenue streams and see if there were remote jobs I could potentially work. 9. **Focus on the money on the table, not chasing affiliates**. If you have things that are working for you (for me that was User Testing) make sure you hit that hard instead of signing up for 100 sites and trying to spam people and reddit with your affiliate codes and links. This takes way more time than you have if you have bills. 10. **Cash out the moment you can.** Don't keep money sitting in Prolific or CCR. Cash out when you hit any minimum and have that money in your own account. Goes without saying. I have made a bit over 20k this year, mainly between February and July. User Testing was my primary earner, with Clickworker, Prolific, Cloud Connect doing heavy lifting. dScout, mTurk, Qmee, Swagbucks, Serpclix, Yougov, Intellizoom, Ivueit, Field Agent, UHRS and a few others also chipped in. Anyway, I felt an obligation to share some of my journey because so many of you helped ME when I was in my worst spot. I am now gainfully employed, things are settled down, and I hop on to beermoney sites every so often to earn a little extra, like it's intended to be!"}

Not UHRS but the in-store shelf audits), 12% was Connect Cloud and then 3% dScout and misc - This was dictated basically by what I focused on most. If UT was slow (for example, a VPN trigged a one week ban) and I focused on Connect, I made about 200 dollars that week on Connect. My survey experience improved when I was able to get on Prolific, but that happened after I started back to work on my new job. The Clickworker audits were really the dark horse here. When ALL other sites are slow on the weekend, I would be able to crank through these $44 dollar audits, and could schedule 5 of them in a day (although that was a lot of driving and physical work taking photos inside stores) - I even went as far as wearing a hi-vis vest and a badge I made so people would stop giving me weird looks haha"}

So yeah, the early studies were dry, but I kept going because after Swagbucks and that level of \"survey\", this was a significant improvement. Now that I'm over 500, I've been getting higher value surveys and longitudinal studies (they pay you to fill out multiple surveys over a period of time). Some of those studies are quite interesting.

You can earn a lot more money on this site than other typical /r/beermoney sites, but you need to pay attention to which jobs you accept. Not all HITs pay well.

We get daily reports of them banning/freezing users arbitrarily and keeping all their earnings, forcing ID checks with Veriff (1.8 star rated) and then still banning most users afterwards anyway. **Also an excessive 5% fee on PayPal and Crypto withdrawals**. AVOID! AVOID! AVOID! \u2716 **[Paidverts]( \u2014 Shady owner, sketchy site. Keeps doing debt swaps (cash to BAP). Do not post. \u2716 **[Neobux]( \u2014 It isn\u2019t *really* a scam, but they operate as a pyramid scheme. There\u2019s money to be made online, but it\u2019s definitely not there. \u2716 **[MarketGlory]( \u2014 It does pay out, but the pay is absolutely ridiculous. The only way to make a decent amount of money is to have a lot of referrals, and referral whoring on this subreddit WILL result in a permanent ban. \u2716 **[MindSumo]( \u2014 Not actually a /r/beermoney site. It\u2019s only spam in this sub. \u2716 **[G2A]( \u2014 Scam/sells stolen keys. \u2716 **[Quickthoughts]( \u2014 Many reports of people being banned when trying to withdraw as of 10/2018. Do your due diligence before possibly wasting your time on this app. \u2716 **Sites with $100+ minimum** \u2014 These sites usually offer higher than normal payments for simple tasks, with a high minimum to cash out. They are *always* scams. \u2716 **Generic news sites** that pay you ridiculous amounts to read an article (two euros??) \u2014 Common sense should take care of this, but in case it doesn\u2019t, it\u2019s always a scam. The site is usually hosted somewhere in Eastern Europe, and you will never get paid. \u2716 **Free bitcoin sites/\"faucets/cloud mining\" (THIS INCLUDES QOINPRO)** \u2014 This is not referring to those video-viewing/task sites (although they\u2019re still paying fragments of a penny). I\u2019m talking about sites that give you 0.000001BTC to fill a captcha (freebitco.in, dailybitcoins). Admittedly many beermoney sites pay low, but don\u2019t even bother with these. Also: *Bitcoin mining is NO LONGER PROFITABLE.* If you're really so keen on getting bitcoins, doing so through an exchange is your best option.

If this sounds like you, check out this post -", "content": "OKAY. So I\u2019m a goof, right? I spent a year browsing this sub and just felt every single method here was just oddly difficult to enter. I don\u2019t know why I was like that, but I was, and in talking with friends I\u2019ve found it\u2019s a fairly common. If you\u2019re a regular on here and you know what you\u2019re doing, much of this is going to seem obvious, but if you\u2019re interested in getting some scratch for minimal effort and just haven\u2019t found the right sources for it, try starting with these apps: 1. CROWDTAP This is a survey app available on all sources, as well as a website. Very popular here because everyone gets accepted and you get surveys you\u2019ll never get screened out of. This is an easy $10 a week in gift cards and can be more if you\u2019re diligent. Either way, a very easy $20-80 a month depending on how much you want to put in. 2. ZOGO This is a financial literacy app that pays you for taking little crash courses on finance - put in the work and you can get $5 a day in gift cards, though I\u2019ll say it slows down your points per question eventually and becomes much less profitable with time. Still - an app I recommend to younger folks for the education alone! You learn a lot here. 3. CASHWALK It\u2019s easy. $5 every 20 days or so for walking and tapping some coins on your app. Not a big money maker but so so simple! 4. Receipt Hog Complete the entry offer and get $5 day one. Slow going beyond that. 5. CloudResearch It\u2019s like prolific, but easier to get accepted to\u2026 Highly recommend this survey site and has the potential to get you more money than any of the other items listed so far. 6. Prolific\u2026 duh. But like\u2026you got to get accepted. I was lucky enough to get in after 2-3 weeks and make $200+ per month here. Anyways\u2026 I know this is recycled info but I do feel this is the easiest ENTRY to beermoney for those of you interested. Thoughts and suggestions welcome in the comments!"}

Not banned yet tho so it's pretty decent despite the frequent technical issues. Paidviewpoint is a pretty good hidden gem similar to crowdtap. Payout to paypal which I prefer over amazon gc. Microsoft Rewards is also one of my favs because it doesn't take any brain power, just a min or so every day. Hitpredictor is by far one of the best all around tho imo. ~15m once a week listening to a clip from 15 songs and selecting how much you like them. No brain power needed and you get 5 bucks. When you have enough points, buy 7 tickets to a weekly raffle and you have a pretty good chance at an extra 20$ or 50$. I do a bunch of other sites, but they're not much to write home about. I like the sites where you do something little every day and get like 5$ a month because I put them on my todoist and they're pretty manageable to get done thru the day while WFH."}

Shopkick is another good app, especially if you purchase a lot of stuff online, you get points per dollar you spend, and you get points from walking in certain stores and scanning barcodes of items in store, sometimes if you purchase items they have listed you can receive 50-200+ points for uploading your receipt."}

I also go dscout from one of the comments (haven't tried it yet) of the three I've tried, Crowdtap seems to be the most efficient. I say this because I've spent maybe 30 minutes total on it and I already have 600 points. So by that math I should have a $20 gift card in about 3 or so hours which comes out to about $6-7 an hour which is TERRIBLE when compared to working at a job but AMAZING, when you realize how simple this is and you don't have to do it all at once. I could do some while waiting in lines or wherever etc.... The only variable is if I'm able to constantly get surveys or not. Anyway, thank you!!! Edit 3/24/23: I deleted Zogo because it got a little boring. I JUST got banned on crowdtap. No idea why but I stopped getting surveys. I did this for about 1 hour yesterday and had a total of 1000 coins and then the surveys stopped and today I got banned. Just deleted it. No reason why or email or anything. So far I only have cashwalk , waiting on Prolific, and dscout. Dscout I've gotten through to the application on like 5 of them just waiting to see if I get picked for any.... cashwalk pays you like $5 a month or so which is not terrible especially since my battery life isn't affected. I've heard of people getting banned there too so let's see."}

This doesn't necessarily fall under self-employment, because it doesn't require a tax-id, and in most cases, doesn't even require your SSN, so nothing can be linked or tied to your name other than the fact that you have an account on various survey sites. gotta love confidentiality clauses. On average, between all the sites I use, i make around $1,000/year. It's not much obviously, but it's fun-money. When i first got into mysurvey.com, I made around $100 my first month in rewards. Ended up with two pre-paid tickets to the movie theater (Cinemark no less. one of the big theater chains) and a $50 gift card to Applebee's. convinced my neighbor to babysit my kids for $10, and we had dinner and a movie for my wife and I on-the-house. Right now i'm making about $30/month with mysurvey. SurveySavvy.com is a little weird in that unless you don't mind your every move being tracked, you're not going to make a whole lot of money. I usually leave it turned off unless I get a project (SurveySavvy has regular 20-30 minute surveys on products, and the occasional \"project\" which is worth a substantial amount of coin. I just qualified for one yesterday. On Feb 27th-28th, it wants my kid to use the iPad to watch the nick app and the pbs app and I get paid $50 to take 4 5-minute surveys and a 30-minute follow up survey. That's not bad in my book. I made about $300 last year in projects and another $30 or so in surveys. By having the tracking software installed, you automatically make $60/year just for having it installed. (I think you might need to have the trifecta and have it installed on pc, smartphone, AND tablet. not sure.) Like I said, with SurveySavvy, you have to decide whether or not you want to be tracked. If you're okay with that, there's lots of money being made. mturking is slowly starting to pay off, but I don't bother with /r/HITsWorthTurkingFor unless I happen to see a very recent post, as most of them are dead by the time you see them. hunting through the HITs is easier, imho. I can make $5-$10/day easy without breaking a sweat, which is around $3,650/year. (making $10/day) I just signed up for pinecone research, and i've done a couple of surveys. up to $2 so far, waiting on real surveys to show up. I used to pinecone years and years ago, so i'm really excited to be back on the panel. I made good money with pinecone research. And product testing was always interesting. Can't beat being the first one to see a new product coming on the market some day. Between all of those, assuming I stick with it (mturking is the bane of my existence, but I am paying back a debt with it. lol. $10 at a time.) i can easily make $5,000+/year tax free that the government needs to know about."}

Some examples that I can recall off the top of my head include: * Pauses should be noted with a comma unless they are over 1 second, then use a period. * For pauses longer than 3 seconds use elipses. * Um's and Ah's should be noted, unless they are consecutive. etc... * If a word is illegible use [undetermined] There's a lot more, I don't recall to be honest. You really do have to listen to the recording multiple times, this is awfully boring if your slow to transcribe or the speakers are unclear.

I used to be a recruiter at a market research facility. The purpose of what you're talking about is to keep you from finding out exactly what the client conducting the survey/focus group is looking for so that you do not *lie for free money* and skew market research. Two funny things about this part, one in general and one specifically about phone call surveys/focus group recruiting: (1) No, your responses that are rejected (because you don't qualify) are not given back to the client. They aren't interested in your opinion because you aren't the type of respondent they want to talk to, which is why you didn't qualify. Most often, you are of a consumer opinion or of a social class (income too low, no undergrad degree, etc.) that the client companies don't have any interest in catering to. There are quotas on all demographic markers and you will be rejected if the quotas you would meet are already full (unless recruitment is struggling and a deadline is around the corner). (2) Telephone recruiters at most marker research facilities don't receive commission and work is limited, comes in booms and busts. Not everyone has work to do all of the time, only the \"top recruiters\" are called into work during these times. What is a \"top recruiter\"? They are the employees that reach quotas and close studies the quickest. There's no such fucking thing as a \"top recruiter\" as every person that answers the phone for you is going to have random ass answers. \"Top recruiters\" are actually just excellent at manipulating you into saying what's necessary to qualify or, in some cases, blatant lying. It's an unspoken but known practice in the office. You close a study, your supervisors thank you and tell you what a good job you did, you feel good about it even though you know this job is all about luck and lies, all because you're making minimum wage and you're just praying they don't cancel your hours next week. The only good part about (2) is that it's actually helping correct the market because it's bypassing the client's marketing bias so they can hear opinions outside of their preferred demographic. Sometimes there's legitimate reasons for the demographic preference but other times not, sometimes it's for insidious reasons. Example using confidential information idgaf about revealing: Sea World was a client of ours when the Blackfish shit hit the fan--we had to rule out any respondents belonging to environmental or animal rights groups. They could not participate per the clients' stipulations. Ok this is turning into one part story hour, one part expos\u00e9 now. The long and short of it is they're doing that to you on purpose so that **you** do not act fraudulently, and it's easier to act fraudulently to get into the study if you do the recruitment survey over the phone and have a bit of social engineering experience. Bonus: you usually won't have to go through the whole fucking survey over the phone if you disqualify early on."}

That's a great exchange for us still and makes Prolific still lucrative for us whereas the reverse would be true for you if you cashed out from an American site and converted to dollars."}

Now that it is all over with, I took the time to finally track how much I've made over the past 2 years or so. &#x200B; Microworkers - $733.10 UserTesting - $173.00 RedBubble $305.53 &#x200B; This all sums up to $1211.63... Not a bad amount for someone starting out at 13 years old in his bedroom. I just wanted to share what I've earned because all of this is from the community I discovered here and I cannot thank all of you enough for what I have learned here. &#x200B; If you're wondering why I quit doing these gigs, now that I'm older and have more freedom in life I believe I can make a ton more just going outside and seeking work considering I live in NYC. If I was still lacking the opportunity I once did however, I would continue this journey as it was decent spending money. &#x200B; For a full view of what the payout was for each site every time I got paid, you can view the [spreadsheet here]( &#x200B; Thanks again and good luck on your hustle!"}

It has a $1 monthly fee. For small investments (<$100 per month), a $1 fee is more than 1%. That's too high! It is free for college students though. A nice alternative is WiseBanyan which is free and invests in a similar portfolio to Acorns. The only benefit to Acorns is the rounding up feature. Do this instead: 1. Download your credit card statements for the last one year in excel 2. Roundup all expenses to the next largest dollar. 3. Calculate the difference between the rounded up amount and original amount 4. Aggregate these differences by month 5. Take the average of these aggregates 6. Set up recurring investments to your wisebanyan portfolio for this average amount every month This is a one-time activity and will give you all the benefits of passive investment while not paying any fees."}

I have a six year old daughter. My wife works retail (lower tier, not management) so we were able to obtain health insurance. I have some savings but I need to keep at least a consistent income coming in to make it until I found a comparable job to my previous (REDDACTED) - job market is tough locally where I live (Midwest) so while I apply and interview for jobs I decided to see what I could do online to make ends meet. **This forum was the first place I landed on in my search.** Since December I have been able to scale my online work to $200 dollars a day, primarily with a combination of UHRS through clickworker, Connect Cloud, Prolific and UserTesting. Recently I have added dscout to the mix. I have kicked around maybe a dozen sites I learned about here, and landed on a routine that works for me. I do intend to share my \u201cwho paid me\u201d data on April 1st. There are some others as well. For the past four weeks I ***have averaged 200 dollars a day Monday-Friday and approx 20 a day on the weekend***. I know that this isn\u2019t sustainable long term, but as I continue my employment seeking journey, I just wanted to say thanks to the community! I am happy to answer any questions or share things I\u2019ve learned. I\u2019m not professing to be an expert in this kind of work but as someone who was staring down the barrel of foreclosure in three months once my savings ran out, I definitely dove in head first on trying to figure out how to earn while I looked for work. I\u2019m forever grateful. **Primary Earners:** * **UserTesting** \\- User experience testing, mostly vocal and video. * **Connect Cloud Research** \\- Survey site, Prolific's less 'prolific' cousin * **Prolific** \\- I was intially waitlisted but now doing about $10-20 dollars a day * **UHRS (clickworker)** \\- Store-shelf audits (phone app) * **dscout** \\- Surveys that contain selfie videos. * **IntelliZoom** \\- User experience testing, similar to UserTesting (and owned by them) **Secondary Earners:** * **Serpclix** \\- latent web site click bank/SERP improvements (just clicking websites) * **Swagbucks** \\- Mainly for rebates when I grocery shop converted to giftcards * **IVueIt** \\- They are based in the midwest and have contracts near me, on-site photo projects * **Mturk** \\- Mainly surveys at this stage for someone like me. * **Adsense** (through a website I started in 2022, but minimal payout), * **Respondent** \\- User experience and interviews **Work Setup:** I have three monitors, one vertical monitor where I track everyting I earn/work on via Spreadsheet, and two 27 inch monitor. The one on my far right has five windows open, UserTesting, UserCrowd, Connect Cloud Research, UHRS (all in Chrome) and then I have a Firefox window open with SerpClix. I'll drag the window I am working on in that moment the main monitor. I also have a tablet on stand in front of the vertical monitor and I will do surveys there if everything else is dead (Prime Opinon, swagbucks, YouGov) **Edit on 3/17:** Also wanted to mention I run an auto-refresher on Connect Cloud Research which greatly increased my earnings there. **Edit on 3/18:** I passed my entrance test on IntelliZoom (another UserTesting owned property) and I am getting a decent amount of screener and similar UX tests on that website) - I added IntelliZoom to my primary earners as I have already completed 80 dollars of screeners in 2 days. Also added some descriptions of my earners. **Edit on 4/1:** Here is who paid me this month! |Service|January|February|March|April| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |Serpclix|23.55|42.35|10.4|| |Clickworker||31.93|104.11|| |Usercrowd||10||| |UserTesting|40|521|3085|| |Amazon Mechanical Turk|6.38|||| |SwagBucks||25|25|| |YouGov||||| |dScout||55|95|| |Cloud Connect Research||450.89|106.54|| |[Respondent.io]( |Adsense (websites)||100.23||| |OneForma|||51.02|| |||||| |**Monthly Total**|188.68|1378.9|3477.07|| |**Self-Employment Tax**|18.16|210.97|521.56|| |**22% Marginal Tax**|41.5|303.35|764.96|| |**Net Income**|129.02|856.55|2190.55|| **Edit on 8/29:** I have started a new job, so I have scaled back Beermoney.

The work I get is mostly training AI Chatbots, they give me some content guidelines but within those I can talk to the bots about whatever I want. I create a prompt and 2 bots reply. I rank which is better and sometimes explain why then continue the conversation like that. Since I signed up about a year ago, there's been maybe a combined total of 12 hours where I didn't have work available which was due to maintenance or updating the projects. Pay for the projects I've been enabled on have always paid $20/hr and I've worked on one's paying as high as $35/hr. I can work anytime I want, from my phone or pc & have no limit on how much work I can do. The phone UI is a bit squished tho, but I work from my phone while going for my daily walks lol getting paid to get some exercise has been sweet. Some peeps here have apparently had problems like externally being wait listed, or being removed without warning from all projects but idk it's been great for me \u200d\u2642\ufe0f I just am careful to adhere to guidelines/grading scales and try to submit quality work."}

On another random note, how often do you cash out on CRC? I've been reading of people being banned/froze accounts when they cash out big amounts? I thought of cashing out on a daily/every other day thing so I don't exceed a certain cashout number....but i am just wondering if you are cashing out constantly or waiting for the big number to cash out?

YTD I have earned $12,055 on 1153 tests completed. I have a 5 star rating. Most of my income now comes from $10 dollar tests as I do not have the same time to commit to it as I did before I started my new full-time employment. * My secondary earner is now ClickWorker - I have been doing store visits/audits primarily and have been making approximately $200-300 a month with ClickWorker. * iVueIt and Field Agent has also been consistent, to the tune of about $100 a month. My schedule looks as follows: * UserTesting and Connect screeners from 645am-8am then head to work. * Work, family, homework etc. * 9pmish until 11pmish UserTesting * Two weekend days a month: Full days (12 hours) of ClickWorker store audits / visits * Backfill with iVueIt and Field Agent where applicable.

A bulk of my transcription came from those receipt sites and cloudcrowd, cloudcrowd paid better, so ymmv when it comes to doing transcription work in mturk. i got locked out of my account when my kid broke my phone and was never approved for my new one. I used to do transcription for rev but hated it because accents suck. So I switched to closed captioning since most of the computer does the work so all I have to do is align the text to the video. i'm getting irritated by the inconsistent grading from rev and some days i don't feel like doing captioning every day. i use shiftsmart, survey merchandiser, and field agent to get out the house for a bit. shiftsmart is tripping and now will suspend you for 7 days if you get below 50% approval rating (I tend to call off last minute cos my kiddo gets sick and I have to pick him up). i like shiftsmart since I can get paid that day but the recent rule changes made it annoying and makes work take longer to finish on time since i have to take a picture for everything that i do. Field agent is ok but most of the time it's a wash since a lot of the times I can't find the items they request and it's becoming a waste of time and effort. I don't drive and the stores tend to be within walking distance so I can get away with having no items to scan or take pictures of. But for others, driving around and losing out on gas is not ideal. I need to pay bills so I'm back to rev and doing surveys. still looking for regular online work. it's hard out here and the state i'm in doesn't qualify for remote work most times and the few who do it's very competitive. oh yeah, i also use mode earn app so I can make monies by playing music. If I play music within mode and mess about with some of the games i can usually crank out $20 a week in paypal. &#x200B; Good luck!"}

In the U.S. it is legal to \"donate\" twice a week, but it is not safe. I've done it about 10 times in the last 2 months and my body is a wreck, no energy, napping all the time, constantly hungry, blowing up in weight from water retention because my body is desperately holding onto fluids. They undersell the side effects and dangers at every turn, but some light googling will get you a lot of rants about people's health being compromised. In the U.K. they allow \"donating\" twice a month, not twice a week. Red Cross has similar guidelines. Pretty much the FDA doesn't care about your health, and neither do plasma donation centers, so they'll go ahead and cause serious damage to you. CSL doesn't just allow you to \"donate\" beyond what is reasonably healthy, the incentivize it. First \"donation\" in a week is only $30, but second is $49. There's also a $50 bonus for selling plasma eight times in a single month, four times what is a sensible amount to sell. They could just as easily make it \"$49 every other donation\" or \"$50 every 8 donations\", but no, they put the limited time frame to squeeze as much blood out of you as possible in as short of time as possible. Also that $50 for 8 times in a month? Good luck, I made it to 6 before they bruised me so badly I wasn't allowed to sell again for the rest of the month. Suckered me in with the predatory payment plan, then don't even pay me. I'm desperate for cash and suicidal anyways so my health isn't a big deal, but the predatory practices I see from this place disgusts me, so I figured I'd put the rant out there to dissuade anyone on the fence about going to these horrific places. &#x200B; Edit: I forgot about aftercare. There is none, they have chairs. No juice, no cookies, none of the basic get your energy back spread you get when donating blood. They have crackers upon request, and the staff will give you attitude if you dare to ask about these mystery crackers. Edit: They bruised me badly on the 6th donation this month too. So looks like I'm not getting the bonus, again. It is like they do this shit on purpose."}

The most important minerals are salt, potassium which you can get from that NoSalt, NuSalt stuff, and magnesium which you can get from cheap dollar-store epsom salts.

My experience has been mixed. They are in a bad part of town, and the staff are overworked. The nurses there are great, but the phlebotomists are definitely hit and miss. One of them did give me a hematoma once (she no longer works there, not sure if that had anything to do with it though), and I've never been able to use that vein since without issues, so now I tell them where to stick me. The pay system is weird. You get $20 (added to a prepaid mastercard) on you 1st donation of the week, then $40 on your 2nd donation of the week. They have weekly and monthly bonuses as well that fluctuate wildly with no rhyme or reason that I can figure out. A nurse gave me a physical my 1st day. They test for drugs and stds when you start, and every 4 months after that. Every visit, they check your weight, bp, heart rate, blood protein, and hemacrit to make sure you're able to donate safely. They give you sodium citrate anticoagulant, then saline on your last return cycle. The citrate can apparently deplete calcium in your body and was causing my teeth to hurt, but taking a calcium supplement after donating has helped that. I also drink a gatorade and eat lunch right after. It does make me tired, especially when it's hot out, but I'm usually okay in a couple hours. Most of the other problems can be solved by diet. Eat lots of lean protein and green veggies. I drink a protein shake the night before and another on the way there. Limit fatty foods, especially dairy. It slows down your donation, and can even clog up the lines if there's too much fat in your blood. And drink tons of water. Seriously, however much you're drinking, drink more. Keep your pee clear. Sorry for writing a novel, but hope this helps anyone wondering what to expect. Sorry about your problems OP. I have been there too, sometimes still am. I sincerely hope things get better for you."}

They don't normally provide juice or sweets in the clinic where I go either, just water; but I usually bring in sweets for the nurses and they are nice enough to share with their next patients. Having said that I don't feel the need for sweets and usually walk home afterwards. My guess is that you are having some other issue, possibly caused by anemia or being dehydrated."}

I used to feel sick when I first started in college. You didn\u2019t used to get saline then - instead you juice. Now you get saline and it\u2019s way better. Now we get saline - no juice - which is way better in my opinion. The number of times that you can donate is determined by the government - possibly the FDA. So it\u2019s twice a week everywhere in the US. And of course they incentivize it - that\u2019s how they get people to do it. I get $30 the first donation in the week and $50 the second. Sometimes they do frequency bonuses on top of that ( like getting an extra $50 if you donate 8 times in the calendar month. The incentive is a little different every month.) My experience is nothing like yours. My energy levels are fine - but I also try to eat a relatively healthy diet. I drink TONS of water, I supplement my electrolytes (due to eating low carb). Every couple of months I\u2019ll feel awful a which most likely has to do with what I\u2019ve eaten or drank. Just because that is your experience doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s dangerous. Sounds like it\u2019s something that just doesn\u2019t work for you. Doesn\u2019t mean it doesn\u2019t work for everyone else. Donating plasma paid my bills in college when I couldn\u2019t find a job. It helped me pay my student loans and put food in my mouth when I couldn\u2019t afford it. It helped me pay for my wedding, pay rent, and buy a house. I paid for a trip to Paris EXCLUSIVELY using plasma money that I saved up. Right now it\u2019s helping me pay off a $3000 credit card. When I pay that off I\u2019m going to save my plasma money to pay for a trip to Rome and also Greece next year. I\u2019m so thankful for the ability to \u201cdonate\u201d plasma. It\u2019s truly helped me for things I needed, and now for things I want. I don\u2019t plan on donating forever. My student loans will be paid off in 5 years, and after paying off all my husbands and my credit cards, I\u2019ll stop donating - maybe. If anyone has questions about the process - I\u2019m more than 500 donations in so I\u2019d be glad to answer to the best of my ability."}

That's nothing. I've worked for Octapharma, and I'm a Hemophiliac, so plasma is my life as it's used for my medication. Plasma is a booming industry. My medication is made from plasma. One vial on FEIBA is a dollar a unit. I take 7000 units every 6 hours when I have a bleed. Bleeds tend to last for about a week at least. That's 4 times daily. 7 days a week. That's 28 times. That's $196,000 for a week. I alone use millions of dollars a year. And that's one medication. I take 2! Each liter of plasma is worth $200. $500 after the manufacturing process. (Cleaning) So you're right. Donors aren't getting anywhere near what their plasma is worth. But...donating isn't a job. It's not supposed to be. It's supposed to be about doing something for a good cause. Healing those like myself, who depend on donors to stay alive and active. The money is just an incentive. So to those who donate, thank you for your service."}

Allowing a flip of 500% profit from strategically targeting desperate and impoverished communities (especially communities of color) while trying to trap them into this cycle of dependence is gross, and the US continually has allowed companies to profit over instead of defending the dignity of its citizens by requiring sufficient compensation.

Donating isn't for everyone, I agree, but many donors have been donating for decades and continue to do so with no negative experiences. And the government allows 104 donations per year because the body is extremely good about replenishing the proteins being donated. Plasma companies check for these levels during every visit, not only for the safety of the donor but because their entire business is based on collecting those proteins. There's simply no point in collecting the plasma if the donor hasn't been able to replenish their blood supply. You seem to have some resentment for the idea that they are a for-profit business, but I think you need to speak with someone who is a patient of IgG plasma therapies and ask them if they think that plasma collection companies are predatory. They are literally only still alive today because of the medicines being made by these plasma companies. There is no other alternative for them and their quality of life is significantly impacted by shortages of the medicine due to demand outpacing production. And the U.S. (likely BECAUSE it allows for paid donation and frequent donation) is the world's largest supplier of source plasma even despite the global need for greater amounts of supply. And the government realizes this fact too. They do regulate the quality of plasma and safety of donors, but they also see the big picture that the globe is desperate for more plasma. So in the absence of any evidence of long term ill effects, I don't see why they would be inclined to change the status quo. Edit: Most of this article is unfortunately behind a pay wall, but this recent article from the Wall Street Journal discusses the global supply challenges with plasma right now and the impact it has on patients who can't receive their medication because of it. Donating plasma isn't personally for me, but I don't knock anyone for doing so or the companies who are collecting it. The people in this article are entirely dependent on it."}

That said, what I asked about \"Our bodies absorb the stuff in meat a lot easier than plants, even if you run them through a blender first.\" is misleading. We only absorb (some) of the iron better because of the form it is in and the difference can be essentially removed with some citrus/vitamin C. EDIT: I did google a bit and found this interesting paper \"3. The spinach Fe was well utilized by the rats with average HRE of 0.41, 0.53 and 0.36, and apparent Fe absorptions averaging 0.48, 0.59 and 0.37 for the severely anaemic, mildly anaemic and non-anaemic animals respectively. 4. Beef Fe was efficiently used by rats as reported by others. Average HRE were 0.42, 0.51 and 0.44, and average apparent Fe absorptions were 0.44, 0.47 and 0.46 for the severely anaemic, mildly anaemic and non-anaemic rats respectively. 5. When the percentage of meat Fe was increased from 0 to 25, 50, 75 or 100 of the dietary Fe, HRE and apparent Fe absorption were not increased significantly. A meat enhancement effect on total Fe absorption, reported by others for non-haem-Fe, did not occur in the present experiment\" So if you're mildly anemic, like you just lost a bunch of blood for some reason, you'd absorb the iron in spinach better than in beef (if we assume rats are equivalent to people).

I\u2019m making this post from an iPad sitting on my belly in a hospital bed. As many of you know I\u2019ve been missing for a month and there were some posts about my health. The outpouring of support from people in this community has been amazing and humbling. So I thought I would give an update. So what happened you ask... well in the days leading up to sept 21. I was feeling worse and worse. I had an infection going through my system. I thought I could just fight it off. Then I stated having trouble breathing. So trip to the hospital. I thought I would get some antibiotics and be home later. Well turns ou my foot had an infected wound and that infection was running through my body. I was septic. My blood sugar was 500. I was showing signs of respitory failure. Had I waited 1 more day I probably would have died. I was immediately sent to surgery to drain the infection. Unfortunately it was too late. After 3 attempts to get rid of the infection it was determined that the bone tissue was already dead. My only option to stop the spread of infection was to have my left foot amputated. That was October 5th. Today I\u2019m in the rehab wing of the hospital. I have to learn how to do thing ina wheelchair. How to take care of myself. How to maybe hop on one leg. And hope sometime I\u2019ll be able to get a prosthetic. This has been he biggest challenge of my life. Not just physically but mentally and emotionally. To look down and see part of your body missing is a complete mind fuck. I\u2019ve spent too much time feeling sorry for myself. And dealing with a wide range of emotions while trying to keep my mind from going to darker places. This community has helped. The gofundme that was set up was amazing and I thank everyone who contributed so much. But reading the messages from people who talked about how my posts and messages have helped them financially made me feel so good. To know I\u2019ve helped so many and that even if I had died I would have a bit of a legacy means so very much to me. I don\u2019t know when I\u2019ll be returning to beermoney. I face weeks to months of rehab. And I need to find the money to build a ramp and remodel certain parts of the house to be assessable. But I will be back someday. I miss the challenge of earning this way and I miss this community of people. That oft mentioned website I had planned is on hold too. But my awesome web dev has said we can restart whenever I\u2019m ready. I hate that this post is all about me and not about beermoney really. But I felt an update was in order. I thank you all for the support. I feel like I wanted to say more but the words aren\u2019t coming now. I have a huge challenge ahead. And I\u2019m scared I\u2019m not going to be able to meet it. More scared than I have ever been in my life. But I\u2019m going to call everything I have from deep inside me. It\u2019s time to go Beastmode Level: OX!! And I challenge you all to do the same with your earnings, Thank you all so much Themightyox"}

That's definitely unfortunate. I can see how that would be a broader overall statistical pattern. It hasn't been my personal experience at all though. Personal experiences don't always reflect statistical data. For example, I've heard that more men than women are left-handed, but I know more left-handed women than left-handed men. I have noticed, in both men and women I know who refuse to go to the doctor, another thing they have in common is they're more paranoid, less trusting. My mom (who would make more than two years between doctor's visits seem downright regular and responsible) is one of the most paranoid people I know. It's something of a stereotype, that may hold water in general statistics but is useless for individuals, that women are more apt to solve problems through social connections, i.e., asking another person for help, seeing other people as resources rather than as threats. (Whether that's nature or nurture is inconclusive, but my vote's for nurture.) This is something my mom would pretty much rather eat shit than do. In some psychological sense, the willingness to go to a doctor might be tied to the willingness to ask another person for help--or the general belief that people are helpful versus out to harm you. The women and men that I know who are most averse to seeing doctors also tend to believe in general that other people are out to harm them, and that hiding vulnerability is smart because others will exploit it, rather than seeking help with a vulnerability. It correlates pretty heavily with more agoraphobic tendencies, in my experience, especially the more extreme cases. I think men are taught a lot more that others will hurt them if they show any weakness, though some women come to that same conclusion. On some subconscious level, that belief may make it hard to show vulnerability to a doctor. Obviously, poverty is also a pretty strong factor. But I've noticed as well, that while poverty does explain not wanting to spend money you don't have on healthcare, that people who have experienced poverty are often still reluctant to see a doctor even when the financial obstacle is removed. You'd think they'd be rushing to get a doctor, if money was all that was in the way. But I think part of the trauma of poverty is feeling like the world is out to get you, because well, it kind of is. Feeling financially threatened at the doctor's might cement the doctor in one's mind as a threat, as someone out to hurt you, even if this time it was free. This is all really intersectional, I think, gender and class and race all probably influence it, and can interact in ways that are more than the sum of their parts. The worst is that I'm not a lot better than my mom when it comes to this. I hated what she put me through, when she was sick and I had to watch her get worse, of preventable problems, and you'd think I'd vow to never do that. But when push comes to shove, I'm just as much, \"eh, maybe I can handle this on my own.\" I see it in myself and I hate it."}

It can help you as much as you help them. Most of the time they may use a few phrases they know and kinda stall out since their English learning over there is rough to say the least. The longer you talk the more money you get so that is a nice motivator. Sometimes they might just want to hear you talk as A LOT don't feel confident in their English skills, even the ones that sound like they grew up in Florida. Just use basic stuff like, what's your name, age, job, major, what do you like to do, what do you want to do and branch out from there. No pressure on you just do your best and it'll come along."}

Paidviewpoint is legit in terms of pay per minute. It's not great in terms of pay per week, since they don't have surveys that often, and they get filled quickly, but every time you snag a survey, if you get the full survey you'll be compensated adequately, and if you don't qualify, you'll get screened out in under a minute, and be paid 10 cents anyway. I've only had a couple instances where surveys have bugged out at the end and didn't pay, and when I told their support that happened, they bonused me a reasonable amount soon afterwards. Forthright (used to be Innopoll) is good for that too, as long as you only do their first-party surveys and immediately trash their third-party ones - they pay 2 bucks for every 3 first-party surveys you finish (whether completed or screened out), making them solid for that reason alone (I usually screen out, but I'm not sad about it making 67 cents anyway. :D) But yes, academic survey sites (i.e. mturk and prolific) are totally the best, since you can actually *filter* surveys instead of just having to take whatever they give you, one at a time. Plenty of crap on both of those sites (though less on prolific, since they have more rigorous rules for disallowing crap, but crap still gets through sometimes), but in any case, you can identify the crap and then just not bother."}

It\u2019s been two years since this post has been updated, and I\u2019ve had a few requests to update it. As I have gotten busier, with a job and family, I haven\u2019t had time to grind out survey routers in quite a while. However, I still have a great beermoney routine that allows me some extra fun money. I have basically fully switched to programs that don\u2019t disqualify participants. These beermoney programs have tasks that range from about 30 seconds to 15 minutes, but they don\u2019t disquality and are worth your time. Unfortunately, some programs from last time I updated this seem to be dead, so I have removed those. There are some new programs I\u2019m using here as well. I also have updated all info in this post to the best of my knowledge. Hoping that this list is helpful to those who have busy lives, but still want to earn some extra money! &nbsp; #[Prolific]( Prolific is the number one site in this category for me. You take academic surveys for universities and researchers and get paid in cash. A great part of this is that academic research is actually regulated through universities\u2019 IRBs. This means that surveys have to treat you fairly as a part of their research. The researchers also have to follow Prolific\u2019s rules that protect participants. As long as you don\u2019t miss attention checks you shouldn\u2019t ever get disqualified. I usually have many surveys available during the week, and it is slower on weekends. Also, it usually slows down slightly in the summer because school isn\u2019t in session, but there are still many available. Most surveys pay at least minimum wage. When you first start off you should be very careful not to miss attention checks, because multiple rejections early on can lead to your account being banned. You can cash out via PayPal with no fees (for U.S. users). They used to operate fully in GBP, but surveys can now pay directly in USD which is nice! There is currently a waitlist for Prolific, and acceptance timeframes depend on demographics. &nbsp; #[CrowdTap]( CrowdTap is a great one for hopping in and out of when you have a couple of minutes. It is a great site for short polls and surveys that is available online and via a mobile app on iOS and Android! The questions are about things such as consumer goods, food products, and services. The surveys pay a varying amount depending on how many questions they are, if they contain open ended questions, etc. I think they pay well for the time committed to each survey and don\u2019t disqualify you. They also offer product tests and video interviews through the site that pay upwards of $50 so that\u2019s also available if that\u2019s your thing. They\u2019re usually based on prior surveys that you have taken. Reward options include Amazon, Target, Walmart and many more. You can cash out starting at $5 and I am able to cash out about once a week based on the number of surveys available. Some questions involve attention checks, so keep an eye out for those to avoid your account getting banned. One annoying thing is that the site no longer tells you how many points each survey is worth until you\u2019re finished, so you don\u2019t know if you\u2019re starting a short or long survey. &nbsp; #[PaidViewpoint (Non-Ref)]( [(Referral)]( PaidViewpoint is a site and app that has a variety of surveys, mostly about consumer goods. Most of the surveys take between 3-10 minutes, and they don\u2019t disqualify you. You start off taking short demographic surveys that pay $0.10. As you do this, you build something called \u201ctrait score\u201d. This is basically a measure of how honestly you answer questions, and as it builds you should get more and more surveys. As someone with a max trait score, I get multiple surveys per day. PaidViewpoint recently redid their website, and one of the best new features is that you can choose which survey to start, and it displays the pay and time to complete up front. It used to make you just do whatever survey was up next that they were offering you. You can cash out at $15, but after a few cashouts the limit drops down to $5. They offer Paypal, Amazon, Target, and more. After Prolific, this is my second highest earner, so check it out! &nbsp; #[Benjamin]( This is a new one this year for me! Benjamin is an app that could really use it\u2019s own post, but I\u2019ll focus on the aspects of it that fit into the purpose of this post. One of these is the daily login bonus. You get $0.05 for checking in each day, and can spin a wheel that can boost this up to $0.20 if you\u2019re lucky. It ends up averaging about $0.10 per day. There are also login streaks. About every 10 days of logging in, you get a login streak bonus that ranges from $0.50-$1.50 depending on how long your streak is. Also, you can connect a bank account/debit card via Plaid and earn a small percentage of cashback on purchases. The final way I have earned on here is by watching ads. You earn $0.01 per ad you watch. I often run these while multitasking because you do have to manually start each one. However, this can add up as you run them while doing something else. I have cashed out multiples times now for gift cards after hitting the $25 cashout threshold. &nbsp; #[Meta Viewpoints]( Meta Viewpoints is an app owned by Meta, the parent company of Facebook. I have been sent tasks such as reading sentences to train voice recognition software and giving my opinions on the Facebook platform itself. The types of tasks and surveys vary in content and also in pay, but don\u2019t take long. There are often multi-part programs offered that provide many tasks over the course of a few weeks. These programs come in waves, and there are times when I\u2019ve made $40 in a month, and times when I\u2019ve had no programs available. One of the major downsides to Meta Viewpoints is the lack of consistent work available. Meta Viewpoints automatically cashes you out to PayPal for every $5 that you earn. I have found the tasks enjoyable, and it is worth having in your routine for the times when many tasks are available. &nbsp; #[Influence/VoxPopMe]( Influence/VoxPopMe won\u2019t be for everyone because it requires recording yourself answering questions. These recordings are typically used for internal marketing purposes, and will indicate if they are being used otherwise. They ask things like where you shopped that week or your opinions on certain topics. I have had responses that pay anywhere from $0.25 to $1 and take about 30 seconds. You can cash out to PayPal at $10. It\u2019s definitely worth using if you don\u2019t mind being on camera! &nbsp; #[Bridge]( This is another new one for me, and I earn from it very similarly to Benjamin. For one, the login bonus streaks are great and I have earned anywhere from $0.02 to $0.50 just from logging in and spinning the login streak wheel. You can also earn cash bank on your debit card just like Benjamin by linking it to the app via Plaid. Finally, just like Benjamin you can watch 25 ads per day for $0.01 per ad. I have cashed out multiple times at their $5 cashout limit. I am enjoying the combo of Bridge and Benjamin for passive cashback, a great login bonus, and running ads while multitasking. I\u2019d check it out! &nbsp; #[Pinecone Research]( Pinecone Research is a fun one because you get to review real products and sometimes even test them yourself for real! You get sent surveys when they are available, and they take me about 10 minutes for $3. Sometimes I go longer between surveys, but this week alone I received four! I have gotten sent samples of pet and snack items, and then done a follow up survey to share my experiences. You can cash out to PayPal, Amazon, or a variety of other things at as low as $5. I\u2019ve been using this program for years now, and enjoy it! &nbsp; #[Cloud Research]( Cloud Research has gotten much better since I last made this post, and is basically a mini version of Prolific. They are academic research surveys that don\u2019t disqualify. I have also gotten bulk tasks for things like labeling images. The one I recently did had over 2,000 tasks available, and paid $0.20 per task. These new types of tasks are relatively new to the site. You can cash out instantly to PayPal and Amazon at $5. &nbsp; #[E-Poll Surveys (Non-Ref)]( [(Referral)]( E-poll focuses on surveys about pop culture. They have surveys that may ask you which TV shows you watch, which celebrities you recognize, etc. These surveys do not disqualify you, but can vary in length significantly. You receive emails when the surveys are available. There are a variety of gift card and PayPal options to cash out in. You get a better value on your points the more you save up. Check this one out if you enjoy pop culture! &nbsp; #[Be Forthright]( Forthright falls onto this list for a unique reason. Their surveys do disquality, but you get a substantial \u201cloyalty bonus\u201d for each survey, whether you qualify or not. For every three surveys you take, even if you are disqualified, you receive $3. This is about $0.66 no matter what happens in the survey. If you complete the survey, you still get paid the base rate on top of that. They have a variety of lengths, and the pay scales based on the length of the survey. You should avoid the partner surveys, because those do not have this DQ bonus. You can cash out instantly for a variety of rewards. &nbsp; #Google Opinion Rewards [(Android)]( [(iOS)]( Google Opinion Rewards won\u2019t be a huge earner, but it is very easy. This app is owned by Google and sends very short surveys that pay small amounts of money. You can cash out at $2. Some surveys are targeted based on location so make sure to allow location services. &nbsp; #OnePulse [(Android)]( [(iOS)]( OnePulse is an app that sends you very short surveys to complete. You earn $0.25 per survey starting out, but as you level up you get more per survey. I currently get $0.39. I don\u2019t do the non-paid surveys because they aren\u2019t worth the time, even though they do level up your account. The surveys can fill up very quickly, so make sure to do them right when you get the notification. You can cash out to PayPal at $20, but it only lets you cash out once a month. I get about enough surveys to cash out every month. &nbsp; #SurveyMonkeyRewards [(Android)]( [(iOS)]( Survey Monkey Rewards is an app owned by SurveyMonkey, which is a common survey platform. This app offers short surveys that can range from $0.25 to a couple of dollars. They usually take 1-5 minutes to complete. While the surveys can disqualify, it only happens towards the beginning of the surveys and still pays $0.10. I have noticed that the app sometimes has surveys available, but doesn\u2019t notify me. I recommend checking the app once or twice a day because of this. The app pays instantly via Amazon at $5. &nbsp; #[Amazon Shopper Panel]( I am including Amazon Shopper Panel on this list because it is one of the best receipt apps around. Warning, there is a waitlist so it may take a while to be able to use the receipt portion of this app. You get paid an amount per receipt based on the type of store it is from. Some categories pay up to a dollar, but even the lowest paying categories pay $0.15, which is very good for a receipt app. There are also very short surveys that you get sent. I complete one or two of these a month that pay $0.25 for 2-3 questions. As you might expect, this app pays in Amazon gift cards directly to your account at the end of each month. If you only use one receipt app, make sure it\u2019s this one! &nbsp; #[Streetbees]( This app has tasks that ask you about what products you use or other things about you. For example, I have a 4 minute task available to me right now that pays $0.25 to say what snacks I\u2019m currently eating. Sometimes these require taking a picture. You get paid via PayPal for each task that you finish. There aren\u2019t always tasks available but when there are, they often pay well. I had one for testing an app that paid $9! It\u2019s a nice option for something a little different than traditional surveys. &nbsp; Thanks for checking this out! I hope that this can help you earn some side money despite not having hours of extra time. Please let me know if there are any other programs that fit into this category in the comments below!"}

A note of caution with Benjamin. Following their nerf last month, their payouts became spotty and support became nonexistent. I had a great track record of cashing out with them, but since the beginning of July my gift card has been stuck in pending. I have created 7 support tickets, all of which have been closed without comment. I checked Google Play, and there are now a ton of 1-star reviews for this same issue, all within the last couple of months. Many are saying it took upwards of two months to receive payment. Since you can only have one payment pending at a time, they are effectively capping earnings at $25 per 1-2 months. They are also throttling ads now to limit the number you can view. It all has the feel of financial troubles that may eventually lead to closure. One other note: Bridge absolutely does reject people. I have tried several times to sign up with them, and was rejected each time without explanation. The last time I was told they will never accept me. No reason was ever given. ETA: One app I would add to the list is the MODE Earn app. They recently nerfed, but they do pay for things most apps do not. They pay a few cents to charge your phone, and also pay to listen to music. In addition they pay for opening emails, viewing written ads, and of course the usual assortment of games, surveys, and offer walls."}

They also asked if I used fingerprint ID or facial ID to log into my phone and/or Facebook or any social media. I've never used facial ID for anything. I did use fingerprint ID to unlock my phone, but haven't ever used it for any social media. I've now quit using fingerprint ID even for screensaver unlock. I think that was the issue. In fact, that same law firm referred me to another class action involving marketplace machines. It was one of those employee Cafe vending machines. They had no reason to look that close into every random person in the class action, so I called to make sure it wasn't just some flood the market thing because I was on their list. The service agent was very vague, and probably wasn't allowed to tell me, but they basically said I'd most likely definitely qualify, they couldn't tell me how they knew, but could confirm I was referred by \"FB CA lawfirm.\" It was also fingerprint scanning ID, and they were also saving biometrics, so I'm almost certain it was that. Edit: That (fingerprint and other biometrics), but probably a load of other erroneously/\"accidentally\" collected phone data they weren't supposed to be saving (or even collecting), but was still showing up in data collection somehow."}

Welcome to my guide for everything that paid me in 2018. Before I begin, here are a few details: * I do this completely on the side as a hobby. I have a job and am in school full time. This is just \u201cextra\u201d. * I don\u2019t really do passive video programs and I don\u2019t have a phone farm. Also, no mTurk. * I did not include referral earnings, and all of my earnings I included here are earned within the sites\u2019 TOS and without exploiting any site. * I only counted earnings as what I actually cashed out of sites and received. * My selection of sites I use is very diversified, so you can make a lot more on some of these programs than I actually do. I just spread my time across a lot of different sites. * There are a couple ref links in here and they are clearly marked as so. I only included ones for less popular sites and ones that give a bonus to you guys when you use them. If you want a ref link for sites like Swagbucks check out the common beermoney sites pinned post and use one of the links on there to help someone else out :) Now, let\u2019s get into the good stuff. *** #1. [Quickthoughts]( - $590 This was my top earner for the year and it only took me up until September to earn this amount. I had to stop because they require a W9 for anything over $600 and I was too lazy to file that. It is pretty similar to a traditional survey router, but I seem to have much better luck with not disqualifying here. I get paid $1 per survey but some people earn $2 per survey based on their demographics. Some people have issues with bans and getting locked out of accounts, so it is not for everyone. Because of this, it is important to cash out the minute you hit the cashout minimum of $10. There are both android and iOS apps but I highly recommend using android if possible because the iOS app pays in iTunes gift cards and the android app pays in Amazon gift cards. Overall, Quickthoughts is great if you are one of the lucky ones without account issues. *** #2. [CrowdTap]( - $270 This is one of my favorite beermoney programs of all time. You complete a variety of very short polls and questions about consumer goods, food products, and services. The polls pay 1.5 cents each and the short answer questions pay 10 cents each. There are other ways that they ask questions, including longer surveys that are a combination between the polls and questions. All of them are well worth it for the time that they take. Reward options include Amazon, Target, Walmart, Steam, Xbox, and more. You can cash out starting at $5 and I am able to cash out about once a week. Definitely add this one to your routine if you have not yet. *** #3. [Prolific Academic]( - $197.95 This one is great. Take academic surveys for universities and researchers and get paid in cash. As long as you don\u2019t miss attention checks you won\u2019t get disqualified. Some people get multiple surveys a day and others get only a few a week based on demographics. Many pay at least minimum wage. I could have made a lot more on here if I tried. Universally regarded as one of the most \u201cworth it\u201d survey sites so give it a shot! *** #4. [Pinecone Research]( - $138 + Ranch Dip and Dog Chews Pinecone pays a guaranteed $3 for 10-15 min surveys regarding opinions on new products. They also send free samples sometimes! You can cash out for a variety of gift cards or PayPal. I get about 1 survey a week on average. Pinecone is invite only so look for invites to sign up on other GPT sites as sometimes you can find them there. If you get in it is some of the best money you can make with surveys for the time you spend on it. *** #5. [Branded Surveys]( - $130 Branded Surveys has traditional router surveys. A major perk of using Branded used to be their generous daily login bonus. This has been reduced to 5 cents a day, so it might not be worth using this site for the login bonus alone anymore. They have a very high EngageMe rate at one cent per 3 videos if that\u2019s your thing as well! Payouts start at $10 via Paypal and Amazon. *** #6. [Nicequest]( - $120 Big fan of this one. Their surveys have guaranteed rewards even if you screen out and can pay up to $2-3 for like 10-15 minutes. Their currency is \u201cshells\u201d and each shell converts to about 7 cents. Installing their meter on your devices adds a guaranteed 5 shells per survey. If you add it to your computer, phone, and tablet you get an extra 15 shells (about a dollar) per survey. I just have it on my computer so I get 5 bonus shells. Cashouts are quick for e-gift cards and they also offer physical items. Saving up for larger gift cards typically gives you better rates. *** #7. [PrizeRebel]( - $107 PrizeRebel is your typical GPT site with a variety of ways to earn, but it is most well-known for surveys. They pay $0.80 per survey on the YourSurvey router and that is where a majority of my earnings have come. Lots of cashout options starting at $2. *** #8. [YouGov]( - $100 YouGov is a survey site/app that pays anywhere from $0.50 to $2 per survey. The best part of it is that you never disqualify. I get a couple surveys a week. Most of the surveys are about public policy, politics, or general opinions of companies. You get the best value for your points if you save up for the $100 cash out. They offer the $100 cash out in bank transfer and Amazon. The Amazon gift card option used to be a physical mailed card but now its an e-gift card so that makes it even better! They offer other gift cards but they are for smaller values at worse rates so I would avoid them. Available online, on android, and on iOS. *** #9. iMoney - $89 Get paid to download apps! The best thing about iMoney is that the apps always credit and you can get credit for apps you have downloaded before. That\u2019s not the case on most paid-to-download apps. Earn 15-30 cents per app and there are 3-4 new apps available each day. They offer Amazon and PayPal but PayPal has a small fee. Added this towards the end of the year and hope to make more next year. Might not be in the app store at the moment? Couldn\u2019t find a link to put in the title. *** #10. [VeryDice]( - $65 Roll dice, get points, redeem for physical items and e-gift cards. I get the daily spin rolls every day and watch their ads for more rolls. The key to VeryDice is saving up approximately 100 rolls before rolling to have enough to get the daily doubles bonus of $0.30. Worth keeping on your phone even if it\u2019s just for the daily spin rolls. Available on both iOS and Andoid. If you want to enter my ref code at sign up you\u2019ll get 30 free rolls :). It is 1319422. *** #11. [Forthright]( - $62 Sign up and receive invitations to surveys via email. Don\u2019t do their \u201cpartner surveys\u201d, they rarely credit and you can get stuck in an endless loop. Their non-partner surveys are awesome. They pay well for the time spent but they also have one of the best disqualification bonusses I have ever seen. Every three surveys you take, regardless of whether you disqualify or not, you get a $2 bonus. That is $0.66 per survey on top of its base pay regardless of whether you qualify or not. They pay instantly with PayPal, Amazon, or Bitcoin. *** #12. [VolKno]( - $55 Do you like movies? Then this one\u2019s for you. Watch, rate, and tag movie trailers to earn Amazon gift cards. Each trailer has three stages and after completing all three you will make 23.5 cents per trailer. One thing to keep in mind is that you need a physical verification card sent to a US address in order to activate your account. I completed basically every trailer that was posted over the year, so my earnings are a good estimate of what you can plan on earning. *** #13. [Inbox Dollars]( - $52.03 A pretty shit GPT site with a high minimum cash out. Not sure how I ever hit the minimum cash out here. Would not recommend. *** # 14. [Zap Surveys]( [(Ref for $0.75 bonus)]( - $52.03 There are three main ways to earn here: a 3 cent daily login bonus, 7 cent location rewards for opening the app when a notification appears, and surveys. If you\u2019re going to do surveys on here do relatively short TapResearch ones. The location rewards alone are why I use this app. The one negative of this app is that the cash out minimum is $25. Definitely worth having on your phone! *** #15. [PointClub]( - $50 This is a pretty normal survey site. They have a daily login streak bonus that can double the value of your surveys when you reach the max streak which can make a lot of them worth your time. I stopped receiving surveys, so I assume I\u2019m banned? So be careful with this one. Cash out minimums are $25 which is higher than I would like. *** #16. [Survey Monkey Rewards]( - $49.15 Another one of my favorites. Survey Monkey Rewards is a survey app created by Survey Monkey, a big name in survey development software. Surveys all take under 3-4 minutes and pay either 25 or 35 cents based on length. I almost never disqualify, and you can cash out instantly to Amazon starting at $5. Available on Android and iOS. *** #17. [Earn.com]( - $71.31 Earn.com lets people pay Bitcoin to contact you. I mostly received BTC to sign up for ICOs and airdrops for random tokens. They were aquired by Coinbase so there are changes to the program. They require a LinkedIn to make an account now as well (I think). If you can get into the program still it is pretty great! *** #18. [MyPoints]( - $45 This is a sister-site to Swagbucks. I have decent success with their surveys so I use it for that. They have some other ways to earn but I don\u2019t use them. If you have the same success with their surveys it might be worth using. *** #19. [MicroWorkers]( - $44.16 Basically a smaller and sketchier MTurk. Lots of short tasks with decent earning potential but you have to find the right type of tasks for you. I did the click, search tasks for a while. There is PayPal with a $9 minimum but if I remember right they mail you a physical card with a pin before you can cash out to verify your identity. Not for everyone but worth a look. *** #20. [SurveysOnTheGo]( - $43.30 This one is pretty simple. Get surveys on your phone, and redeem for Amazon, Visa, PayPal, and Starbucks! Surveys range from $0.50-$10. Some are location based and involve in-store activities. The more involved the surveys are, the more they pay. Don\u2019t expect a ton of surveys, but many of them are worth your time. Available on Android and iOS. Minimum cash out is $10. *** #21. [Survey Junkie]( - $40 This survey site is average at best. I am having less success with them recently because I can\u2019t be bothered to take a 20 minute survey for $0.90. The one benefit of this site is that they have a VERY small disqualification bonus. Some people do have success taking surveys on here and the cash out minimum is $10. *** #22. [E-Poll]( - $35 Another survey provider with no disqualifications! Woohoo! You receive email notifications when you have a new survey. Surveys pay $0.50-$2 and are usually not too long. They pay via a points system and you get better rates if you save up for the higher rewards. I cash out for Amazon, and they can take a long time to deliver rewards so be patient. *** #23. [MooCash]( - $33.60 MooCash pays you to download apps and then open them for 3 days once a day. I have gotten paid as much as $2 for a single app download. They don\u2019t always credit super easily so I would only try the better paying ones. You can cash out for BTC, Amazon, PayPal, and more. You can use my ref code (EHNPNC) when you sign up for some free coins. I think it\u2019s only available to the first 20 people. *** #24. [InstaGC]( - $33 This is a pretty basic and easy to use GPT site. Very low cashout minimums with lots of options. Check out LiveSample and YourSurveys for a good place to start on surveys. *** #25. [PaidViewpoint]( [(Ref)]( - $32.65 Short surveys with minimum PayPal cashout of $15. There are short surveys to collect demographic information that pay 10 cents. If you qualify for any of the longer surveys they can pay as much as $1.50. Surveys can be sporadic so just check the site once a day. Worth the time it takes to put into it. *** #26. [UserCrowd (UsabilityHub)]( - $32.40 UsabilityHub, now rebranded to UserCrowd, pays you to give feedback on websites and products. Each task pays anywhere from 10-50 cents and the minimum cash out is $10. UserCrowd is nice because unlike other usability testing sites you don\u2019t need to record your voice or screen. I leave it in a pinned tab on Chrome and get notifications when there is a new task. They can vary in how often you get them. I enjoy this one, give it a shot. *** #27. [OnePulse]( - $30 This app has very short surveys with guaranteed rewards. You never disqualify or anything like that. I get a notification that I have a new paid survey about once a week. Surveys pay 30 cents to start but as you \u201clevel up\u201d they become worth slightly more. Right now mine are worth 34 cents. Cashout is at $5 via PayPal. Available on iOS and Android. *** #28. [Watchback]( - $30 This is the best sweepstakes app I have used. You get entries into the sweepstakes by watching videos. Each video is an entry. I watch 10 videos a day and usually win either $0.50 or $1 each day. It pays via Perk points so it\u2019s a nice supplement to your Perk routine. If this keeps being so easy to win I should make a lot more with it next year! Available on Android and iOS. *** #29. [Dabbl]( - $30 I started using Dabbl towards the very end of the year. They offer short brand-sponsored polls and videos that pay anywhere from 5-20 cents. These are super infrequent and cashing out from these alone would take the better part of a year. Where I earn with Dabbl is their non-passive ads. You get paid 1 cent per ad so I run them when I\u2019m doing other things. It adds up. They don\u2019t offer Amazon so I cash out for Target. Cash outs are at $5. iOS and Android. *** #30. [Gravy]( - $25 This is a pretty fun game show app. To summarize the game, you pick a percentage that you think a product will sell out at, and if you\u2019re within the closest few people to the right percentage you win a decent little chunk of cash. I\u2019ve won once. You can buy discounted products on here as well. Go check it out, it\u2019s pretty addicting. My ref code is \u201cLeeves\u201d if you want to throw some bonus guesses my way :). *** #31. [KinIt]( - $25 Take short polls and quizzes and get paid 6-25 cents a day. The unfortunate thing about KinIt is that they very rarely have their gift cards in stock. When they have them in stock they have a decent selection. Still worth your time in my opinion. iOS and Android are supported. *** #32. Life Fun and Everything - $25 This was an invite-only survey panel that gives me a $2 survey once a month. Found it on some GPT site. *** #33. [Panel]( - $25 Install Panel on your phone and get paid for sharing your location data. They drastically reduced their pay rate recently so I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s worth it anymore. Previously you could expect to make about $25 a year. *** #34. [Perksy]( [(Ref)]( - $25 Short polls that pay anywhere from $0.50 to $1. I get about one a week. Only downside is that the minimum cash out is $25. Various gift cards (including Amazon) are available. Definitely worth keeping on your phone. I think it\u2019s iOS only at this time. *** #35. [Swagbucks]( - $25 One of the easiest GPT sites to use. Lots of offer walls and surveys. I don\u2019t make a lot here but basically just do daily search, daily poll, Swago, and SwagIQ. If I wasn\u2019t banned from their surveys for some reason I might make a little more. I use r/swagbucks from time to time to find easy offers to do. Overall, a decent place to start of you\u2019re experimenting with beermoney for the first time. *** #36. [Survey Mini]( )- $25 This app uses your location data and pays you 10 cents (sometimes more) to fill out a short poll about stores and restaurants that you go to. They recently added e-gift cards instead of physical cards so that makes it a lot more attractive to use! iOS and Android. *** #37. [IBotta]( - $20 This is one of the better apps that give you rebates on select grocery items as you shop in-store. If you buy a lot of groceries, there is money to be made here. They also have traditional online cashback portals and offers. *** #38. [Streetbees]( - $19 This app has surveys with a more personal and fun spin. You get paid via PayPal for each task that you finish. There aren\u2019t always tasks available but when there are, they often pay well. I had one for testing an app that paid $9! It\u2019s a nice option for something a little different than traditional surveys. *** #39. [AttaPoll]( - $15.29 Attapoll is a survey app that sends you more traditional router surveys (many of which are Cint surveys). You might disqualify quite a bit here depending on your demographic so I stick to the short ones. Payouts are via PayPal, Bitcoin, and Ethereum. PayPal starts at $3 (nice), ETH at $3.50, and BTC at an insane $100. On both Android and iOS. *** #40. [Smores]( - $15 Smores is an Android lock screen app that pays a flat $0.10 a day for unlocking your device once. Their non-passive video section pays a cent per 2 videos at the moment so that can be a decent earner as well. Cash out as low as $1 for Amazon and other gift cards. I was pretty inconsistent in my daily unlocks this year and hope to increase my earnings next year. *** #41. [Crowdology]( - $10.04 Very straight forward. Do surveys, get paid. Some people have success with this type of site, and others disqualify a lot. I would stick to any surveys under 10 minutes in length to avoid wasting your time. Cash out for Amazon or PayPal at $10. *** #42. [Achievement]( - $10 This app pays you based on your steps. I have it connected to Apple Health. It took me about 9 months to earn $10 and I am pretty active. Android and iOS are both supported. Doesn\u2019t run in the background or drain my battery from what I can tell so it\u2019s very passive and harmless. *** #43. [Gamermine]( [(Ref code for $1 bonus)]( - $10 This is a GPT site with a few offer walls. They have good EngageMe rates as well as a 5 cent daily bonus as long as you\u2019re making a dollar a week on offers on the site. This is basically the only truly passive income that I have made this year from running EngageMe. *** #44. Cross Media Panel - $10 This is a program through Google that paid you to let them have an extension on your browser and on your phone. They discontinued most of this program so I am no longer earning from them. Parts of this program still exist but I haven\u2019t looked into it much. Probably just worth skipping over at this point. *** #45. [Lifetap]( - $10 This app is just a garbage survey router now. It used to have some other short guaranteed-pay surveys. I wouldn\u2019t mess with this anymore. *** #46. [PayTime]( - $9.99 Paytime lets you earn money for your subscriptions by watching ads and answering a few questions about them. You can only cash out once a month because it is supposed to be used for monthly subscriptions. All they do is send you $9.99 via PayPal or Venmo once you watch 40 ads. The catch with PayTime is that you need to be a student at one of the universities that they support. Check their website for the list. Overall, if you are a student it could be an easy $10 a month. Hope to use this more next year. *** #47. [Ready Games]( - $9.19 Get paid to play games! There is a new game every 48 hours and the top 20% of scores at the end of the time period get paid. The top player makes $7 and the payout decreases as you go down the ranks. I have won somewhere around $2.50 every game that I have made it into the top 20%. Pays via PayPal when you win. On Android and iOS. You can use share code \u201clucky-disk-68\u201d if you want to give me some extra lives :). *** #48. [Carepoynt]( - $7 This is a pretty bad healthy living/rewards site. I think they had a few easy ways to earn, like downloading their app, and that\u2019s how I cashed out. There was a post about it so be looking for opportunities like these on the subreddit. I won\u2019t be using this again. *** #49. Amazon Shipping History Task - $6 Look for tasks like this that get posted on the subreddit. Got paid to submit some shipping data from Amazon. *** #50. DailyWin - $6 This used to be a scratch card app with a non-passive video section but it seems to be dead. Move along, nothing to see here. *** #51. [CitizenMe]( - $5.97 Take short polls. Get instantly paid small amounts of money via Paypal. Pays in GBP so if your currency is USD you get to take advantage of that increase in value. Polls are spotty but worth it due to the instant payout (so no minimum or anything like that). iOS and Android. *** #52. [PollPass]( - $5.15 Answer polls and get paid! Pays via PayPal at $5. Very simple and fun to use. Just answer the polls whenever they are available and watch the points add up. Added this at the end of the year so hope to expand on this next year. *** #53. Brand Insights Polling - $5 I honestly have no clue how I got paid by them. I think I took a survey that I found from a Facebook ad or something? *** #54. [CashForApps]( - $5 Get paid to download apps! They don\u2019t pay the best and sometimes have a hard time crediting but still might be worth a shot. The very best paying apps pay around 30 cents. Some pay pennies. Available on iOS and Android. You can use my invite code \u201c4848a6\u201d and get a few free points. *** #55. [EarnWallet]( - $5 This was a from a promotion that was posted on r/beermoney for just downloading EarnWallet. Check out the sub for opportunities for occasional promotional opportunities like this. *** #56. [Shopkick]( - $5 Scan items, check into stores, and earn cash back for buying certain items. Not a huge earner but can be fun to mess around with when you\u2019re out shopping. Available on iOS and Android. *** #57. [Louder Rewards]( - $5 This app paid $5 Amazon to download 5 apps and use them for 3 minutes. It was a one time offer so I don\u2019t use it anymore. It\u2019s on iOS and Android. *** #58. [Qmee]( - $4.68 Install their extension and get paid a few cents for random searches that you make. They also have surveys. I use PayPal to cash out and there aren\u2019t any minimums that that\u2019s cool! *** #59. [Google Opinion Rewards]( - $4.68 This app sends you occasional very short surveys from Google that pay 10-20 cents. Using Google services and being mobile seems to increase the number of surveys that you get. Some people get a lot, some get less. Worth just having on your phone. The iOS app pays via PayPal and the Android app just give you Google Play credits. *** #60. [College Pulse]( - $5 This app has polls for college students to take. I think you need a .edu email address? Their rewards kinda suck so I stopped using it but they had an offer to cashout for $5 bitcoin to the Ben bitcoin wallet so I did that. Maybe worth it depending on what reward options they have at the time. Android and iOS. *** #61. [Fetch]( Ref Code For $2-$5 Bonus: XE2XG - $3 Scan receipts and get paid. I get 2.5 cents per receipt on average. They also have products that you can get rebates on when you buy (sorta like iBotta). They only accept grocery store receipts. A good addition to your receipt scanning routine. *** #62. [Quick Survey]( - $1.61 See my section on iMoney. Very similar but with less apps available and larger fees. *** #63. [CoinOut]( - $1.02 This is one of the most straight forward receipt scanning apps. It pays 1-5 cents a receipt (typically 2 cents). Cash out starts at $1 for Amazon or PayPal which is way lower than most receipt apps. Very nice. Hope to earn more with this next year. Has both Android and iOS apps. *** #64. [Indeed Job Spotter]( - $1 This app pays you $0.50 per sign to submit help wanted signs that you find around your city. I have never actually submitted a sign but got paid $0.10 per sign to verify the validity of other people\u2019s signs. I\u2019ve seen people make pretty decent money on here. *** #65. [1Q]( - $0.25 This one seemed cool at first. Take short polls, get paid $0.25 instantly via PayPal. The problem is that I never get polls anymore. Others have had the same experience. You might be able to squeak a few cents out of it. Android and iOS. *** # **TOTAL: $3014.92** Hope this helps you guys out, and if you have any questions let me know! Let me know what I should add to my routine :). Thanks to everyone who contributes to this subreddit because I found many of these programs thanks to you! Have a great 2019!"}

Perksy after I hit the $25 I basically got no surveys, I would be curious if the same happened to you. Dabbl has been much slower for me too, but finally made it to $5. Maybe check out 20/20 panel, kind off like Pinecone but with higher paying studies if you qualify. 1Q lol, yeah I think I made a quarter from them too.

About two months ago Paypal banned me. When I say for no reason I mean it took HOURS searching message boards, reddit, and various forums to finally figure out what happened. Apparently my info on PayPal didn't match the info on PayPals community forum. I used an alternate email address. I'd had issues logging into PayPal via app and wanted an alternate way to contact support via the community portal. Two weeks later I couldn't login to my account because it was \"under review\". So I tried to get answers on the community forum. The second I logged in I was booted, received an email notifying me my account is fraudulent, and could appeal the decision in 9 months (pos 6-9 months Id have to check). I tried calling but of course my account was locked so no way to get passed the robot. Had a $3.00 balance (thank God it was so low) so I got 7 days to access my account and transfer funds back to my bank (all other functions were frozen. No purchases, transfers to anyone, or access to the community forum to ask questions). I called cust service right after, fumbled through options to reach anyone alive and got hung up on. Called back and got a new msg saying the account cannot be accessed (click). I considered trying to set up a new account, but my info (bank, name, SSN, etc) is tied to the old \"fraudulent\" account. I dont want to risk more accusations of fraud. So that's where I'm at. You can tell me I should have known how serious an alternate email is and it clearly violates paypals terms (I've heard it plenty). All I'm saying is have a backup for any financial service you use regularly. When it's gone it's gone and sometimes you barely get a reason."}

But if they pay reasonable, most still disqualify you from the survey before it's finished. It leads to much wasted time and frustration. Most survey sites that I liked in the beginning even turned out like that. I do think that the more colorful life one has, more experiences, professional lives, international travelers, etc. may do better. A lot of Survey sites include the gaming. I'm not a gamer, so that didn't work for me. They make you get to many levels to cash in on them. So if you're a natural, there's that, I'm guessing. I bail quickly on things that waste my time. User testing and other website testing sites kept disqualifying me or didn't have anything to offer. MTurk nickel and dimes you, and I've only been eligible to attempt about 15 of the same cheap tasks out of 300 to 600 they have available. MicroTasks has a couple thousand quick tasks. Also a lot of nickel and dining, but some go to about 3 bucks. You have to finish in 1 min. to 10 min. and the tasks can be confusing figuring out before you've lost half your time. I process things slow, so that's not helping me any. Best sites for me personally: PAIDVIEWPOINT. They deliver the surveys to your app that you are pre-qualified for. Several a day during the weekdays. PROLIFIC. I personally was accepted in about 3 days. I get several psychological, sociological, and other questionnaires daily. You can accept anything they give you, that will be based on the long profile you fill out. High paid ones I'm getting started on ($10 to $250 per task) are DSCOUT and MINDSWARMS. Those you have to take pre-qualification tests to be accepted, and it depends on your personality and experiences."}

Ive got a few CC\u2019s but credit limit isn\u2019t that high And I really don\u2019t like or want to use them but a little just to keep building my credit back up. I got them to be more of a safety Net. I got invited on Amazon into the Vine program. Which is where you can request and be sent certain items free, Just have to leave a review in return. It\u2019s not paying me anything though, unless I sell some items after a certain amount of time . Plus they will get u for the estimated tax value. So I\u2019ve made sure to keep it under $600 Also, I found a Product tester site, (forget the actual name right off ) just ran across it days ago . You have to get accepted into it, but you can get some pretty nice electronics to test! And then keep. A friend of mine over the few year\u2019s his been part has gotten a IPad, and recently a IPhone as some of his bigger ticket items I known off . Anyway, I really need to go through and read the best posts in BEERMONEY that will help me make , even for starters an extra $200 a mnth would be nice. Has anyone even written a really good tutorial on what to do to make the most? Doing surveys for basically $3 an hour by time your done isn\u2019t a good way. Your info you left is pretty helpful"}

Spend your latium for speed ups as needed, not resources. Definitely invest in the research and building for new ships though, you need pretty high level ships to get decent quests awarding speed ups and resources. Be active in your alliance as sometimes members are generous and send you gifts. Do all the daily quests you can, as well as the field training. The mining quests are decently easy but you should try to go off the beaten path and pick a system that an early quest doesn't send you to. There's players that hang around those common systems and like to destroy new players while they're mining. Don't attack another ship for a mining spot because they might seek revenge, and it's pretty easy for them to find you if you took their spot."}

Recently I've posted about some great new apps/sites to help you earn money online and I recently found a new one that I think you'll all appreciate. Do note that this app is for people who are 18+ since it does involve nudity. # Introducing Instant Nudes Instant Nudes is a new app on iOS and Google Play that pays you to grant the app access to your camera. The app pays you $10 per day that you have the app installed and have the camera access granted. The app claims to be searching for nudes on your camera and every day they detect any some sort of genitalia, they'll deposit $10 into your account at the end of the day. [Here's my payment proof]( If you're reading this and you're sketched out about needing to send the app your nudes, I actually have found that while watching porn you can just point your phone your computer screen for a few seconds and eventually it will detect genitalia and you'll receive the $10 for the day into your account, which you can actually cash out instantly! From their site: > Every day millions of people send/receive nude photos for free. There is a lot of data that is collected from your nude photos, because every time you take a nude photo it is being watched by your personal FBI Agent. If you\u2019re okay with your FBI Agent seeing your safety square, why should you not be okay with Instant Nudes seeing it? The site does bring up a good point. How is your data protected? From the sounds of this, it really isn't reassuring at all. Do note that the app will have access to your camera 24/7, so what I did was install the app on a secondary phone that I don't use and I'll only use the phone when I'm watching my daily porn for the $10. # [Link to Site]( # Conclusion Of all the passive methods we've seen on this subreddit, from running ads on phones to receiving text messages to linking bank accounts, this is the first app that requests access to your camera 24/7, and by far to me seems like the most intrusive app, but if you play it right you could find this app being a very easy $70/week money maker as long as it lasts and works like it does now! Feel free to comment any questions you may have about this app. Since I have used it for a couple weeks now I probably can answer your questions. Otherwise I think you can contact support on their site."}

We didn't have a price point so my goal was to make sure I had more than enough to cover it. The amount I've earned throughout the year has enabled me to buy so many things I would never have done without r/beermoney. This includes fun things (flowers for my wife, Paper Mario for the kids), household items (vacuum, computer monitor), bourbon, and more. Knowing that the PS5 was bought completely from beer money earnings and not household funds, it makes the gaming that much sweeter. That's especially with the tough economy this year. Thank you to all of the users past and present! My primary income sources this year: Prolific, dScout, and User Testing. QuickThoughts was good while it lasted with $3 surveys but I got banned a total of 3 times so I'm done with that one."}

(2021) - No Disqualifications!", "content": "#Beermoney for Busy People! (2021) Hi! I try to make this post each year about sites that don't have DQs and are worth your time to use even if you have a busy life! I have removed sites and apps that no longer exist and have also added a new one I am using this yea! I am a full-time student and work while in school so I don't always have time to grind out surveys for hours at a time. To qualify for this list, the sites can't DQ and have to be worth your time to use! Hope these help! Let's get into it. &nbsp; #[CrowdTap]( CrowdTap is a great site for short polls and surveys that is available online and in a mobile app on iOS and Android! The questions are about things such as consumer goods, food products, and services. The polls pay 1.5 cents each and the short answer questions pay 10 cents each (converted from their points system). Some of these polls are combined into longer surveys, and some are single one question polls. All of them are well worth it for the time that they take and there are no DQ\u2019s of any sort. Reward options include Amazon, Target, Walmart, Steam, Xbox, and more. You can cash out starting at $5 and I am able to cash out about once a week. Make sure to give quality answers and look out for attention checks because people have been banned for not giving quality answers. Definitely add this one to your routine if you have not yet. &nbsp; #[PaidViewpoint (Non-Ref)]( [(Referral)]( This is a site with short surveys and no DQ\u2019s. There are short surveys (10ish questions) to collect demographic data that pay $0.10. As you do these, your trait score increases. Having a high trait score makes it more likely to get high paying surveys. You have to be patient, and you might go weeks without a survey, but once you get to max trait score it is definitely worth it. I have a max trait score and I get at least one survey (if not more) per day. The real surveys that aren\u2019t just for demographics can pay upwards of $2. You can cash out at $15 via PayPal, Amazon, or Walmart. Just as some inspiration to stick with it, after hitting max traitscore I am on track to make $150 on here this year! &nbsp; #[Pinecone Research]( Pinecone is a great survey site with surveys about consumer products and food that don\u2019t DQ and pay $3 per 10ish minute survey. I get an average of one a week. They also sometimes send you samples of the products to review and I have gotten several of these this year! The catch is that you have to find an invite to join the panel. These can be found on offers or banner ads on GPT sites so keep an eye out for one! It is well worth your time to sign up. You can cash out for PayPal and many gift cards at a $5 minimum. &nbsp; #[Prolific]( This one is great. You take academic surveys for universities and researchers and get paid in cash. I have been getting tons of surveys on here right now about Covid-19. As long as you don\u2019t miss attention checks you won\u2019t ever get disqualified. Some people get multiple surveys a day and others get only a few a week based on demographics. Usually it slows down in the summer because school isn\u2019t in session, but they\u2019ve had a lot of surveys available this summer. Many surveys pay at least minimum wage. Pro tip, if you ever have a problem with a survey or miss an attention check that you noticed, try contacting the researcher and often they can fix the problem for you. You can cash out with PayPal with no fees (for U.S. users). &nbsp; #Zogo [iOS]( | [Android]( | Invite Code: 88W6A Zogo is an iOS and Android app that pays you to learn about personal finance. It is backed by a variety of established banks and is actually quite interesting to learn through. While in the past it required a sponsor to be able to cash out, now anyone can earn in the app. You earn by answering a set of questions once daily through the \u201cpineapple party\u201d (the name for their currency). You earn pineapples based on your performance. You can cash out for a wide variety of gift cards such as Amazon and Target at $5. It is fun and worth it because you are learning valuable lessons about finance as well! &nbsp; #[YouGov]( YouGov is a survey site/app that pays anywhere from $0.50 to $2 per survey. You never disqualify. I get a couple surveys a week. Most of the surveys are about public policy, politics, or general opinions of companies. You get the best value for your points if you save up for the $100 cash out. They offer the $100 cash out in bank transfer and Amazon. The Amazon gift card option used to be a physical mailed card but now its an e-gift card so that makes it even better! They offer other gift cards but they are for smaller values at worse rates so I would avoid them. Available online, on android, and on iOS. &nbsp; #[E-Poll Surveys (Non-Ref)]( [(Referral)]( E-poll is a survey site with surveys that don\u2019t DQ. They send you surveys via email when they are available. The surveys are often about pop culture, TV shows, and celebrities. Some of them pay better than others for the time it takes to complete them, but most are well worth your time. Make sure to complete the surveys soon after you get the email, because some fill up within a day or so. You can cash out for several gift card options including Amazon and Starbucks. You get better rates with the higher valued gift cards so I always save up for the highest ones. &nbsp; #[Be Forthright]( Forthright is a survey site with a nice twist. You sign up and receive invitations to surveys via email. I don\u2019t usually do their \u201cpartner surveys\u201d because they often DQ and you can get stuck in an endless loop, which doesn\u2019t really fit with the point of this post.. Their non-partner surveys are awesome. They pay well for the time spent but they also have one of the best disqualification bonuses I have ever seen. Every three surveys you take, regardless of whether you disqualify or not, you get a $2 bonus. That is $0.66 per survey on top of its base pay regardless of whether you qualify or not. The base pay for the surveys ranges from $1-3 depending on length, which varies from 10-30 mins. They usually take much less time than the estimated length. I get a non-partner survey about once every 1-2 weeks and made around $50 here last year with minimum time spent. They pay instantly with PayPal, Amazon, or Bitcoin with no minimum. &nbsp; #[Perksy]( Perksy is an app that sends you short surveys that they call \u201cstacks\u201d. These surveys generally pay anywhere from $0.30 to $1.00 and I get about one a week. You can\u2019t DQ from these and they only take a minute or two. The minimum cashout is pretty high at $25 but when you sign up you get a signup bonus that gets you pretty close to your first cashout. I am able to cash out about once a year. They offer a lot of different gift cards but the most notable ones are Amazon and Target. &nbsp; #Google Opinion Rewards [(Android)]( [(iOS)]( This one is quite popular and most of you have probably heard of it. This app is run by Google that will send you short surveys. If you have the app on iOS you can cash out to PayPal at $2, but on Android you can only cash out to Google Play balance. People who travel a lot or use a lot of Google services may get more surveys than others. I make $10ish dollars a year on here but I\u2019ve seen others make more. &nbsp; #OnePulse [(Android)]( [(iOS)]( This is one of my favorites. The app will send you \u201cPulses\u201d that you can answer for cash. The surveys start out paying around $0.25 each but as you level up your account they pay more. Mine currently pay $0.34. They have non-paid pulses that can level up your account but those aren\u2019t really worth doing. The minimum cash out is $20 via PayPal. I have made about $10 here just in the last week due to pulses about Covid-19. &nbsp; #SurveyMonkeyRewards [(Android)]( [(iOS)]( This is an app that is owned by SurveyMonkey, the popular survey development company. It offers short surveys that pay anywhere from $0.25 to $0.50 depending on length. The surveys take no longer than 3-5 minutes. They technically can DQ, but this happens very rarely and only at the very beginning of a survey. The nice thing about the surveys is that they use SurveyMonkey's survey software so they are consistent and easy to complete. While they do send notifications, earnings on here depend on how often you check the app because they don't always notify you. I try to check the app at least once or twice a day. You can cash out at $5 for Amazon with instant payments. &nbsp; #SurveyMini [(Android)]( [(iOS)]( SurveyMini is a little different. The app sends you surveys when you visit different stores to review your experience there. They ask you about your satisfaction with the store, what areas you bought from, etc. The surveys usually pay $0.10 and take about a minute, but some can randomly pay up to $0.75. The more you visit stores, the more surveys you will get. You can cash out at $10 but you get slightly better rates the more you save up. They offer e-gift cards such as iTunes, Xbox, and Visa, but sadly no Amazon. I am on pace to cash out for $25 twice this year. &nbsp; #[Amazon Shopper Panel]( This is a new one this year and has easily become the most worthwhile receipt apps out there. All you have to do is submit either 10 paper or email receipts per month to earn a $10 Amazon gift card at the end of the month. I have also received a short survey from them that paid in Amazon cards as well. While this app has a waitlist, go ahead and join. It only took me a couple weeks to get accepted. A dollar per receipt is extremely high for a receipt app! &nbsp; #[Streetbees]( This app has surveys with a more personal and fun spin. You get paid via PayPal for each task that you finish. There aren\u2019t always tasks available but when there are, they often pay well. I had one for testing an app that paid $9! It\u2019s a nice option for something a little different than traditional surveys. &nbsp; Thanks for reading! Hope these beermoney sites/apps help you make better use of your beermoney earning time! Let me know if there are any sites that I didn't include that would fall into those categories. Give my profile a follow for more beermoney related posts in the future!

Here is My List... Oh.. and Im back.", "content": "I'm Baaaaaaaaaaccccccckkkkkkkk. &nbsp; &nbsp; If you have joined this subreddit in the last year or so you might be wondering who the heck I am and why the heck im posting the monthly post this month. I dont want to make this post about me but will quickly explain. &nbsp; &nbsp; I joined this subreddit in early 2016. Often times it seemed that there was too may posts complaining about programs or begging for refs. I felt there needed to be more positivity... So in April 2016 I started a post that became a monthly thing.. I posted what programs paid me that month and others did too. The post became very popular and it was amazing everyone's activity &nbsp; &nbsp; Last year about this time personal tragedy struck and oct 4, 2019 had my leg amputated and ended up in a rehab nursing home for 9 months. The wonderful admins here kept the monthly posts going. And now that im back to earning again, they have offered to let me resume doing the monthly posts. &nbsp; &nbsp; If anyone wants more of an update on me I will reply to this post. But thats enough about me.. &nbsp; There have been many changes in the last year.. IM still getting back into the swing of things... But I started back up on August 31st and this is how I did &nbsp; How did you all do in September? &nbsp; &nbsp; Program|Sept||2020 Total| :--|:--|:--|:--| Mturk|$816||$816| Swagbucks|$420||$420| Mypoints|$200||$200| Prolific Academic |$51.33||$51.33| PhonePayCheck^2|$27.56||$27.56| ESPN Fan Advisors|$20||$20| :--|:--||:--| Totals|$1534.89||$1534.89| &nbsp; **FOOTNOTES** 1. Does not count Ref earnings 2. Registration is closed for this app &nbsp; This list also didnt include approximately $250 in earnings that were earned last year but not cashed out until last month. ALso did not include about $320 in earnings from selling resources (legitimately and not against TOS) on a game called nova.startfleet commander. Also the yearly total on swagbucks isnt correct as I was active with that even while in the nursing home. Its a much smaller list than in the past as Im still getting into the swing of things. &nbsp; &nbsp; Before we get into the FAQ I know the question is going to be... **HOW DID YOU MAKE SO MUCH ON SWAGBUCKS?** &nbsp; &nbsp; Maybe because I hadnt done any big offers in a year but there was an abundance of em for me Northone Bank: $120 Varo Bank: $46 Rise of KIngdoms: $42 Some VPN: $11 profit after subtracting the cost &nbsp; And then to show how insane I am... I hit $10000 lifetime earnings on Swagbucks which triggered a $150 bonus So thats that. Will also have a big SB month next month with that awesome Vuse offer they have going right now. &nbsp; &nbsp; So thats my list. How did you do in September?? &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; **FAQ** &nbsp; **I live outside the USA. How can I earn?** Unfortunately most of the stuff I do is either USA only or US/UK/CA/AU. So its hard for me to advise whats available to people outside of those areas. If you live outside those 4 countries I really dont have advice for you. And I dont have much advice for even outside the USA. &nbsp; **How Much Time do you spend with this?** Its Hard to quantify. I am in front of a computer ALOT but its not always focused on making money. I have games I play and have scripts that watch for HITs ON Mturk so if something pops thats good I switch over. Plus Im often doing multiple things at once. That said.. there are people who make more then me with less time. Im actually very inefficient. &nbsp; **Why dont you get a real job?** Health issues.. and I can nap at 1PM.. and I dont have a boss looking over my shoulder... and I can work naked (I dont.. or do I....) &nbsp; **You must have a ton of referrals to make that much!** All the totals above represent only personal earnings. I seperate out ref earnings. &nbsp; **OMG! You must cheat somehow to make so much!** I do nothing outside the TOS of any of the programs. I consider this income to be a blessing and wouldnt do anything to jeopardize that. Plus cheating just kills programs and defrauds the companies that are allowing me to make this income. &nbsp; **Do you have to pay taxes on all of this** Yes on most of it. There are some exceptions but the majority of this income is taxable. Most of these companies dont issue 1099s but that doesnt mean you dont have to pay taxes. Please consult a tax professional if you have questions on how to handle taxes on \"beermoney\" income"}

I signed up for Prolific, YouGov, Branded, and i've got a good system with gambit and swagbucks that's going good. And then i've been doing microsoft rewards and well...it's not amazing so i just do the daily set cuz it's satisfying to get the chest animation thingy after a certain amount of days.

I don\u2019t have the money to pay for a laptop because my phone bill every month is $155 a month for just me bc I have unlimited plan and with taxes this phone was $1300 wish I would\u2019ve known I needed a laptop before I got locked into a Verizon contract.

It is just a matter of time before they shut me down again anyway.($5 minimum payout, instant transfer to paypal) \\-Inbox Dollars: $30. Again, too tedious, I am done with them. That and the fact there is a $30 minimum payout, I find it too risky for shut down and they are sporadic on their payment cycle, but legit. \\-Swagbucks: $10. Tedious as the previous two, but seems the safest of the three I have mentioned so far (as far as no shutdowns for dumb reasons and there is a $10 minimum). Received payment to paypal in less than a week. \\-Clickworker: $0.33. I have submitted everything (and approved. even W-9) and have yet to get UHRS assessments (they wont show up even though I got an email notice). Only 4 jobs show up, random low paying surveys, upload images from same sex marriage ceremony, some recording audio thing, and $$$ for recruiting someone else. Without UHRS, I am pretty much crippled there. Payment has not processed yet and is inconsequential. I figured I would mention it to see if anyone else has had this issue. Prolific: $0.00. I have no idea what I have done wrong here. 5 weeks a member and not one task has shown up. Either I did something wrong, I am incredibly unlucky, or something is broken. It has been disappointing because I have heard such great things about it and seeing people making some good money on it. I am perplexed. Mturk: $50.18. This has been the most efficient money maker for me so far. I started on the 16th, did a few jobs (slow at first as it can be a task in itself getting used to it). Got my first deposit of $4.70 into my bank account then went full steam ahead. $45.18 deposited yesterday to my bank account and already have over $25 waiting for the next deposit and I am only 2 days into my pay work cycle (had some hits finally catch up with approval as well). I am averaging $10 a day on this platform. Total for September: around $136 I am open to suggestions on the Prolific/clickworker situation."}

Happy to see you back!! After 5+ years of doing this thing I'm sort of winding it down as I work from home because my hours have been a little intense since the pandemic and I'm not as motivated to earn extra money anymore. September is always a really good month for me and this was no exception. I'm getting close to my 1000000 goal on Swagbucks and should have it in hand when November starts just in time for Christmas purchases. Here's my break down for September: **Swagbucks** $185.00 **Qmee** $164.83 **Playground Community** $16.50 **Pet Pawtal Panel** $50.00 **Disney Panel** $10.00 **Kids Messenger Panel** $5.00 **Survey Misc** $5.00 (+ electric toothbrush) **The Bowl** $17.00 (+ some cereal) **PrizeRebel** $50.00 **Health Hub Panel** $16.00 **instagc** $19.00 **OmniShopper Panel** $2.00 **Connected Life** $5.00 **Catalyx** $30.00 **Acceleration Panel** $10.00 **Advantage Research** $1.00 **Peacock Study** $100.00 (Amazon) **GP Think Lab Panel** $5.00 **YouGov** $100.00 **AutoMob Panel** $5.00 \\---------------------------------------------------- Total $796.33 $386.50 Amazon // $409.83 Paypal I've been able to do so much more having this extra money every month. Built 2 computers, bought several game consoles, bought way too many video games, bought a 4k Tv, helped me buy a couch, paid my credit cards off, helped me purchase groceries some months, helped me pay bills other months, bought an ipad pro, bought a few Apple watches. There has just always been extra Amazon money on hand and I appreciate the past 5 years of help beermoney has provided me. I started in July of 2015 and I'll probably keep going while I work from home July 2021 but I expect to earn less and less as we head into January."}

I used to make $30-50/week on it, but life is getting busier and I don't really need the beer money I make. Honest answer is I just do it without paying much attention to survey length or price. I used to do a ton while at work in between other tasks, while watching TV, while sitting on the toilet... There is a streak you can achieve that slightly increases payment by completing one survey each day for 5 days in a row, then one every day after that indefinitely. I've kept it going since I committed back in April. If you don't fit the demographic it can be harder to find surveys, but I apparently do and can typically find something at any time. That doesn't mean I don't get booted right away from even more. I just keep chugging along. It really came down to my motivation at the time."}

I\u2019ve tried inbox dollars and the pop ups were terrible and they spammed me several times and it took me a week to make $5 and I took surveys for hours a day. So inbox dollars is out. And while Swagbucks is legitimate in paying me, it takes forever to make money on there for me. I wish opinion outpost would go back to normal. It really pisses me off when I spend 45 minutes of my time on a survey that supposed to take 20 minutes (and give well thought out quality answers) and the pay is $1.10 and when I submit my answers after 45 minutes it collects my answers, doesn\u2019t pay me , and says \u201cthis survey is extremely popular blah blah blah\u201d.. ok.. wish you would have told me that 45 minutes ago."}

I pay $155 a month for just my phone. My actual plan is $80 plus fees and taxes (unlimited) + $17/month for total mobile protection which they MADE me get the first month and I haven\u2019t been able to cancel unless I go to the store + the rest is my phone finance payment and taxes. That\u2019s a lot for one phone line. I\u2019ve thought about selling my iPhone XR because I don\u2019t need it but I\u2019m scared that if something happened to this phone then my luck total mobile protection would say they couldn\u2019t cover it and then I wouldn\u2019t have a phone to fall back on . I calculated how much money it costs for me to pay for 2 years with Verizon including activation, upfront fees and taxes on the phone plus my monthly payment and it adds up to a whopping $3,900 I love that I\u2019m able to get the newest phones but I miss paying $45 a month for unlimited with straight talk lol . I guess on the upside Verizon gave me Disney + for a year and the Verizon up rewArds are less than subpar. Also got a free year of Apple TV with my iPhone purchase that I never watch. Almost $4,000 for 2 years of service is a lot of money compared to bringing a paid off phone to straight talk. Like say I took my iPhone XR to straight talk for 2 years... I would only be paying $1,080 versus $3,900. But at the time my financial situation was way better"}

For example, with swagbucks, I try really hard because although I did say ii'm 20 and I can't change it, but they do allow 13+, whereas branded surveys I don't focus on as much, it's more just checking in, doing a survey or two and hoping I eventually get to cashout. but i'm just trying a bunch of websites to see which one works best for me.

I have 19 more months left. I paid off my iPhone XR that was $900 after fees and taxes to get the iPhone 11 Pro Max. If I would have known then what I knew now I would have just paid my XR off and kept it because it\u2019s in mint condition. I still have my iPhone XR just in case like if something happened to this phone even tho I pay for total mobile protection insurance every month. Definitely wouldn\u2019t have gotten this phone if I knew my financial situation was going to drop by as much as it did. Thankfully I\u2019m still able to pay my bills and groceries and pay for necessities & also stuff like my Hulu Live. I did have to cut some things out of my life though - spending $16 a day on coffee, spending money every day multiple times a day at drive thrus, going on fewer vacations, and going back to my natural hair color as a professional was $230/month. So I\u2019ve had to cut out quite a lot but am still able to pay my bills and I\u2019m grateful for that . I\u2019m tight on money but I\u2019m making it work somehow. I always do, just had to cut out the lifestyle of being able to impulsively buy stuff whenever. *sigh*"}

I have spoken positively about this app before (at least when they were paying) but recently this second half of the year, they have STOPPED paying mystery shoppers. A quick glance at their Trustpilot reviews would tell you all you need to know. In my frustration to get paid, I connected on LinkedIn with a few people who work at BeMyEye to request for some help to get my balanced paid out, one of these people is the current CFO himself. I have since sent out a follow-up message (since the initial request was ignored by them all) requesting to be paid my balance before Christmas as it would be nice. The result of this is that I got blocked by one of them, and not longer than 2 hours later received an email that for the Christmas season we can \"complete more tasks in the app\" and in the process \"find gifts for our loved ones in the stores\". This was such a huge slap in the face from the company, and all I needed to know that it's probably going to be a much longer waiting time for the payout, if ever. Do not use this app!"}

A Thank You.", "content": "*Edit: big thanks for the silver and upvotes! These are my first ones so it means a lot! Hey guys. Just wanted to share my story as a thank you for everyone here. Almost 2 years ago I was working at a rather crappy call center at a job I absolutely hated, looking for little ways to boost my income. I was already an ebay top seller at the time as well but my sales had stagnated due to me having to work more and more at my job and I was wanting to work more from home due to the fact I had a kid. (Now 2 as of this year) I start browsing this subreddit one night at like 2am. Found some links and start applying to everything I can. Mturk, appen, brainiac, grubhub, etc. I also was able to find apps like Steady. 2 years later, I've gravitated to using primarily Grubhub and Instacart as my main income, Doordash for extra. Mercari saved my business pre-covid due to how much cheaper and easier to deal with it was. It sounds like a lot but I've started to almost double my annual revenue from my call center job and work maybe half. Are there tons of other stuff that works? Absolutely! I personally never could get stuff like appen or mturking to work for me, but I have friends who do use them and use them well. Are there problems with the apps? Ofcourse! A jobs still a job. But doing research into said jobs by applying and trying them out hurts no one but your own wallet if you don't at least try. Why stop here? As a result of all of this, I've actually managed to start getting certified in various cyber security and blockchain based techs and am looking for a new career. I also have learned my price tag and what im willing to deal with for what. Im also trying to plan a youtube series to help explain in great detail how these apps operate but im not very camera prone (always been the guy behind the camera) Like everything, you need to do your own research into certain things to understand where you need to direct your attention. I wasted a lot of time on some get rich quick things I've seen but ultimately I've gotten a stronger understanding of what works and what doesn't by trial and error and it paid off. Thats all I wanted to say, keep doing what you guys do and make that money!"}

If you did online surveys and made less than your internet bill for the month, would you argue that doing surveys wasn\u2019t \u201cmaking money\u201d and was actually just \u201csaving money\u201d because you had to pay for the internet?

Basically you can either factor indirect fixed costs in as overhead (like internet, or in this case, your groceries) or you can calculate them and assign them each to a revenue stream, but either way you get the same result when you calculate profit at the end of the year.

I've been meaning to make this post for a really long time because I think the number of people who call themselves 'broke college students' can really use some advice. I am currently a Freshman in college and while I've seen many posts on /r/beermoney in the past saying 'I'm a broke college student, help me make some money on the side!' but I've never really been able to relate to the actual concerns to respond to these questions coherently, or with the actual best options directly. Additionally, I've found that before I moved in to college, I remembered seeing a whole ton of 'student benefits/discounts' but now that I'm actually here it all feels really underwhelming, and I found it to be a struggle to find a full list of options. So that's basically what this post is going to be. I'm going to address as many concerns as possible, and I'm going to direct specific information that might fit your personal scenario... because there's a *LOT* that /r/beermoney users can do while in college to make life just a little bit easier. **NOTE:** *Before I start anything, I really want to make it clear that I am* **NOT** *an expert and I'm only good at recommending beermoney sites to people, I'm probably not that great when it comes to financial advice. If you're in need of financial advice, there are subreddits for that. Most of the examples or scenarios in this post are all just things I have noticed personally and may not relate to you. As always, if you have any specific questions feel free to leave a comment or send me a PM. I'll pretty much always respond to you.* # Table of Contents Section | Ctrl + F -------|-------- Two Types Of College Students | TTOCS Freebies For College Students | FFCS Student Discounts | SDSS Beermoney Apps/Sites For Students | BASFS FAQ | FAQS Conclusion | CONSE # There are two types of college students you'll find on /r/beermoney. (TTOCS) Chances are, if you're reading this post you'll fit into one of these two categories... ## 1. You are a student who has lots of student loans and you're trying to cut back on spending in every way possible. ## 2. You are a student who has little/no student loans and you're trying to get yourself into a good situation for when you get out of college. Depending on where you personally fit on that spectrum, you'll probably be looking for different advice, but regardless I think it is fair to say that everyone is looking for some additional money. # If you are person #1... Don't buy things unless you absolutely need them. This advice probably is just general knowledge, but it will really save you money in the long run. I'm going to continue writing this section with the assumption that you own a laptop of some sort. If you don't have a laptop, I'll honestly say that I believe that the *best* thing in the entire world that someone can invest in is a computer. I'm fully convinced that a person who owns a proper computer can be *significantly* more productive that someone who does not.... and that's not just in beermoney terms, that's in just about all aspects of life. If you are someone who opens up their wallet and literally sees nothing, beermoney possibly won't be the best option for you (as a standalone option), and you *really* should try to get a job while you're at college. If possible, I'd really recommend looking into any on-campus jobs that are offered by your college. My college in particular is really great at hiring people for jobs all over the place (even campus safety). It's also great to get a job on campus because the jobs offered by your college often will work with your class schedule much better than an off-campus job would. Remember that you're at school to get an education, and your school sees you as a student first while an off-campus job sees you as their employee, and they don't really care about your crazy schedule. I have a buddy who often will tell me that they really want to go out and buy some shit they don't need or go out to dinner at some fancy place, and I'll be confused because they'd have gone all week complaining that they have no money... and all of a sudden they want to go out and buy a bunch of shit just because. When I ask they'll usually respond with 'Oh, I just got paid today so I have money now', and they'll blow all of the money over the weekend and feel like shit all week long. **DO NOT DO THIS.** If you're new to beermoney, I usually like to tell people that money you earn from a job is 'real money', and money that is earned from beermoney is 'fun money'. Real money is money that you aren't allowed to fuck around with. Put that shit in a bank account and hold it for when you actually need it... or put that shit into investments or a savings account with interest. That money should be as untouchable as possible. Fun money is money that you earned just for the sake of having fun. Use this money to treat yourself every once in a while. If you're worried that you won't make enough from beermoney and if you tried only using this money as 'fun money' you would never have any fun, I wouldn't worry too much. I'm really confident that *any* college student in the US would be able to make at least $100 a month in beermoney, even if you have a busy schedule. As a point of reference, since I have moved in to college I have almost entirely stopped doing most of what I used to do and my earnings have dropped by ~85%, but I'm still not finding it difficult to rake in at least $200 a month. Again, assuming you have a computer, you could really benefit from using several web servicing sites such as Cambly, Usertesting, or other freelance sites. There's a lot of options for college students in the realm of 'testing sites', 'person to person communication/tutoring', and sites that allow you to sell your skills. A related sub might be /r/slavelabour. For example If you're a CS major you could put up an offer on slavelabour, or on the new /r/programminghelp and you could benefit yourself as you're getting better at coding, while also making a bit of cash. If you have any classes where you absolutely do not need your computer, you should consider passive options for your computer. [I actually made a really detailed post about passive sites that I'd highly recommend taking a look at]( You could also run this at night while you're sleeping. If you're someone who is dying for cash, one of the most popular money making methods for college students is to 'donate' plasma. This has always been pretty big. You'll probably want to google this one to see what options are available around you. I personally don't donate plasma and I don't recommend doing it frequently either. The place by me pays $20 for your first visit of the week and $50 for the second for a total of $70 a week donating plasma. Again, I don't recommend going frequently. If you're looking for ideas of what to/not to do for beermoney as a broke college student, feel free to PM me or read through some of the FAQs below. # If you are person #2... Don't float through college thinking you don't have to worry about a thing as long as you get good grades. If you don't have any student loans because maybe you're born into a wealthy family, or you have a lot of people supporting your education, or maybe you got a really nice scholarship, don't count that as a pass. I personally can relate to person number 2 a lot more, so I'll probably provide a lot of personal examples here. My brother and I are *extremely* different. Throughout college he would rely almost entirely on our parents to provide. If he wanted pizza, you better bet your ass he'd be paying with our parent's CC. I actually know a *lot* of people who are very similar to my brother. There's one girl I know who would go shopping for some new clothes at the local mall and she would go just about every week and when it was time for her to check out she would call up daddy and ask if he could pay her back for her unnecessary purchases (and she'd always get told yes). **DON't FuCKING DO THIS !!!** College is the time of your life where you *really* need to become independent from your parents. If you're not paying for your tuition or room & board or your access to the dining hall, that should probably be the limit. If you have never gotten a job before, now is probably the best time for you to get some experience. Currently I am a student host at my college and it's a pretty great job because it doesn't interfere with any of my classes. Basically all I do is host prospective students who may be interested in attending this college. It's a pretty easy job, and for $47 a night, I'm pretty satisfied. (And hey, if anyone reading this is a high school student and you're interested in checking out the 2018 #1 college in the midwest, feel free to request /u/Fishering and we can hang out all night! And yeah feel free to just google '2018 #1 college in the midwest' ;) not to brag or anything ;) ). Having an actual job will help ground you more as a person, all money aside. I personally invest all money I make from my job and make sure it all is kept safe. I'd suggest you try the same. Since you probably have some money to play around with, you probably have a lot more options when it comes to beermoney. I'd really recommend you take a look at the [FAQ]( for some things you could do during your free time. There are some things that I would really recommend you take advantage of... A lot of people around here will throw around terms like 'computer farm' or 'phone farm', and I'll honestly say that you should avoid 'farming' at all costs, but if you are someone living in a dorm where you aren't paying for your own electricity, you could really take advantage of this in a few ways... [Here's a post from a couple years back about 'free electricity']( Most of the responses on that post are just 'grow marijuana', which is pretty much out of question here, but it could be *very* worthwhile for you to consider mining cryptos. A huge site around here is 'Nicehash', and if you can get your hands on an ASIC, you can check profitability with Nicehash [on this page]( Just know that you won't have to pay the electricity each month, so that's more money that you could be making. Don't be afraid of 'spending money to make money'. # Freebies For College Students (FFCS) These are all some things that are absolutely *free* for pretty much all college students. * [Free 6 Month Amazon Prime Subscription (50% off after month 6).]( ~~You can also refer yourself/your friends and both you and the person you refer will receive $10 Amazon Credit~~ This has since been [discontinued]( * [Free Microsoft Office 365]( * Free checking accounts. See [Bank of America]( [Santander]( [Chase ($50 bonus)]( [PNC]( [Wells Fargo]( and more. You'll just have to google specific banks. * \"There's TONS of free food at campus events, especially if you go to a larger school. At my large school free food was easily available 3 times a week (usually pizza) and with some effort could probably be acquired every night. And if not, there's always www.freefoodguy.com \" ~ Added by /u/TubularJohnny * Check for what /u/TubularJohnny posts. He is truly the savior of /r/beermoney * More to be added as more become available/found. There's a lot of freebies out there than simply cannot be listed because they don't apply to everyone like these do. You'll want to check local offers around you to see what might be available to you. # Student Discounts (SDSS) There are a *lot* of student discounts you can find. I'm actually not even going to post any directly on here. * When it comes to saving money, I'd recommend you pinch a penny by checking out apps like iBotta for cashback, but also take a look and see if there's anything good on Groupon+, Uber Visa Local offers, Swagbucks Local, etc. * If you don't want to take the time to sort through specific offers, [I made a post about 'passive money saving opportunities' that will essentially save you money passively.]( * [Here's a list I found with 160+ stores that offer student discounts (October 2017)]( * \"As for discounts, is a great site for looking for coupons.\" ~ Added by /u/Mikazah * I have really found MyUniDays to be a great site for finding new student discounts/freebies. It also really streamlines the process. They have a confusing referral system. I'm not sure how it works, but [here's my referral link]( [Here's not my referral link]( * Textbooks are fucking expensive. A lot of people have found that you can have someone find you a PDF of your textbook over on /r/slavelabour for just a couple dollars. I'll honestly say that this is probably one of the best money saving methods for a college student. # Beermoney Sites/Apps *Specifically* for College Students Whew, here we go. This is probably one of my favorite parts of this post just because these are some beermoney methods that are really only meant for College students. * StudySoup - StudySoup is a site that allows you to take & upload notes for your classes. The banner on their site advertises \"$300 per semester\" for uploading notes. They have a referral system where both you and your referrer will receive $5 when you sign up and become an elite note taker. Worth checking out of you're a good note taker and if your school is accepted. [Ref]( | [Nonref]( * [PocketPoints]( - Pocket Points is an app that was introduced as way to forge you to pay attention in classes. The goal is to run this app while you're in class and you will earn points for not getting distracted by your phone. I actually cannot use this app myself, but from what it seems it is just an app that offers light discounts for stores that you probably have never heard of. * OneClass - OneClass is very similar to StudySoup, the concept is the same. You take notes and upload them. I'm not sure if you'd be able to use both of these sites since technically you give up the rights to your notes once you submit them. Both sites are very competitive for your notes, so it's worth checking out both. [Here's my referral link]( [Here's not my referral link]( * Discover It Student Card - I'm really not sure if this counts, but I'm adding it here anyways. The [Discover It]( Student card is now offering free $20 cash back for each year you hold a 3.0+ GPA while at college up to 5 years. If you want this card or have this card, that is a nice add on benefit. Note: It might not be safe to submit notes to sites like OneClass or StudySoup, according to what /u/HestiaX is saying... > \"I remember reading the comments of this post a while back and deciding not to upload my notes to any site. I'd check out your university's policies before doing anything and keep in mind the risk that you could be taking by not being careful.\" Please submit notes at your own discretion, and make sure to do your own research. # FAQ (FAQS) > **Q: Is it worth phone farming while in college?** **A: I was actually talking with Joe from the Tech Slugs about this and I think we both agreed that it is absolutely not worth it... unless you have remote access and you can just leave all your shit at home. Different schools might have different network policies that could prevent you from farming, getting banned is a concern, and honestly it's just fucking awkward getting asked what the fuck your phone farm is every day.** I'm too lazy to type any other FAQ's right now tbh. Will edit later. # Conclusion (CONSE) I'm pretty sure this is the second longest /r/beermoney post I have ever written. There's just a lot of words here. I really don't know what else to add to this. Just feel free to comment any additional information you might like to see added, and please do ask me any questions you may have! **[Subscribe to my Youtube Channel (steady stream of content will arrive late December....)]( **Here are a few of my other posts you might enjoy reading...** * [Lock Screen Comparison]( * [Passive Sites Comparison]( * [Receipt Apps Comparison]( * [5 Passive Ways To Save Money]("}

There's TONS of free food at campus events, especially if you go to a larger school. At my large school free food was easily available 3 times a week (usually pizza) and with some effort could probably be acquired every night. And if not, there's always www.freefoodguy.com 2. Avoid student debt like the plague. I had the choice to attend pretty prestigious schools with no financial aid (= 250k total cost of attendance) or my flagship state university on a scholarship. I chose the latter and ended up with no debt, and with enough hard work you can overcome the lower prestige factor to be on par with graduates from fancier colleges. For instance, many friends went to my state university undergrad, worked really hard, and got accepted to Ivy League grad schools, or got six figures jobs out of college alongside people from Ivy League schools. The only exception is stuff in finance, which tends to be a lot more elitist (but even here it's possible. Friends at my school interned at Goldman Sachs) The only large student debt worth taking these days is med school; business school and law school are only worth it if it's a top 10 school. And literally no undergrad major is worth a large amount of debt. As I mentioned, six figures jobs out of college are possible from regular schools, and taking massive debt for low paying job basically turns you into an indentured servant. 3. Internships over the summer a re a great way to make money. Avoid unpaid internships--I know they're standard in some industries, but your time is worth more than $0 an hour. They ought to be illegal. In my opinion, your time is better spent working on side projects and building skills in whatever your area is and earning money with a side job than an unpaid internship, but I'm just some guy on the internet. 4. Keep building skills that can add value, and putting yourself out there. Whatever interests you, get good at it and offer your services to others. Your pay will start low, but over time as you do good work it will grow and you can have a solid side income stream. College is the perfect time to get started."}

It can help your budget quite a bit by learning to cook for yourself. /r/cookingforbeginners /r/EatCheapAndHealthy /r/MealPrepSunday are a few of my favorites. Even just learning to cook some rice/pasta, grabbing a rotisserie chicken and a bottle of sauce to make a few meals can save you a few bucks a week easily. My favorites were pasta + ground beef (freeze separately and grab what you need) and chicken & bacon wraps (cook, freeze, then reheat in the microwave). 2. As for discounts, is a great site for looking for coupons. In college, I never had the time to sort through coupon sites or discount apps like iBotta; so that site helped a lot since I could just search for what I bought/planned to buy. 3. Also, Joanns has a student discount program. I think it's 10% off on top of discounts and coupons. At least, it was like that a few years ago when I had a card. Joann is pricey at face value, but they run sales and have 50-70% off coupons all the time which is great for any crafting or diy needs. Actually, a lot of crafting places or even specialty stores will have some sort of student discount program. It never hurts to ask. 4. Another thing, /r/churning can be good for paying for some things - assuming you're responsible with the cards. I wish I had gotten into it sooner because I frequently had to pay thousands of dollars for books/board/etc and could have gotten quite a bit of cash back."}

It's really more like $8500. I wasn't adding it all. The reason for that is that about $2000 is in mystery shopping merchandise - all purchased online. Of that, I managed to return $600 of it for cash, traded in another $100 for merchandise I'd rather have, and the other $1400 is hard to count as real income (although I expect the IRS thinks it is), because about half is stuff I can't use and don't feel like selling (like t-shirts and mugs with stupid sayings), so straight to Goodwill it goes and I'm not getting anything out of doing that. th other half is often usable but not items I would normally have bought - cheap earbuds, makeup, storage containers. So total cash is around $7,300. I'm just on all the usual sites. Started on Prolific in January (about $1000 total so far), then added mTurk ($1200), Clickworker ($2000), Appen ($1000), and Neevo ($1000) although it's been too slow lately so I haven't bothered. Tried Usertesting, Utest and a surveys app - all of which I only made about $25 on because I didn't love them. My general rules are nothing that requires being on live video because I don't care to do that. Nothing where they are expecting me to do a minimum number of hours (Appen has endless $10/hr jobs that require that). I either want more than $15/hr or want to do something fun (mystery shopping, surveys, grammar checking, moderation). I'm retired early so I'm just doing these jobs because I am too frugal and can't talk myself into spending money, so I try to think of this as free spending money. As far as I know, the most money to be had (steadily) is from being a Lionbridge rater. I believe that's $15/hr. You have to pass a test first that seemed pretty extensive. I dropped out of taking it when I realized they did have a minimum 10 hours per week. If you want steady $10/hr work that you can do whenever you like (as long as you do 10 or 20 hours that week), Appen is the one to use for that."}

Blackbox has metadata curators which you can find on the Blackbox Facebook group so you can collaborate with them to fill out your metadata for a percentage of revenue, usually 20%. These aren't employees of Blackbox, they're just like you and me, anyone from around the world, wanting to make some beer money! \\- If you want, you can even opt for full curation which means sending your videos to curators and have them edit, color grade, stabilize etc., and fill in metadata curation. This way you can focus on filming. It's a long-term process that takes a lot of dedication, discipline and up front time commitment.

It's just very random. I average about 22 sales/month there. Adobe is usually about $1-$3/week, as I have far less images there. For Istock, it's about $100/year. That's all entirely passive, though. I haven't added more images in almost 2 years, so I'm not \"up\" on the current trends or needs. I also never ventured into footage, those are all stills. My best sale last year was $80 and it was a woman standing on the shores of Lake Michigan with the steel mills behind her. I sold a pretty flower for $65 once. There are a few images I sell several times a week: my trans couple shots, an image of the American flag outside of a factory, and an image of a church steeple and the flag. The latter two are very versatile. I've seen them on Forbes and other news sites when they need a stock shot of an ordinary factory or manufacturing thing. My $100 sale was of a giant plume of steam coming from a plant in Ontario. An image I took of my son crying and clutching some chain fence sold really well during the border family crisis. He's white, but that didn't seem to matter."}

I thought this was too good to be true, but apparently not. For anyone that hasn't heard about this, [blockchain.com]( partnered with XLM, and are giving away $125 million in the cryptocurrency, $50 per person. I had heard about this before, but had quickly dismissed it as some useless crypto that wasn't worth claiming. Someone told me about it again today, and I noticed the currency is listed on both Coinbase and their Coinbase Pro exchange platform, meaning you can cash it out very easily. Here's how I did it and cashed the full amount with essentially no fees straight to my bank account: # Step 1 - Register with [blockchain.com]( and verify identity This process took around 5-10 minutes to complete. You need to provide them with a selfie beside your driving licence, and a close-up of the licence. After you complete this, the XLM should be in your account (it went in instantly for me). If it's not there, you might need to visit [www.blockchain.com/getcrypto]( Screenshot of funds received: [ # Step 2 - Register a Coinbase account and transfer funds there I already had a Coinbase account, so this was quick. You'll have to verify your identity here too, but they use an automatic system so there won't be any wait time for this. First, get your Coinbase 'XLM Wallet address' and 'XLM memo'. You can do this by going to the 'Accounts' tab on Coinbase, scrolling down to 'XLM Wallet', and clicking 'Receive': [ \\+ [ To transfer the funds out of blockchain, click on 'Stellar' on the side navbar, then click 'Send': [ Fill in the address details as shown and withdraw the max amount: [ The transaction came into my Coinbase account instantly. # Step 3 - Use Coinbase to exchange to PayPal First, go to Coinbase's exchange platform ([pro.coinbase.com]( Simply click 'My Wallets' at the top, click 'Deposit' and scroll down the currencies until you find 'Stellar'. Make sure you click 'Coinbase Wallet' tab, select the max amount and click deposit: [ Now you can use the main trading platform to sell the XLM for BTC, then from BTC to USD, or whatever your local currency is: [ \\+ [ \\+ [ Go back to 'My Wallets', hit withdraw, and withdraw the currency back into your main Coinbase wallet. Then, on the main Coinbase platform, click on 'Settings', then 'Linked Accounts' and link your PayPal account. You can now withdraw the funds by going back to 'Accounts', clicking 'Withdraw' beside the currency, and selecting your PayPal account. Payment received: [ \\+ [ &#x200B; Summary I know this is out in the open already and has been for a while, but I feel a lot of people might have dismissed it when they saw it was crypto like I did. I just wanted to share how easy it is to cash out for those unfamiliar with these platforms, as $50 is an extremely juicy amount for doing next to nothing. Enjoy! &#x200B; EDIT: It is extremely important that you enter both the XLM Wallet address AND the XLM memo when making the transfer to Coinbase. You will lose your funds if you do not provide the memo along with the address, I've seen several people make this mistake in the comments."}

So this works, it does, nothing sketchy has happened with that. Got the money in the first part. Read comments about how converting takes some of it away. But got approached by a redditor (I'll leave out name for now since I'm waiting to see if they'll reply by morning) who offered to exchange an almost equal USD amount for the crypto amount I'd gotten from this promo. I asked why, they gave me a detailed explanation as to why they wanted this currency over the money. After more talking back and forth I felt comfortable enough to send it and gave them my paypal info in exchange. He said he had to \"monitor the transaction\" before he sent money but that was six hours ago and thusfar I have not heard back. I must also note, I saw him giving money to others for a similar thing and it seemed legit altogether. But now I'm not so sure. So if anybody offers you money for this just don't do it. I'm stupid and now probably lost one of my only shots at food money this week lmaoooo rip me. Stick to it and go to the trouble of converting it yourself. Losing a few bucks for the conversion is worth the safety of it. If I don't hear back by the end of tomorrow I'll come back and update with the name of this specific person just so everyone is aware. EDIT 1: This person approached me privately and not over comments of this or any other post. And to be fair I just now saw the scammer warning. Not looking for sympathy either, literally just posting an extra warning for anyone looking into this."}

It makes testing conditions less \"realistic\". From this standpoint, people who lie in intakes to underplay their health problems are probably exerting a corrective effect on this system to some extent.

That is also investing in yourself, in your physical and mental well-being. That said, when you're desperate for cash, sometimes that's actually when you need the flexibility to explore your options. SB doesn't pay a lot, 100 points a day is just a dollar in a single day, that's just $30/month. Probably $25/month given where the cash out levels are and that it's not easy to meet your goal every single day. That's the thing. I can make $25 in a few hours on Rev. I think the most I ever made in a day there was $90, and I also try not to stress or kill myself too much for this stuff. That's three months of your beermoney income in one good day. But I'm willing to admit, Rev takes a lot more mental and emotional energy and attention than mindlessly clicking through SB does. So say you only feel up to doing it one day a month, but on that day you earn a modest $25, probably transcribing something 40-60 minutes long. (It takes longer than that to type, obviously.) That effectively doubled your month's beermoney income with a single day of effort. Or well, I don't know what Bing pays, but I think my mom told me she gets like $10 every two or three weeks? It's another slow earner. Which is fine. I like to have the slow earners on the back burner too. Of course, not everyone can do Rev. If your disability involves deafness/HoH or carpal tunnel or something, you may be SOL there. But there are other things that likewise pay more than SB does, with a bit of effort to worm your way into them. Doing all of them is probably not feasible, but just having one or two higher earners can make such a difference. For me, Prolific has the best balance of \"pays well\" and \"not too stressful or time-consuming.\" That's probably the #1 one I'd recommend if you're looking for an easier way to get more income. For reference, what they've paid me (all converted from GBP into USD, as it was deposited from Paypal into my bank account): Aug 2020 (so far): $89.51 July 2020: $110.10 Jun 2020: $107.02 May 2020: $112.73 Apr 2020: $136.48 Mar 2020: $74.66 Feb 2020: $63.06 Jan 2020: $58.46 Some months are better than others, but if I absolutely bust my ass on SB I might get $50, even a bad month on Prolific is better than that for me. YMMV depending on your demographics and whether you opt into things like deception studies and studies that use webcam and stuff. Then there's the stuff that invests in future income. For some people, that's going to look like degrees or certifications, but that's not the case for everyone. For some of us, it's spending time researching new money-earning sites, or \"leveling up\" in them so you get access to more opportunity. There are some skills that can eventually lead to income, but don't pay right away. For me, that's stuff like writing, illustration, and graphic design. There's a short-term financial cost to focusing on one of those, but a long-term financial cost to never doing it. I also love to code but I'm so bad at it that I wouldn't try to do it professionally, that's obviously an area where I could make money if I developed more. Physical fitness pays me nothing when I do it, though pre-covid I was able to make some money modeling and being in great shape probably didn't hurt that any. Someday maybe I'll be a personal trainer or a yoga teacher or something, you never know. It never hurts to have skills, even skills that don't seem profitable in the moment. Even if you're thinking, \"I don't do any of that stuff, I don't have skills like that,\" just stuff like blogging or vlogging can turn into an income stream. Anything you like to do can be a topic for those, you can review the movies you watch, talk about self care. If you like to cook you can make cooking videos. If you have a cat you can make cat videos. All of that's high energy, that's not going to be stuff you do every day. But every now and again, it's good to put out tendrils."}

Being homeless is in itself really stressful, and it's pretty well known that homelessness and mental health crises go hand-in-hand. Back when I was homeless, smartphones weren't invented yet and while there was some beermoney stuff online, I didn't know it existed. I didn't even have a laptop, because laptops were so expensive and hard to come by back then. I'd had a big old brick of a desktop before I became homeless, that went into a storage unit and I had nowhere to plug such a beast in, plus try lugging around a beige cinderblock from 1998 that only does wired internet, no wifi card, and a CRT monitor. (This was badly outdated even then.) But I vividly remember logging onto library computers to post little bits of creative writing (I was doing it as stress relief/a social exercise, not to make any money) and catch up with my friends. People always give me bootstraps and tell me I should have been using that time to fix my life, but damn, I didn't have the wherewithal, I was just trying to stave off suicidal ideation at that point. So yeah. Homeless people desperately need some self-investment and joy. Something that's just nice and not about their homelessness, a moment of escape. Good hygiene was absolutely vital to me when I was homeless. The last thing you want when you're homeless is for people to be able to tell that you're homeless. You've probably passed a lot of homeless people you didn't realize were homeless. I'd go to the gas station with the cleanest bathroom first thing every morning to do all the hygiene it's possible to do in a gas station bathroom. Exercise is a mixed bag. I got plenty at some points using a bicycle as transportation or having to walk a lot. Sometimes I was physically exhausted or couldn't get enough food, so I didn't have anything extra to be burning on crunches, I'll grant. It depends on where you are with relation to other things. But I also have a chronic health condition that is greatly helped by exercise, and exercise can also help a lot with depression. If you exercised a lot before you were homeless, it can also be reassuring and return some sense of normalcy. On the other, other hand, getting all sweaty makes hygiene difficult if you don't have shower access. Some homeless people are fortunate enough to have a gym/WMCA/WYCA/community fitness center membership that has access to a shower. I had to go to a truck stop for $10 a pop, so I used that more sparingly. I never used bitcoin, personally, and most of the sites we talk about here don't pay in crypto. I actually am struggling to think how I would use bitcoin if I were homeless--I'd have to exchange it for fiat at some point, right? You can't buy essentials locally with bitcoin, you can basically only buy (mostly shady) things online, and you need a mailing address for those. Many homeless people have a friend who will take mail for them, but not all. Some have a PO box, but those are expensive. If I were homeless again in today's world, bitcoin would not be my focus, paypal would. I already have the Paypal cash card. Using that without a bank account is a decent option for people who are unbanked--which I'm not, but my mom is, and a lot of poor and homeless people in general are. If for whatever reason I couldn't get paypal, the next best thing is those Visa gift cards, but those are dicey. You have to pay $5 for the physical card itself, so it works best if you wait until you have $500 saved up in your e-wallet, which would take a while, and when you're homeless you're probably going to want that money sooner. You also need a mailing address, which has got to be nerve-wracking when you've spent god knows how long saving $500 for the thing and you're homeless. I'd probably just be sacrificing my future firstborn to Paypal, begging them to reinstate my account. In the US at least, water is free. You can walk into any McDonalds and get a cup of water for free, or fill up at the water fountain in any Wal-Mart or whatever. Food is also not the biggest financial hurdle for most homeless people, though I've had patches of food insecurity and food insufficiency. Food pantries aren't very quality, but they will feed you for free in a pinch. If you're documented, EBT food stamps are the easiest form of aid to get--good luck getting anything else out of Uncle Sam, but they usually won't let you starve to death. Some homeless people are so mentally ill or developmentally disabled they can't understand or seek out this process or handle other aspects of getting food very effectively, but these things also kind of impede beermoney earning. If you're undocumented, you can't get government help and that's tougher, but there's still the charities, and just y'know getting places to save recently expired food for you when they close. You can eat for free in America if you don't mind eating crap. I think other first world countries are fairly similar on most of this, though I can't say for sure. The developing world isn't a place I have personal experience with, but for poor and marginalized people there, I know the informal economy is really big. It's probably harder than it is here to get internet-capable tech at all, though I'd guess it gets easier every year. Here I can get functioning stuff out of the garbage or passed down from friends when people upgrade. Most of their money is probably made locally, doing things like selling stuff on the street, cleaning for people, doing day labor, doing childcare, doing migrant agricultural labor. You can see plenty of that in the US too. Ever see the guys standing around by the Home Depot who will install whatever home improvement you just bought for you for a reasonable fee? That's the informal economy at work. Just from posts I see on here, it seems if you're from a poor country, legitimate online opportunities are fewer, unless you have a marketable skill like coding, or knowing excellent English. A lot of what we hear about is people scamming, which is a different matter. Are the scammers desperate homeless people in India? Maybe, but somehow I always assumed they were more just regular poor and not that on the brink. Oh yeah, and since you can't cash out a quarter, it doesn't even make sense for homeless people to think in amounts that small. If I were homeless and grinding, I would be thinking something like, \"It's not like I'd be earning more doing something else with my time\" (which isn't necessarily true, even--informal economy in the US pays a lot more than swagbucks--but maybe I don't have the ability or wherewithal to do that at that moment anyway) and just sort of plug at it until I got somewhere. I would use the money to pay for essentials--busfare/trainfare, rideshare, or gas, something to keep my SIM card active so I can maintain a phone number, access to showers, laundromat, medicine and medical needs and any hygienic products needed, food to fill the food pantry gaps/make the pantry food a bit more palatable. I would probably try to get into a cheap airbnb or motel efficiency ASAP. From there, I'd have a bit more leverage to try for employment. Getting an actual apartment is harder than just getting off the street, but I could work towards that. Homeless people don't want to stay homeless, generally--and statistically, most experiences of homelessness last less than one year, though being homeless once makes you more likely to experience it again. I guess sometimes I feel weird about the \"check your privilege\" stuff, because I mean, I was that person, sometimes (depending on what privilege is being checked) I still am, but these very human needs do and did apply to me. I've read posts by people in third world countries about how they have \"first world problems\" too. Sometimes we're really not that different."}

I'm from Hungary and today I tried clickworker/UHRS based on your post (because I found out the others doesn't offer decent opportunities outside US or not at all to my location) and already made 15 dollars with about 1 hour training/qualification tasks + 2-3hr of actual work as a beginner (tried 3 different type of task) Actually Im happy! Definitelly good source to get a little beer money. Without any experiance I managed to made about 3-5$ per hour which is kinda low, not an US or EU rate but compared to hungarian minimal wage its not the worse as an extra source from home, with almost zero experience. Some task are not worth it at all, others are ok, you have a few to choose from. I hope I can improve my skills (error free rate) and my work speed, and master some easy task so I can make this rate higher to make some continuous extra money when I have the time and motivation. Only downside I found so far is that the payment structure, which is about a month delay, then it pay out every week, but if you not in a rush, it's shouldn't be a big problem. Thanks for the heads up :)"}

Lots of Turk things are things like looking at a picture and then answering if it has something like a streetsign in it. Things like that. There are also lots of things like surveys(some that pay pretty well) that take a good deal of time(like up to an hour). The issue is that on mTurk, there are loads of tasks locked out by people who haven't been doing an obscene amount of stuff. The stuff that you can now do to boost up your overall tasks completed are just...absolutely awful. Stuff that if you did it really well, you might make 2-3 dollars an hour and have your brain melt out your ears from boredom. The good stuff that is easier and pays well is all locked behind high successful completion of loads of tasks. I did mTurk about...5 or so years ago. At that time, if the tasks were good, I could make about 15 bucks in an hour of work sporadically doing surveys or some repetitive tasks that paid really well."}

It is a bit more professional than the typical /r/beermoney site. You work for \"requesters\" and they can approve or reject your submitted tasks, also known as HITs. You can earn a lot more money on this site than other typical /r/beermoney sites, but you need to pay attention to which jobs you accept. Not all HITs pay well. They do require some sensitive information from you for tax purposes. Not everyone gets approved to work here, and some people will be approved months or years after being rejected. \u2014 [Payment Proof.]( ^(*This site is international, but most of the tasks are only available for the USA.

You get paid to record your screen and speak aloud while performing a number of specified tasks. These tasks are generally related to testing a website or an app, but some tests may have you complete a survey, play a game, test new software, etc. At the start you may receive $3 sample tests, but after a while you will see $10 unmoderated tests. Moderated tests start at $30 per test, and usually require you to have a webcam. Payment arrives via PayPal exactly 7 days after your test is completed. \u2014 [Payment Proof.]( ^(*The site is International, but most earning opportunities are for US, UK, CA and AU.) >\u21aa Age minimum: 18 >\u21aa Offers: Usability testing >\u21aa Payout: [Minimum: None] PayPal >\u21aa Referral Incentive: None. >**TIPS:** >\u2022 Completing the unpaid surveys at the top may qualify you for additional tests. >\u2022 Make sure to follow instructions carefully, keep talking, and be professional. Keeping a high quality rating is essential if you want to receive plenty of tests. &nbsp; #Cash Back From Shopping Online These sites give cash back on your online purchases. Online purchases require you to click their affiliate link prior to shopping. Ebates US has in-store offers as well. In-store purchases require you to link a debit/credit card and to active the offer prior to shopping. Most of these sites are International, but your shopping opportunities may be limited, and you will only get paid in the associated currency. \u2014 [Ebates Payment Proof.]( &nbsp; >**TIPS:** >\u2022 Make sure to click on the \"Shop Now\" or \u201cGet Cashback\u201d button before adding items to your cart.

We recommend avoiding this site at all costs. \u2716 **[Paidverts]( \u2014 Shady owner, sketchy site. Keeps doing debt swaps (cash to BAP). Do not post. \u2716 **[Neobux]( \u2014 It isn\u2019t *really* a scam, but they operate as a pyramid scheme. There\u2019s money to be made online, but it\u2019s definitely not there. \u2716 **[MarketGlory]( \u2014 It does pay out, but the pay is absolutely ridiculous. The only way to make a decent amount of money is to have a lot of referrals, and referral whoring on this subreddit WILL result in a permanent ban. \u2716 **[MindSumo]( \u2014 Not actually a /r/beermoney site. It\u2019s only spam in this sub. \u2716 **[G2A]( \u2014 Scam/sells stolen keys. \u2716 **[Quickthoughts]( \u2014 Many reports of people being banned when trying to withdraw as of 10/2018. Do your due diligence before possibly wasting your time on this app. \u2716 **Sites with $100+ minimum** \u2014 These sites usually offer higher than normal payments for simple tasks, with a high minimum to cash out. They are *always* scams. \u2716 **Generic news sites** that pay you ridiculous amounts to read an article (two euros??) \u2014 Common sense should take care of this, but in case it doesn\u2019t, it\u2019s always a scam. The site is usually hosted somewhere in Eastern Europe, and you will never get paid. \u2716 **Free bitcoin sites/\"faucets/cloud mining\" (THIS INCLUDES QOINPRO)** \u2014 This is not referring to those video-viewing/task sites (although they\u2019re still paying fragments of a penny). I\u2019m talking about sites that give you 0.000001BTC to fill a captcha (freebitco.in, dailybitcoins). Admittedly many beermoney sites pay low, but don\u2019t even bother with these. Also: *Bitcoin mining is NO LONGER PROFITABLE.* If you're really so keen on getting bitcoins, doing so through an exchange is your best option.

I also love DScout but I just don't qualify for a lot, but when I do it's very high paying. example I just did a \"mission\" )(as they call them) and made $20 in about 12 minutes.

It's beyond annoying for how many ads you need to sit through just to redeem a few coins at a time, seemingly worse than most other apps that are ad-heavy. Many of their ads are a minute long, some even taking as long as a couple minutes. I get that all apps are nerfing their payouts with how the world economy is going, but i much prefer upping the payout threshold, similar to Cashwalk increasing to minimum 5K coins on iOS, instead of inundating the app with shitloads of lengthy ads. Walk Task isn't worth the time anymore."}

Oh my gosh! I'm SO excited you found our little startup! My name is Madison Jones and I'm the Director of Peers at Kindly Human ( )! BIG shoutout to the new Peer that helped me find y'all and THANK YOU to this poster!!!! This was amazing of you!!!!! First off: I'm so excited about all the new recordings I can't even TELL YOU! Thank you to everyone who's already submitted! I'm working very hard to process them all and really appreciate your patience! Secondly: I want to provide a little guidance to help your recordings get approved faster! Members really like it when the experiences are presented as stories with a beginning, middle and end. It feels more comforting and personal that way! So: Here's what my problem was, here is how it made me feel and how I dealt with it, and then end with a word of compassion for the person listening. Our Members usually search and listen to recordings from people who are going through the same thing as them! The last thing is, for legal reasons, nothing in your recording can be advice. So, I can't accept a recording that has a list of things to do to get out of depression, or health tips or referrals or anything. I'm super sorry to anyone who got their recording rejected :( I hate doing it but hopefully these tips are helpful! Seriously, thank you all so much. I haven't had these many recordings in FOREVER and I'm so excited for our Members to be able to hear all the new experiences ya'll are bringing!!!!! Ahhhhh!!!!!!!!!"}

And then I sat and waited for clients to get in touch with me, it seemed like a no-brainer, since there were so few walkers to compete with me in my area. And I waited, and waited... And what I realized is most people aren't going to go that far to look at a website devoted solely to dog walking. Anyone that needs a walker is going to just look around at who might be walking dogs in their neighborhood, and if they don't see anybody, they will approach whatever young person that lives on their block that looks like they need work or whatever and offer them the job--that's how I got my first client, and after that it was word of mouth, because I was pretty good at it, unless a dog was too huge for me to handle, which did happen, I was pretty good with the dogs."}

The pre-screener is not compensated and only used to determine if you qualify for a particular survey. -- I responded to that, explaining that I knew how it worked, and that doing an entire study was NOT a prescreener, and they responded with this: Karen Scott 1:22 AM (13 hours ago) to me Hello, Thank you for your message. We investigated your account and show that your account was terminated from survey 247725-1001. Unfortunately, once a panelist is terminated from a study, no points are awarded and the study cannot be re-accessed. We apologize for any misunderstanding and ask that you kindly await your next survey invitation at this time. -- So with no way to be reimbursed for this type of scam, there's no point in me continuing on their site."}

Since I wanted the entire 3000 out, I had to do 1000 points three times (instead of just 3000 once). Anyway, I sent 2000 to amazon., and I'll use the other 1000 on sephora. The process is cumbersome, and since I can no longer get cash, it's just not worth it to me any longer. I had to go back to survey notification to find the link to unsubscribe, because I couldn't find anything on the site itself. It's been a nice ride, but the changes and getting rid of the cash option has done it for me."}

I am SO glad I just happened to cash out a couple weeks before the changeover because I had over $60 sitting there. Then after the new site I had $9.50 (that 50 cents has been sitting there for years, because there's no way to access it with their old payout system) and I thought I was going to lose my remaining balance. Finally yesterday I got a measly one dollar for a survey and cashed out with an Amazon gift card for $10. They can shove the 50 cents up their ass. Huge disappointment.

I used to get a couple emails per week and I qualified for most.

So far, I've only been able to complete one and that's out of over 100 or so I've received. Also, the first time I cashed out to redeem points (old website), I was limited to the number I could redeem per day. It was a bit of an annoyance but I did end up getting paid via PayPal. On the new website, I tried to redeem two $10 Visa cards, because they don't offer PayPal anymore. I got an email confirmation on one but not the other. After a few days, I contacted them and got a boiler plate email back indicating issues and glitches with the new website and/or they put a hold on anything after the first redemption to confirm it wasn't fraud. They know my email. How could this be fraud? They're the one's acting shady not me. So after another week and I still had not heard anything, again, I had to contact them. The reply was that they have reached out to their redemption dept and are waiting for a response, thanking me for my patience. I still have 300 pts banked. As soon as I earn enough to cash out, I will and then I'll be done with these clowns, but at the rate I am able to actually earn points, I'll probably run out of patience before that even happens."}

For me, the new site doesn't work at all. The site dashboard will show 2-3 surveys and when I click the link it just goes back to the survey dashboard, there is no survey link. But they send me 20 emails per day about new survey offers, I click all of them and they all say the survey is already closed. NONE of the surveys I get emailed are ever displayed on the website, and none of the ones on the website are ever sent to my email, and none of the links work at all. They're spamming my email with survey links after the surveys already expired but they won't give me any working links for the current surveys listed on the site. And also I will not be clicking on any surveys that say less than 300 points, not happening, a pinecone research survey has always been worth $3, that's what it's worth to me and I won't take any less for my time on their surveys just because they feel it's worth less. Hell they have a randomly selected mail system where they give people CASH in hand in the physical mail BEFORE they even take a survey and they don't even have to sign up for it, but we're being screwed for being loyal users of their website. My friend got sent $10 just for free because Nielsen randomly selected her, and she never did the survey, just pocketed the cash, they just send random people cash in the mail and they won't pay people who actually take these surveys online."}

I havent tried to redeem since the website change but if they are still offering digital visa cards hopefully this helps and you can add your digital cards to google or apple wallets.

My guess is that Pinecone Research was bought out by some other company. They used to be dependable - if they sent you a survey, you qualified for it and you knew you would get paid if you completed it. That went by the wayside a couple years ago; now you never know if you'll qualify or not. But I agree, this new company is horrible. I can't login, I can't get a response to my inquiry that makes any sense, and most of the surveys I've attempted I don't even get a chance to be screened out of - it just automatically says I don't qualify.

I\u2019m definitely going to give ProductTube a try. In return, I recommend Dscout\u2014and don\u2019t worry, the live interviews aren\u2019t like walking up to a store manager and asking awkward questions about things you don\u2019t care about. Instead, you get to chat about something you\u2019re genuinely passionate about, which makes it feel way more natural and fun. Another one I like is Eyes on Global. It\u2019s a mystery shopping platform, and I mostly see restaurant assignments there. I\u2019ve done the Five Guys job twice with them and made about $12 profit each time.

So I thought I would just wait until a friend or family wants to buy something online, use the visa cards, and they pay me back in cash.

If nowhere allows multiple card payments then it seems almost fated that you will be left with some money on a card that you cannot use.

If I'm lucky I can make about $5 per month doing surveys. Playing mobile games is quite risky now. Most games will spam you with ads and some sites don't track your game progress. For example, I played monopoly, completed most tasks but didn't get most of my rewards. I emailed them with proof and they said they'll look into it but I never got paid. This is just from my experience and It may be slightly different in Asia as you're in a larger country. If you want to try the survey thing out, I'd suggest you get the FreeCash app. They have multiple survey partners."}

I am retired, and I do it to pass the time and for some extra grocery money for my elderly sister. When I was working, I used to make that in 15 minutes. It's pathetic and ridiculous. Panhandlers on a streetcorner make better money than survey takers. If you want online work, go on Indeed or Glassdoor and try to find some remote work. Your time is worth much more than the pittance survey sites want to pay these days."}

Also, idk if you're in the US, but those cards, e.g., Tremendous, Virtual PayPal, etc. can typically be used on the Walmart app as a payment method, and many can be utilized as such on other platforms like Target, Amazon, eBay, I mean the list goes on and I'm surprised that house having this much trouble with them. When in doubt, call their customer service numbers and be patient when doing so because almost always, in my experience, that solves the problem (and usually prevents it from arising again in future dealings with the same types of cards and their associated brands)."}

Here's what I've been grinding at to bring home 1000+ a month, this has been my best year by far doing side hustle type stuff. How I make 1000+ monthly while also working full time: 1. delivery gig apps (Uber Eats, Doordash, Amazon Flex) I was on the waitlist for Amazon Flex for over 2 years; it was so long I completely forgot about it until they sent me an email to respond if still interested. a word on Amazon Flex: their offer rates can surge depending upon various factors (all of these gig delivery apps are supply and demand based. Fewer drivers -- likely higher offers). Amazon Flex does this the most. In my area the routes I see are mostly 3.5 hours long for $79. I always try to get a surged offer but it doesn't always work out that way. I think I average about 300-400/month, because I only do Flex when I want to mix it up and do something other than food delivery. I also don't like sitting on the app hitting refresh constantly trying to snag an offer. A lot of drivers use bots even tho that's against TOS. It is what it is Doordash/Uber Eats: food and grocery delivery. Not my first choice for money-making but the money can be good. These apps are actually the most flexible for me. I try to Dash/run Uber Eats during 11am -1.30pm or so. My full time job starts at 2pm. Earnings vary but they both help me reach my 1000/month goal Surveys Academic-type Surveys Prolific -100 or so per month Atlas Earth 15-20/month. Took me months of grinding to get to this level Serpclix - running while Im at work 20-30/month 25 clicks 10/ month Miscellaneous Digital home internet traffic - 200/year -- paid up when you hit 50 Covid longitudinal study -- 100/year or so Apps/Side gigs I no longer think are worth it: mturk (site is dead) Respondology - social media comment moderation. Slave wage of 0.05 per comment, paid weekly ivueit - would rather do doordash Connect Cloud Research - a much lesser version of Prolific Caden AI - they NUKED their rewards payment for your data Datacy - I once was getting $2 every 10 days or so. Now? I'm literally get 7 or 8 cents. As soon as I can cash out I will and be done with that joke of an app. Any tokenized walking apps Swagbucks Qmee - insanely high DQ rate"}

If I get 10 good studies a month, it's likely that I've screened for 200 and felt I qualified for at least a hundred.

The stores are listed in the breakdown image. I don't include sites that take any receipt on my breakdown. *Note: Individual deals vary by user for most apps. If you don't have the deals right now, you can try checking back later.* &nbsp; ####My Guides 1. [All rebate apps/sites I use and/or know about]( 2. [How I do my hauls]( 3.

If you don't like what I buy, you can buy different products. If you don't like hunting for deals, you can do surveys, microtasks, games or whatever else you like instead. There is no need to discourage other users just because you aren't interested in the same things! &nbsp; If you don't need feminine hygiene products, toothpaste, soaps, etc - consider donating them to your local women's shelter, church, or school!

I've missed doing these hauls! I've gotten a couple deals here and there since my last post, but nothing worth posting about. I've been dealing with some issues that make doing/planning hauls a struggle. Unfortunately, that's not yet resolved so posts will be sporadic at best until things get sorted out. &nbsp; On another note, I got banned from Aisle. After multiple email attempts over the course of a few months, they finally responded once. They claimed I made multiple accounts using the same email, phone number, and payment account. I genuinely do not understand how that even could be possible. You just give them your phone number and do everything over text... You don't even *make* an account. I also only use one phone number. I tried to email them again a few times, but I've heard nothing back. Given that it's been over half a year now, and it's seemingly impossible to get this sorted out, I will no longer be recommending them or giving them free advertising on my posts. &nbsp; Anyways, on the other side of things, [I got a few more pairs of Zenni glasses for almost nothing. Thanks to everyone who used my referral this past year!]( This time around I decided to try out their migraine lens, and it definitely helps with the light sensitivity. Also, I am in love with their Oleophobic coating now. It's so nice. &nbsp; ---- &nbsp; ###Time Spent I planned my haul over the course of about an hour while also getting regular groceries. I took a lot of breaks though. I did a pickup order, so it only took about 5 minutes to get the groceries. &nbsp; I generally plan my hauls over the course of an hour or two while I eat breakfast/lunch and play with my pets. I usually spend around 45-70 minutes in the store, which includes my regular grocery shopping. I could easily cut that down to 30-45 but I like to take my time. &nbsp; ---- &nbsp; ###Food From Deals Here's some things I've made in the past: [High Protein Tomato Crackers]( [Hot Sausage Cups]( [Peanut Butter Fudge & Chocolate Hazelnut Fudge]( [Chocolate Cherry Pie]( &nbsp; Do you guys want me to continue showing things I've made using ingredients I got from rebate apps on these posts? Let me know in the comments, or [you can vote on this poll if you want to remain anonymous]( &nbsp; ---- &nbsp; ###Mini FAQ * If you're new or confused - check out the guides near the top of the post. They go into detail about *everything*. * I'm from the USA and these posts are tailored as such, but [this post of mine]( does list things from other countries that I know about. * My posts are tailored to being money makers to suit this subreddit. There are tons of great deals that aren't money makers but can still save you a lot of money. * A lot of what I get is given away to friends, family or is donated. I do this more as a hobby than anything. * I generally do not share my spreadsheet since the one shown in this post is not the one I actually use (it's put together with a script from my usual spreadsheet) and there are a ton of little things that will give you wrong values if you don't know about them and even then you have to be careful. It's super easy to make a spreadsheet with Google Sheets though."}

But I still wanted to try and help out where I can, so I dove into several side hustles to try and help contribute. I've always been physically active, and walk a lot every day (20k+ steps each day), so when I found out that some apps will pay you in gift cards or PayPal deposits for your steps, I checked out as many as I could since I already do a large amount of walking every single day.

There are most certainly additional apps, but these are the ones that I have experience with, I'm happy to learn of others if anyone reading this has suggestions. Hope this helps someone out there! \u2014 edits\u2014 I forgot to add a few things that have come up as questions from some of you: namely, my overall earnings, app functionality, my recommendations, and battery usage. App functionality: * at the time I compiled this list, all of the apps on here function as they purport; meaning, the apps on this list successfully pull my step data to the app from the assigned source device, the apps successfully and accurately convert my steps into their in-app currency, the boost and video ad features function properly and successfully enhance my rewards, and I\u2019m happy to report that I have also successfully claimed the rewards that each app promised from every app on this list. Now, that\u2019s not to say that I don\u2019t encounter bugs or the occasional app crash here and there. But by-and-large, the apps here are stable and operate the way they claim to. Battery usage: * there are a few battery drainers on this list. Whether they\u2019re pulling data in the background or just operate at a high memory usage on your device, I use the following apps while my phone is plugged in and charging to avoid significant battery drain: CashWalk (probably the worst offender), Cash for Steps, Million Steps, GeoSmile, MoneyWalk, and WalkWork. I should note that many of these have longer ads, with infrequent or unavailable ad skips, meaning you\u2019re sitting there for the whole 20-45 secs per ad, which definitely contributes to battery drain Earnings: * it\u2019s difficult to tabulate my overall earnings without tracking them on a spreadsheet, and quite frankly I don\u2019t have the patience or desire to do this, so these are estimates pulled from memory. I will say that I do use every app on this list (with the exception of WalkWork, I\u2019m phasing that one out) on a consistently daily basis. And, in a year, with moderate app usage (1-2 hours a day max) across all the above apps, I earn around $200-$300 in Amazon gift cards and PayPal transfers. My best year, I came just shy of $500 in gcs and transfers, and that was without vacations or other such events that prevented me from logging on these apps. Normal earnings levels are around the $250-$300 range, which is around $20-$25 a month. My recommendations: * I have a completionist mentality, and I tried a few times to max out the rewards and boosts I could get from these apps, but I quickly realized what a waste of time that is. To watch every ad and use every boost in every app on this list, you\u2019d be sitting on your phone for 4+ hours every day. That might not be a big deal for some people who don\u2019t have kids or are employed and want something to do to burn the clock at work, but for me and those like me with kids and a desire to live my life outside of my phone, that\u2019s just too much, especially when you consider that it becomes a daily chore. Nah nah, no thank you. So, after doing this long enough (about 5 years now), I definitely prefer the apps here that require the smallest time investment, which (with the exception of GeoSmile because you can opt to bypass the ads by taking a reduced reward - a nice feature if you\u2019re in a hurry) do NOT include any of the ones I mentioned in the battery drain section - Cash for Steps, CashWalk, WalkWork, MoneyWalk, Million Steps. I still use those apps, but I\u2019ve trained myself to be ok with not watching every ad on them. My favorites from this list would be WeWard, Macadam, Optimity, NoomVibe, Upper Edge Fitness, and Walkfi - limited/no ads, moderate payout threshold, ease of use Hope this helps!"}

Most of these will read your step data straight from Apple Health (which is what I use) or Samsung Health, but many have the option to pull fitness data from wearables like a Fitbit or Garmin type tracker. Without researching it, so going off of memory, I think the ones from this list that simply pull your phone\u2019s step data and do not sync with Apple Health or Google Fit or similar would be GeoSmile, CashWalk, MoneyWalk, and Million Steps. Realistically, no matter what phone you\u2019re using, watching enough video ads will definitely drain the battery, so I like to charge my phone while ad watching. The worst offenders from this list would be WalkWork, CashWalk, and probably MoneyWalk. After doing this long enough, I like the apps that require the least amount of video watching. I tried a few times just to test it out, to see how long it would take to maximize the rewards and boost for each app. That took way, waaaay too much time. You\u2019d be sitting on your phone watching ads for 4+ hours a day, which just isn\u2019t feasible for most people. So, that said, my top picks from this list would be WeWard, CashWalk, Optimity, and NoomVibe. The others take a little too much time to check in and make progress each day. Some others I like because the payout is instant or points accumulate quickly (if you have the time to do the ad-watching), and those would be GeoSmile, MoneyWalk, and Upper Edge Fitness. At this point, I wouldn\u2019t recommend WalkWork at all."}
