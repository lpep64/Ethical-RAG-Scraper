You'll learn to love talking with people, and people will love talking with you. **Skill #1 - A good listener doesn't listen to respond. They listen to learn.** \"Listening\" is not just \"hearing\". It's asking good questions that help you **understand** the other person. My girlfriend told me *\"I don't like it when you tell me how to do things. I feel like you're judging me.\"* *\"I'm not judging you.\"* I said. *\"It was just a suggestion.\"* **I was not listening.** Regardless of how I experienced it, her experience was that I was judging her. A bad listener focuses on explaining his own experience. A good listener focuses on learning about the other person's experience: *\"Which part makes you feel like I'm judging you?\"* *\"Was it what I said, or how I said it?\"* *\"How would you like me to make suggestions in future? Or would you prefer it if I didn't make suggestions?\"* A good listener improves the way he relates with the other person by learning how they think. Learning what's important to them. A bad listener learns nothing. At an interview for a sales job I was asked *\"How will you bring us 10 new clients in your first month?\"* I didn't have an answer prepared. I panicked and blurted out the usual ways of reaching new clients. It was an empty, generic answer. **I was not listening. Any monkey could've rattled off that list.** When the interviewer asked that question what he really wanted to know was: \"Does this guy know what he is doing?\" A good listener would've unpacked the interviewer's question and learned what the interviewer was looking for: *\"You know I haven't really thought about specific strategies. What's your biggest bottleneck right now in getting new clients on board?\"* A good listener aims to understand deeply. A bad listener misses the point. **Skill #2 - How to quickly find common interests (not the way you're thinking)** Don't get stuck in polite conversation. There's no \"skin\" invested in it. You've got to get at least a little bit naked (so to speak) in order to make friends with someone. Here's how you do it: We humans have just 4­-8 basic emotions, depending on which study you read: joy, trust, fear, surprise, sadness, disgust, anger and anticipation. Everything we experience triggers a combination of these basic emotions. There aren’t that many combinations. We may not have experienced the same activities, but we have experienced the same emotions. So when I say you need to find common interests, I mean you need to find something that sparks similar emotions ​in both of you. Say Felipe is studying to be an architect, and Manuela is studying to be a doctor. Felipe doesn’t care about medicine and Manuela doesn’t care about Architecture. They ask each other polite questions: *Felipe*: Oh I hear you have to study for a long time to be a Doctor. How many years do you have left? *Manuela*: Yeah, I’ve got another 2 years. 7 total. Although you never really stop learning. What do you want to design when you graduate? *Felipe*: Bridges. I mainly want to design bridges. But I guess I’d be happy designing anything. *Manuela*: Yeah I know what you mean, I just want to graduate already as well! This is pretty boring, right? Neither of them are offering or asking for emotional information. You need to make an effort to understand​ them. This chit­chat isn’t going to cut it. At this level of conversation they have to keep thinking of new topics every few seconds. The ideas will dry up pretty soon. This is why conversations often feel like hard work. It’s much easier to pause and explore one topic for a while. So here’s what you do... **You don’t just listen to respond. You listen to understand. You go deeper.** * Offer your own emotional information * AND dig for their emotional information. Keep digging until you understand their way of thinking. Until you feel the emotion they’re talking about. Then show them that you understand by sharing a similar experience of your own. These questions are your friends: * WHAT do you like about that? * WHAT made you want that? * WHAT scares you about that? * Essentially any question that uncovers “What makes you feel that way?” or “What makes you think that way?” WHAT tends to work better than WHY because WHAT feels like you’re curious and WHY can sometimes feel like an attack. “WHY do you like that?\" “Because I do. What's your problem?!\" So back to Felipe and Manuela. Now that they know how to “listen to understand”, how does their conversation go? *Felipe*: I mainly want to design bridges. But I guess I’d be happy designing anything. *Manuela*: What do you like about designing bridges specifically? *Felipe*: Well I haven't actually designed one yet, but for some reason I keep picturing myself standing on top of a huge bridge that I designed. I don’t know. It just makes me feel alive. *Manuela*: Yeah that sounds pretty cool. What do you mean by ‘alive’ though? *Felipe*: Hmm, well the bridge started as an idea in my head, and now I’m standing on it. It’s like having ultimate control over everything. *Manuela*: Oh I know that feeling! That’s how I feel when I think of saving someone’s life at the last minute in the emergency room. Boom… Doctor In­control. *Felipe*: Haha. Is that what made you decide to become a Doctor? Because you like feeling in­control? *Manuela*: Yeah, I guess it is. *Felipe*: Wow. That’s the same reason I decided to be an architect. So does that mean you hate it when other people boss you around too? *Manuela*: OMG that’s the worst!! I can’t stand it when other people tell me what to do. Fun! Turns out they’re both control freaks. THAT’s their common interest. Now they can geek out on that instead of churning through countless emotionless topics that they don’t connect on. **Skill #3 - How to never run out of things to say** Imagine you have a conversational D-pad. It gives you something to say whenever you run out of things to say. [These are the controls.]( Say you’re in a conversation about cars, and you don’t know anything about cars. You run out of things to say. What are your options? [Here's your conversational D-pad for cars]( Some people prefer to *zoom out*. They think and talk about general things: ideas and concepts. Some people prefer to *zoom in*. They think and talk about specific things: details and examples. You’ve probably had conversations with people where you just don’t click with them. It could be because you prefer to zoom in and they prefer to zoom out, or vice versa. **Example** *Elena*: How was your day? *Pablo*: Good. Productive. I got a lot done. How was yours? *Elena*: Well! When I woke up I made toast, with butter and vegemite. I left it in the toaster a little too long and it got a bit burnt, but I scraped it off with a knife and it was fine. Then I cycled to work. I went down Oxford Street this time instead of my usual route down Henry Cotton Drive because I wanted a change. My boss didn’t have anything for me to do today so I made an appointment to see the Doctor next Wednesday at 5pm and spent the rest of the day on Facebook chatting to Sofia about her baby, Ivan, who has a cold and Esteban about his new Porsche. Then I came home down Oxford Street again because it was so lovely in the morning. It wasn’t as nice in the evening. And now I’m talking to you. *Pablo*: So was your day good or not? *Elena*: I want to know what you did all day. Pablo likes ideas and concepts (zoomed out). Elena likes details and examples (zoomed in). Pablo is bored senseless by Elena’s details and Elena feels like Pablo doesn’t want to share things with her. Pablo is interested in the big picture. He wants to understand the point of what Elena is telling him. What does it mean? Did she have a good day or a bad day? Elena is interested in specifics. She wants to know what made Pablo’s day good or bad. What does he mean by ‘productive’? What did he get done? If you find yourself in a conversation that just isn’t working you might be speaking to someone who has a different zoom preference. All you have to do to connect with them is zoom in or out to match their preference. If they prefer to zoom in, give them details and examples. If they prefer to zoom out, give them the meaning behind your details and examples.

Turns out, it wasn't what I was saying it was HOW I was saying it. These small changes in how you speak can completely transform how people see you: 1. Slow down your speech. Nervous talkers rush their words. Confident people take their time. Speak like every word has weight. People will lean in instead of tuning out. 2. Lower your voice at the end of statements. Don't end sentences like questions? It makes everything sound uncertain? Lower your tone at the end. It signals confidence and finality. 3. Use fewer filler words \"Um,\" \"like,\" \"you know\" these kill your credibility. Pause instead. Silence shows you're thinking, not just filling space. Pauses make people pay attention. Because that way they understand you put effort into the words you say. 4. Stop over-explaining \"I think we should do X\" hits harder than \"Well, I mean, maybe we could try X, but I don't know, what do you think?\" Say what you mean. Period. Don't make it long but keep it short. 5. Match or mirror their volume If someone speaks softly, don't shout. If they're animated, bring energy. But always stay slightly calmer than them. You become the steady presence in the room. 6. Use definitive language. Replace \"I feel like\" with \"I think.\" Replace \"maybe\" with \"likely.\" Replace \"I guess\" with \"I believe.\" Own your words. The kind of words you use dictate the image people have to you. As much as possible don't swear especially in professional settings. 7. Don't fill every silence. Let your words breathe. When you finish making a point, stop talking. The urge to keep explaining shows insecurity. Plus the more you talk the more people will care. 8. Speak to the person, not the group. Even in group settings, make eye contact with individuals. \"John, what's your take?\" vs \"What does everyone think?\" Direct connection creates respect. Because the more you talk to everyone the less chances anyone will respond. What I noticed when I started doing this: People stopped interrupting me mid-sentence. My ideas actually got heard and considered. Colleagues started asking for my opinion instead of talking around me. I realized I was apologizing for having thoughts. \"Sorry, but I think...\" or \"This might be dumb, but...\" Stop apologizing for existing. Your ideas have value. Speak like you believe it. Practice this: Record yourself having a conversation (with permission). Listen back. Count the filler words, notice your tone, hear how you end sentences. It's eye-opening. Or just record yourself talking to yourself. It works either way. How you speak is how people think of you think (Perception). If you sound uncertain, they assume you are uncertain. If you sound weak they will assume you are not trustworthy. You don't need to be the loudest person in the room to command respect. You just need to sound like you respect yourself first. Keep learning. I had to learn this for years. Have a good day!

He never rushes to speak but as soon as he speaks we listen. I can’t remember if I’ve ever heard him say ‘I think’, or if he does it’s less often. Instead he often says ‘it’s possible that…’, ‘if i remember correctly’ (as well as ‘likely’). Now we don’t have a cutthroat team and everyone respects each other where I interact with him, so there’s that - but he always appears unflappable and as if he is devoid of any anxiety or uncertainty in himself - without appearing cocky or over confident. He comes off as if he’s just reading the answer from a textbook.

We went from elaborate scam to elaborate scam and no one would believe me that they were scams. It was a social psychology clinic. **THE FORMAT** We went to these middle-of-nowhere but well furnished facilities with equally well dressed salespeople (got to give the air of authenticity yo). The only other customers were tourists on similar tours. This is apparently not a red flag at all when I asked the other people about it. This was followed by a pitch and upselling products around 3x their market price (in the case of raw goods like pearl, silk, tea) or 10x their market price (in the case of arts/crafts). In two cases I literally said, \"I've been to Thailand, silk is actually really cheap\" or \"Pearls can be farmed easily nowadays and dropped a ton in price since a few decades ago\" days before the pitches and people still bought things at these facilities. Despite my vocal anger that we had to listen to scams for 6 hours a day many of my fellow busgoers were still convinced that their $15,000 jade and $5,000 teapot were good deals. Here's what I learned from ~24 hours of listening to these pitches: **HOW TO RUN A SCAM** * **Propaganda Effect** Even before you get to the store, the tour guide is wearing whatever they're about to sell and tells you why the pearls/jade/silk/etc in the region is special or cheap. You go into the facilities and the guide there corroborates the same information. There are museum-like signs on the wall that say the exact same thing. In the 30's a psychologist named Carl Hovland ran a study focusing on biased messages. He found that when people receive new information they believe is biased they may be wary to believe it, but over time the memory of the source of the information fades and the wariness disappears, especially if it's corroborated by different sources over the same period of time. It's actually how a lot of marketing fads work, you might not believe initially that gluten-free or juice detox works, but if you see enough information corroborating it, you will believe. * **You Guys are Smart, Aren't You?** Some presentations they show an obviously fake jade or pearl and ask what's wrong with it. When everyone answers \"it's fake\", the presenter acts impressed \"wow you guys are so smart\". Unfortunately she did not give us stickers to reward us for our intelligence. My friend Sam once told me that he found the best way to get someone to like you is to pretend you think they're smart, which I strongly agree with but fail to do like 90% of the time because I guess I'm an asshole. This technique also works really well here because it also reinforces the idea to these people that they are informed customers and can tell fakes when they see it, even though they have no fucking clue. * **Made Here** Every location has either an actor posing as a master or student crafter working in the middle of the sales area or the tour area, the noisiest, busiest area of the facility because that makes sense. Everyone coming into these now believes the goods are made on the spot. Clearly they're not though; there's no kiln where they're making the teapots, there's no dyes where the silk is being spun. Also did I mention they're making the stuff in the middle of the fucking sales area? This is usually combined with the presenter casually mentioning/reinforcing that handmade goods are worth more or talking about how long a piece took to make. Spoiler alert: it's never less than a year. * **Authority & Social Proof** There is almost always an actor that the staff pretends to respect and honor. In turn, the customers respect and honor the actor as well. In several places there are cards that talk about the master crafters who have been there for 70+ years or went to college for \"tea\" who just so happen to be in that day (\"you guys are so lucky!\") so they can impart their wisdom to you. I would like to know if they are so wise and respected why they have to work in the middle of the tour route, you'd think they could at least have their own office right? One location the staff even acted afraid of the master who was standoffish initially but \"noticed\" us on his way out and took an interest. Everyone laughed at his jokes and was quiet when he spoke. I was told by the tourists that I should respect him when I started talking over his presentation and was later shunned by other busgoers for it. Later some girls my age told me they felt \"pressured\" by him and I think a large part of it was because they believed they should respect/fear him like the staff did. They bought matching $500 jades. I later told the same girls that we could use the same technique to help me pick up girls (if they pretended to have the time of their lives with me at the club) and they told me \"that wouldn't work on us\" * **Liking Bias** I keep going back to this \"master\" but that pitch was by far the best. Studies show that for you to like someone initially the three biggest factors are: 1) They are attractive 2) They are like you 3) They like you I think the last one is the most important and that's the one a salesman has the most control over. The \"master\" took a \"genuine\" interest to us after being standoffish, asking us about where we were from and taking his \"valuable\" time to especially focus on the most important clients. I think that actor was most successful because he made us feel liked by someone who was \"important\". I mean, I didn't feel liked though. They actually wouldn't let me into the master's private office after I asked him if he could calligraph \"scam\" in Chinese so fuck that guy. * **Teacher is Always Right** The presenters almost always tells true things when presenting. They teach interesting new things like how silk is made, how jade is mined or carved, or how pearls are farmed. They tell you how to value pearls or jade by size, color, etc. so you feel like you're informed. They also give a demonstration that wows people: Real silk never burns. Green tea can clear red iodine (or some chemical that they use) from water whereas water cannot. Real jade scratches glass without scratching itself. Some of these are actually pretty cool. Even if you already know this, this further extends your trust in them. Because what they teach you is true, it's assumed that everything is true. * **Reciprocity** This is a small one, but we always got free tea, free gifts, etc. In the case of the previously stated \"master\" they got free palm readings. People have an extreme discomfort when they feel like they \"owe\" someone something. Marketers know this technique and do a soft version of it by giving free samples, but salesmen master it by giving a legitimately expensive gifts to high net-worth individuals. There's a trick where if you get a P.O. Box in an expensive zip code ($>1M average income) you can get free nights at hotels or free first class flights. These only exist in New York and California; I checked. While this subversion generally doesn't work nowadays, this is why guys learn to buy drinks for their intended targets at a bar. * **Chi, Detoxing, & other Bullshit** They threw these in for good measure: Jade apparently centers your chi, green tea can reduce the toxins in your body, etc. These are marketing/pseudoscience scams that you are likely to believe if you are their target market. **MY THOUGHTS** The most straight up amazing thing to me is that these people clearly had no interest in these products before because they clearly don't know how they're priced. After watching a short presentation they're suddenly inclined to blow hundreds or thousands of dollars on these objects. I think we cleared $30k on this trip between the 12 of us (I know because every purchase over $5k was followed by a round of applause which I actually find hilarious). I wanted to ask a few questions to these buyers like: * If these guys are master crafters whose work are worth thousands, and these are collectors items, why are they only selling to tourists in remote facilities? * How do you think they can afford to run these massive businesses if they are giving us a good deal on these products and their only customers are tourists? * Why are they building shit in the middle of the sales area? * If you agree that there is a chance this is a scam, why would you consider buying anything at all? * If this bus tour was a scam, what would they be doing differently than what they are doing now that would make you believe it's a scam? **Cognitive Dissonance** The most infuriating thing to me was that when I told some people they were being scammed they were angry with me. In fact I think in some cases it made them want to purchase more. After a somewhat heated exchange with one of the girls my age, she made the regretful $500 purchase. We saw 6 hours of presentations a day. I think for a lot of people they would rather believe they weren't scammed and spend hundreds more than believe they wasted their vacations. When some of them came to the light, they were also furious, whereas most of the others said they enjoyed their trip. For the captive audience I think it was more fun to believe that it wasn't a scam and consider purchasing something rather than be like me. Also, I think it's a blow to the ego to realize you've been scammed. I think most people would describe themselves as \"street smart\" since it's a way to feel smart that's ambiguous/hard-to-test and being scammed definitely wrecks that image. **Post Purchase Rationalization** Not really part of the scam, but after my mother purchased her 3x overpriced pearls (she actually did not believe me until she was told it was a scam by the bank when withdrawing money to pay). She justified it as donating to the local economy. The girl who spent $500 on the jade is convinced it's still worth $500, she just doesn't know why she bought a $500 jade. For some of the art pieces it was justified that they would \"appreciate in value\". I notice myself doing this sometimes too after making a poor choice or purchase and I think it's very natural for most people to do this."}

When you said 'In fact I think in some cases it made them want to purchases more.' You are correct. I forget the psychological term, but when you directly contradict a person's arbitrary idea that has no basis in facts (or weak perceived facts), often their reply is to 'double down' on that idea. Pride tells them they are right, and you are wrong, regardless of what you have to say or do. Here are some tips that may have helped you persuade the group you were with: 1. Get them to identify with you (of let know, you identify with them). Don't portray yourself as an all knowing person to the side watching the transaction between the scammers and those being scammed. ACT! and place yourself in the position of those being scammed. They will see you as 'one of us' as oppose to 'why does this guy have a chip on his shoulder over my actions?!' 1. Let cognitive dissonance work in your advantage. Speak out loud those questions that you 'wanted to ask' and mainly directed at the scammers. And not as an 'a-hole' in the crowed, whose aim is to make the scammers look like jerks. You will in-turn only appear to be a jerk. People will remember the emotion or air you create not the logic, and the questions won't resonate with them. Rather, ask with an unbiased truly inquisitive tone. If asked like this, you can ask the question more often and the scammers would have to address it. If it's apparent that they are skirting around issue, it will add to their discredit. Hopefully, people will start to ask this same questions of themselves, and hopefully reevaluate their thoughts and behaviour. 1. If/when you ask questions to your traveling partners, don't answer it. Let them think about it. They know the answer. If they give you an answer, build on that, letting them know they came to that conclusion. You want to use their worlds and their ideas as much as possible. 1. Curb the cursing when trying to presenting a point. Me, I really don't fuckin' care what people say. But when other people hear you use expletives to show passion, again, it can detract from your over all message. Often times, the person in control of their cool appears 'to win'. If you let sub-optimal emotions get the best of you, you then come off again as that angsty or insecure guy, rather than the thoughtful guy who's advice I should probably heed. Good eye and analyzing of these scams. And thanks for giving me the opportunity to look at again how persuading a group happens."}

Once she realized I lived in China, knew some chinese and realized the whole thing was bs she offered to tell the salespeople to leave me alone as long as I didn't try to discourage the other tourists from buying things. The last day I had a different guide and I decided to not speak any chinese the whole day to see what happened.

One involved a rather nice tea ceremony where they gave me the \"VIP treatment\" because they could see I was a \"man of powerful qi\". Well, I went through the whole thing which took about 45 minutes, drank their \"free\" tea and when they started going through the products and prices said to them in Chinese \"oh, no thanks, I can get this cheaper in the (chinese) city I live in.\" I wish I had my camera out...

Once the damage is done, though, there really is no benefit to convincing people they've been scammed, other than showing people you know better than them (hint: this rarely goes over well).

I will also include your suggestions on this list and update it when a new book comes out. Let’s start with the **core social engineering books.** They cover the principles of manipulation and how to elicit information. *Note: This list is updated in 15/07/2025* [**The Science of Human Hacking by Christopher Hadnagy**]( **–** You’ll learn how to profile people based on communication styles, build rapport, and gather sensitive information. [**Human Hacking by Chris Hadnagy**]( **–** It will teach you how to think like a social engineer and influence people in everyday situations. [**The Code of Trust by Robin Dreeke**]( **–** He worked as an FBI Counterintelligence agent for about 20 years, where his mission was to connect with foreign spies or agents and often convince them to betray their country. You'll learn how to build deep trust even with people who are suspicious or adversarial. However it's not about manipulation. It’s about becoming the kind of person others feel safe opening up to. [**Truth Detector by Jack Schafer**]( **–** It will help you build rapport with your target and elicit information from them. [**Ghost in the Wires by Kevin Mitnick**]( **–** It’s an autobiographical book of the most famous hacker in the US. He explains how he manipulated employees and bypassed the security measures using charm and persuasion. [**The Art of Attack by Maxie Reynolds**]( **–** It dives deep into the mindset and tactics you need to have to pull off successful social engineering attacks. [**No Tech Hacking by Johnny Long**]( **–** You’ll learn dumpster diving, tailgating, shoulder surfing, impersonation, and much more. He focuses solely on breaking into places without tech tools. [**Extreme Privacy (5th Edition) by Michael Bazzell**]( **–** You'll learn to find online information about you and erase it so you can protect your privacy. It's a guide to becoming invisible in a time when surveillance and digital profiling are the norm. [**The Art of Learning by Josh Waitzkin**]( **–** To become an expert in a field, you need to master multiple skills. Well, this book offers a comprehensive framework to master ANY skill quickly and deeply. It is written by Josh Waitzkin, who's a former chess prodigy and Tai Chi world champion. In my view, this book should become required reading in schools. # Technical Social Engineering This section covers how to plan and execute more sophisticated attacks by combining digital tools, OSINT, and psychological manipulation. [**OSINT (11th Edition) by Michael Bazzell**]( **–** He has spent over 20 years as a government computer crime investigator. During most of that time, he was assigned to *the FBI's Cyber Crimes Task Force*, where he focused on various online investigations and source intelligence collection. After leaving government work, he served as the technical advisor for the first season of “Mr. Robot”. In this edition (published in 2024), you will learn the latest tools and techniques to collect information about anyone. [**The Hacker Playbook 3 by Peter Kim**]( **–** He has over 12 years of experience in penetration testing/red teaming for major financial institutions, large utility companies, Fortune 500 entertainment companies, and government organizations. THP3 covers every step of a penetration test. It will help you take your offensive hacking skills to the next level. [**Advanced Penetration Testing by Wil Allsopp**]( Wil has over 20 years of experience in all aspects of penetration testing. He has been engaged in projects and delivered specialist training on four continents. This book takes hacking far beyond Kali Linux and Metasploit to provide a more complex attack simulation. It integrates social engineering, programming, and vulnerability exploits into a multidisciplinary approach for targeting and compromising high-security environments. # Strategic Thinking Skills This section is about developing the mindset of a strategist… someone who can see the big picture and uses resources efficiently. [**Red Team by Micah Zenko**]( **–** This book draws from military, intelligence, and corporate settings to teach how to think like an adversary. [**Team of Teams by Gen. Stanley McChrystal**]( **–** He explains how elite US military forces in Iraq had to abandon rigid hierarchies and adopt networked, self-directed teams. These teams were more loyal to each other, shared information freely, and could make **autonomous decisions** in situations when time was essential. This allowed them to outmaneuver a faster and more ruthless enemy. For social engineers, the book offers insight into how modern organizations can be restructured for speed and resilience, and how companies operating under rigid, hierarchical models often have serious and obvious structural flaws. [**Psychology of Intelligence Analysis by Richards Heuer**]( **–** This has been, for many years, a required reading within the CIA. It covers the most common cognitive biases and how to exploit them. [**The Gervais Principle by Venkatesh Rao**]( **–** He explains the archetypes of office workers and uses \"The Office\" TV show as a way to illustrate those lessons. If you work in an office, you must read this to better understand the people you're dealing with. And if you're a social engineer, it can help you understand and exploit those people. # The Psychology of Persuasion **Forbidden Keys to Persuasion by Blair Warren** **–** This is hands down the best book on persuasion. The only downside is that somehow he's not selling it online so you have to find it elsewhere. [**Never Split the Difference by Chris Voss**]( **–** A former head of the *FBI International Negotiation Team* shows how to gain the upper hand in any negotiation, without making unnecessary concessions. [**Just Listen by Mark Goulston**]( **–** He was a psychologist who taught you how to stay calm in stressful situations, diffuse tension, and influence even the most difficult people. [**Digital Body Language by Erica Dhawan**]( **–** Understanding people's body language and its meaning when they communicate through a screen. **Psychological Warfare** The books we've covered so far will teach you how to manipulate people and break into well-protected organizations. But this section goes much further. It explains how governments and corporations manipulate human behavior at scale. In other words, it is social engineering for the masses. [**The Lucifer Effect by Philip Zimbardo**]( **–** It’s a disturbing look at how power and authority can turn ordinary people into monsters. It is based on the Stanford Prison Experiment. [**This Is How They Tell Me the World Ends by Nicole Perlroth**]( **–** This investigative book shows how countries use hackers for espionage, psychological operations, infrastructure sabotage, and global influence. [**Active Measures by Thomas Rid**]( **–** It explains how nations have used (and still use) deception to gain more influence and power. He has researched a century of covert influence campaigns from Soviet disinformation to modern digital psychological warfare. [**How to Spot Deception, Manipulation, and Propaganda**]( I’m biased because I wrote it, but this is the most practical guide in understanding and outsmarting the gifted Machiavellians. These are individuals with strong persuasion skills AND are willing to do whatever it takes to achieve their goals. In some cases, they’ve the necessary resources to manipulate people on a massive scale. (Think of Edward Bernays, Steve Bannon, and Roger Ailes). So if you want to protect yourself from scammers, abusive people, and propagandists, then check it out.

Social engineering is a school of legitimate techniques used alongside physical techniques by pen-testers to compromise a business. Normally to detect and fix any security vulnerabilities. It's also used by criminals, most commonly in the form of phishing scams. The reason social engineering is widely regarded as a form of hacking is simple. Hacking is making something do what it wasn't designed to do, hacking a human (tricking them) is social engineering. Social engineering is a niche that's really only spoken about in pen-testing/security contexts. It's not really a synonym for social skills however social skills *can* make social engineering tactics easier. Welcome to the Social Engineering subreddit!"}

There are plenty of straightforward alternatives if they actually genuinely need USB devices: Use a locking device to lock the authorised devices physically in place so people can't plug in other devices. Or use adapters that makes the USB ports physically incompatible with off the shelf external devices. Or set aside quarantined machines. Basically, because of the lax security model of USB, allowing staff to plug a random USB devices they found on the street into a machine with access to the internal network is pretty close to equivalent to them letting some random stranger that approach them outside the office into the building and giving them unmonitored access to the staff members computer.

Obvious question, why? I don't know really. You only ever know what you experience and I guess I was curious. I lurk this sub a lot and I honestly thought \"where do people find these weirdos\". After this experiment, the answer turned out to be a very generic \"online\". So, let's crack on with what I learned. **Guys love their dicks and ~~want~~ need you to look at them** I knew going into it that I was going to get bombarded by various penises from around the globe but the [sheer]( [scale]( was [impressive]( Those are just the ones I wanted to screenshot, literally every word of this paragraph could be linked to a different guy. One guy was kind enough to even send me three. All of them different dicks. I think the reason behind the dick pic is that in their mind, if a girl was to send a picture of her vagina to a random guy, he'd love it, so why not return the favour? **You can get away with anything if you're hot** I do mean anything. [(1)]( Obviously those don't reflect my opinions, I just started seeing how far I could go. I spoke to him for ages and he clearly wasn't a racist, Islamophobe or anti-Semite, he just pretended to be to talk to me. Honestly, he wasn't the only one. I pretended to be incredibly stupid, a conspiracy nut and someone with genuine psychological problems. They didn't really take in anything I was saying, I was talking at them and they were just nodding in the hope that if you agree with enough of my idiotic ideas, you get rewarded with naked pictures. **I was finally popular and it was fun to start with** I posted my username on [Kikfriends]( stated that I was female, looking for men or women and looking for someone to talk to. I didn't have to wait long. Immediately, my phone was blowing up with more people eager to talk to me than I could respond to. I'd say that in my one day (well, about 12 hours) I got more than 300 messages. The stats on Kikfriends says that I have 848 views at time of writing. Now, I'm a middle of the road kind of guy. I'm not amazingly attractive, pretty introvert and have only ever handled a small group of friends. I wasn't popular in school, nor was I bottom row. But today has taught me what being popular means and, honestly, it rocked. I felt like everybody wanted to hang out with me, that saying they knew me was some sort of achievement. I had never had that before and got sucked in but then you realise why they're nice to you and it sorta breaks the magic. I went from \"look at me, come talk to me\" to wanting to be avoided. I knew that every person that messaged me had one purpose and it was soul destroying. I was no longer a person. It's hard to explain but given the content on this sub, I'm sure you're all familiar with it. **You learn to hate pet names VERY QUICKLY** I've never been one to call my girlfriend hun, babes or puddleduck or whatever. It just doesn't sit right on my tongue. It's like when teachers try to be cool, it's just so obviously forced. I never had a problem with pet names is what I'm saying, I just didn't use them. Now though, I fucking abhor them. I used a name in my profile so that I was easier to talk to. Monica is what I went with. The amount of times I was \"sexy\", \"beautiful\", \"babe\", \"hun\" or my personal worst \"bb\" (YOU'RE MISSING OUT TWO LETTERS, IT'S NOT MUCH QUICKER) is beyond count. It really started to annoy me more than it should've. What pet names like \"beautiful\" and \"sexy\" represent to me now are just words that show the guys intentions, that you're not a person, you're a body he wants to do sex on. A vessel for his seed. Literally that's all. That's by no means ground breaking but it's a recurring theme. **You get mean out of necessity** I'm not an angry person. I'm not a mean person. I can't hurt peoples feelings. Today was different. [(1)]( Now those may not seem very mean to you but I've never been that directly horrible to a person before this and it really made me feel bad. But believe it or not, it was the only way to get him to stop talking to me. Without background, I seem out of the blue mean but what you're missing is that he said it was my fault that guys were sending me dick pics (more on that in a second) and was being very chauvinistic. I told him I don't want to talk to him because we have differing opinions but he kept coming back asking me if I've ever been with a girl and if they're \"more tender\" than guys and asking my bra size and if I've done anal. I'd say \"please stop talking to me\", he'd stop for five minutes then chime in with \"whats the biggest dick you've been with?\". Where the picture start is him not talking to me for probably going on 30 minutes then out of the blue he starts telling me that his dad is annoying him or something. It was just getting too much. I'd hate to have to be mean for more than this experiment. **It's my fault that guys treat me the way they do (and it's what I want)** (I hear that Trigger Warnings are essential, so I do use the word rape here, if that upsets you, the TL;DR is I was blamed for the amount of guys not treating me as a human being because the picture I used had cleavage, feel free to skip) I started this to prove to myself that it's not as bad as it seems. I was wrong. I honestly wanted to talk to people and hoped that my being female was a small formality. I was not looking for dick pics and guys calling me a slut to screencap them and say \"ha, guys are dicks\". The picture I chose was what I would consider attractive, there was admittedly a bit of cleavage but not a lot and it was not the focus of the picture. It just happened to be there. So when I get shit like [this]( it fucking annoyed me. He meant attention I think. Over and over I'd get guys opening with \"I'm sorry\", I'd ask \"why?\", then be told that guys will be sending me pictures because my tits are out. Fuck off. Also, does this mean that if cleavage is present guys are unable to treat women as human being? 'Cause that's what I learned today. It was my fault. Heck, the girl in the picture I used has probably been raped five ways to Friday on the day that she wore that top. **You meet guys to talk to but it's hard to escape the fact that they want to see you naked** I met a few guys that I got talking to, had some pretty fun conversations it was great. Then this would happen. [(1)]( It sucked. It sucked hard. I don't actually have any words for it. I discovered the other side of the \"friend zone\". I was the girl with the guy friend who wanted to date her and *boo hoo, the guy really wants to date the girl but she's just interested in being friends and it's such a shame for the guy*. Fuck the guy, fuck the guy in his asshole. I wasn't flirty. I was me, just under the guise of being female. I talked about the football team I supported (come on you Barca), the games I liked, the shows I watched. I wasn't winking going \"will you be the Jamie to my Cercei, giggle\" but the topic of sex always came up and it was always unavoidable. I'd dismiss it like I hadn't heard him and continue as normal, as would he. Then it'd come back again and again. Once you firmly establish that you won't be talking about sex or sending them naked pictures, they get bored and most of the time [will let you know.]( **Guys have a fantasy and you don't have a choice whether to play along or not** I was pretending to be a new mother in search of a \"baby daddy\". I was poorly educated, racist and a cheat. The first time I tried that act, the guy bit. He said he'd look after me, send me money, the whole shebang. Then he started calling me a slut, a whore, sending me picture of his dick telling me that \"You love that you filthy slut\". To this point, nothing I said could've led him to think humiliation was a turn on for me. At all. Nothing. I dropped the act and asked what the fuck he was doing. His reply was \"I thought you wanted it\". It was obvious that this was his fetish and I had to play along. He wasn't even the only one. I had an encounter with a guy that wanted me to pretend he was tiny and I was to squish him? I don't know what he wanted. I'm not ridiculing that fetish, if that's what gets you off, great but I don't know anything about it. Anyway, the point was that these were forced upon me and they didn't care about it from my perspective. It goes along with the recurring theme that I'm not human to them. I'm a picture on their phone that could be a really well designed game. Say things in the correct order and you win! **Guys pretend to be girls(HOW COULD THEY)** What I mean is that countless times a woman would message me and eventually try to get picture of me. \"Could've been a lesbian\" I hear you say? Wrong. It was so very obvious that the pictures they were sending were something they ripped from 4chan or something. Anytime they'd tell me they were taking a picture for me, it'd come from their gallery. (I wasn't asking for pictures, they were insisting that if they send me something, I should send them something) Oceans Eleven-esque deception it was not. I think they genuinely believe women are all naked around each other for any amount of time. That locker rooms are like that one scene in Not Another Teen Movie, that it's a given that a girl has had a lesbian experience. It's mind numbing that they think women are so far detached from them that don't do things they do. **I gave a guy exactly what he wanted and it made me feel bad** Now, the picture of the girl I was using also came with a naked picture of her. She's a fairly obscure [Page 3 Model]( so don't feel bad that her naked picture is now out there. It was already out there. So yeah. A guy messages me with a picture of his dick and I decide to see what the end result of this is. I sent a couple other pictures (with clothing) and he obliged with more nudity, so I then dropped the naked pic on him. After what I think was him ejaculating (I'm straight but dedicated to this) we talked. We talked about where he was from, his plans for the future etc etc. Really deep shit that I think counts as pillow talk? After a long time, he started telling me that he loved me. I thought the same thing you're thinking right now, \"guys will say anything to get what they want\". So I said that to him. He then started to tell me that he's never had a girlfriend, he's really lonely and I was the first person to show interest in him and that he might not know what love feels like, but that he was feeling something. I don't know why it got to me but it crushed me. Every time I seen a dick pic I could only see this guy behind it, someone who doesn't know how to connect with women, who is lonely and someone who is otherwise a good person. I'm not sticking up for the guys who throw dicks into ~~your~~our face. I'm really not. They're wrong and need to be told so. But they're not out the be horrible, they honestly think that it's what you want, deluded as they may be. They think it'll make you like them. And that depresses me. These people won't have much luck with potential relationships and they won't know enough to know that it's their fault. They'll blame women and well, that's how /r/TheRedPill/ happened. [I'll end on a happy note. This is a serious profile picture that a guy had (censor is mine) and it makes me giggle.]( I need to go look at some puppies or something now. **I'm being flooded right now and may take some time to reply but I'll try to reply to as many people as I can**"}

It's not too difficult actually, because there's a difference between knowing someone's personality and knowing their stories. Funny stories are perfect for this because the focus isn't on you, it's on the joke. So for instance, you can go and tell people dozens of different jokes and funny situations and then they can feel they've listened to you for ages and therefore must know your personality. But while they did listen to stories about you, those stories would have been nearly identical if you substituted anyone else in your place, so they actually haven't learnt anything of substance about *you*and your personality. You can also give them loads of facts and statistics about you (and keep it from being boring by packaging it nicely in a joke/funny story).

He talked about his Dad and it sounded like he was giving you personal insights but if you really listen, it was just information. For example, he talks about what his dad thinks his on stage experiences are, but he doesn't really confirm or deny them. He doesn't talk about his thoughts or viewpoints or emotions really, like in a relatable way. The talk SOUNDS personal but it isn't at all.

An Extensive Guide to Russian Social Engineering Techniques and How To Counter Them.", "content": "There was a vital invention that has saved tens of millions of human lives throughout history — soap and hygiene. The simple ritual of washing hands stopped the spreading of deadly diseases and allowed humankind to make a gigantic leap. To survive now, we need to introduce to our everyday life another crucial ritual — “washing our thoughts”, that helps us to see and dispose of thoughts propaganda tries to implement. We could see another age of dictatorships and wars if we don’t. How to do it? There is a trick in countering propaganda: if you can name and understand how a technique is intended to influence your mind, it will not work on you. And we live in the “blissed” times when almost a whole country provides the world with tons of selected propaganda. Let’s examine Russian propaganda’s methods and how to avoid getting on its hook. #### 1) “Rotten Fish” If you repeat something disgusting about someone, whether true or not, it “sticks” to that person/country. A good example is a statement regarding nazi/nationalistic groups in Ukraine. Russia doesn’t aim to prove this; it only wants that there was a discussion, defenders and attackers for this thesis. As a result, if the person stands near a rotten fish for too long, the smell sticks to them, and the person becomes unconsciously associated with the idea. I am amazed at how it works because it is complete bullshit for me, and I would never think somebody would believe it. I have lived in different parts of Ukraine: Eastern, Western, and Central, but I have never seen at least half of a nazi in person. However, I met people from Germany, Serbia, and other countries that believed it. &#x200B; #### 2) “60/40” 60% of truth and 40% of lies. Create a media that deliver truthful information, but after establishing trust and the audience, starts to incept propagandistic messages. In WWII, Goebbels created an “anti-nazi” radio station that successfully existed and served nazis until the war’s end. Only after the audience found out it was nazi propaganda. Channel “Russia Today” could be an excellent example of leveraging such a principle. #### 3) “Creation of a dragon” A common enemy unites a group and can be blamed for any calamities the group suffers. Finding an absolute enemy is sewn into our unconsciousness with hundreds of fairytales about knights, dragons, Saurons, etc. Russia leverages it by making USA and NATO the dragon. In Ukraine, we mock it like: “Oh, that was Biden and Zelensky who corrupted the Russian government, littered on the streets, and turned so many people into alcoholics”. Why does this technique work? Usually, it works on people that don’t take responsibility for their lives and are used to blaming others. It’s always easier to accuse someone than work hard on improving one’s life. Another factor — is a lack of critical thinking. If people are told by TV that Russia’s adversaries are because of the USA/masons/Jews, bothering with analysis of the actual cause-and-effect relationships of this thesis could result in catastrophic consequences — the need to make independent actions and choices, which is extremely scary! So, it’s better to have a dragon. #### 4) “Creation of a saviour” If you have a dragon, you need a prince or “the saviour” who will “protec, attac and provide snacks”. By creating a strong image (only image), Putin leverages this method to get the loyalty of not only Russians but also people abroad. The mechanism of this technique is the same: if a person doesn’t want to work hard and transform their life, they or will start looking for the saviour who could do it for them. The whole USSR ideological machine had successfully leveraged this method for 90 years, and you could find a lot of other entities that use it. The thing is that “salvation” always stays on the mythological level — the promise of the Lost Paradise is never fulfilled. #### 5) “A very big lie” Confidently stating something so unlogical and blatant that a person willy-nilly starts to believe it — people refuse to believe that anyone can lie so shamelessly. A good example is Russia’s statement that USA and Ukraine are developing biologically modified birds for spreading diseases in Russia. The crucified child in Donbas goes to that pool also. #### 6) “Power Signalling” Similar to the big lie, but perceives another aim and audience. Stating some complete rubbish always sends a signal like “I can do whatever I want, and you can change nothing”. The goal of such informational overload with fiction stories about biolabs, children’s crucifixions and nazis are to subconsciously persuade intelligent people in Russia that they can’t change anything. As someone said: “The true goal of propaganda is not to persuade you but to make you do nothing”. The power signalling also works for an external audience: “see how much control I have over my population! I can feed them lies that are obvious for the whole world to see!” ### 7) Their Majesty “Whataboutism” My favourite one. It aims to redirect the attention from accusing to self-justification. For example, if somebody mentions Bucha or Mariupol massacres, a Russian can counter it with smth like: “And what has the USA done to Iraq?”. So, two things happen. Somebody others sin is used to justify their own, which it doesn’t. And the attention is driven from the central thesis to another country and other times. “Moral Equivalence” is one of the whatoubatism variations. Popular with Nazi apologists and holocaust deniers. The argument is that X is bad, BUT everyone does it. For example, soldiers in every army have killed POWs and civilians and committed rape, so why pick on the poor Russians? #### 8) Brandolini’s law (Bullshit symmetry principle) It is an internet adage that emphasises the effort of debunking misinformation compared to the relative ease of creating it in the first place. It states, “The amount of energy needed to refute bullshit is an order of magnitude bigger than that needed to produce it.” Russians leverage it by creating many crazy narratives: biolabs, nazi, Ukrainians bombing Donbas, Poland wanting to conquer the west of Ukraine, Ukraine wanting to attack Russia… You see, you could get a bit tired just by reading this sentence. Thanks a redditer u/Ok-Yogurtcloset-6740 for providing info on this technique. Another example by u/LuukR on how Russians tried to shift responsibility for the MH17 catastrophe. First, they claimed that Ukrainian jets shut down MH17 even though those jets couldn’t reach that altitude (they edited Wikipedia to support their claim). Then Ukrainian SAMs supposedly shut down MH17 even though it was clearly proven that it was a specific BUK rocket that only Russia possessed. And finally, the CIA put a bomb inside the plane because… it is always the CIA. Often Brandolini’s law is paired with the Gish Gallup, whose goal is to overwhelm an opponent with a stream of true or false arguments to put out so many your opponent can’t refute everything. Thanks, u/FlatBlueSky for explaining that. #### 9) “The firehose of falsehood” It is similar to Brandolini’s law. Basically throwing bullshit at the wall in the hope that some of it will stick, with no regard for verifiability, realism, or % of the truth, just massed claims pulled out of a vatnik’s ass. If you try to combat it, by the time you debunk one lie, 20 more will take its place, so the only feasible option is to tune it out entirely, at which point vatniks complain that they wanted an honest discussion, but you don’t. The goal isn’t to build any self-consistent false narrative because it’s hard to get enough consistency. Instead, the goal is to throw out such a massive number of narratives that the truth gets buried. Then everyone latches onto the narrative that has the most emotional appeal to them personally. Thanks for that u/KlaatuBaradaN-word. Scientific research that reinforces this technique is that lies spread faster than truth: [ #### 10) “Divide and Conquer” Old as the world, seeding distrust and dislike between allies by, e.g. posing as one while overzealously criticising another. Thanks, u/einalex for highlighting this one. I.e., Russia accused Poland of preparing to invade the west of Ukraine. Creating many videos on Europe that “is freezing without Russia” to undermine Europe’s support of democracy. #### 11) “Strong and weak enemy” Another widespread one, fascists used this a lot: The enemy is both weak and strong simultaneously. So, it is OK to insult and call them derogatory names; they are nothing compared to their own country/race. But at the same time, these ‘weak’ others also threaten our culture/country/safety. Using this, Russia can display Ukraine as a state that shouldn’t be there/is just little Russia AND as a den of lethal neo-nazi wanting to eat Russian babies. They can adjust the frame/argument according to what is needed at that particular moment. Thanks, u/LLLLLdLLL, for providing thoughts on that. #### 12) Radicalisation Much propaganda is built on a kernel of truth. That makes people more likely to believe the rest of the message alongside the truth. “X is not perfect — we can prove this — therefore, X is the worst possible thing and is the enemy.” You see this in purposeful propaganda efforts and even in ordinary people posting on social media. “This group didn’t do exactly what I think they should, so let’s hate everything about them!!! We must oppose them!” Credits to u/ChairsAndFlaff for providing information on that. Example: Russia has conducted an excellent campaign using this technique in Germany. They published many articles on Ukrainian “nationalism” and “antisemitism” in influential German media during 2014–15. The topic was about a political party, “Svoboda”, some members of which made few antisemitic statements, and Russia started to trumpet “nazis in Ukraine”. The truth is those were very few members of that party, which itself got only around 5% of the seats in our parliament. The party members didn’t have a lot of support and were mostly perceived as chatterboxes and populists. As a result, they didn’t get any seats during our next elections. #### 13) “Truth Relativism” It is impossible to prove anything with absolute certainty, so nothing can be proved. For instance, Oryx must be wrong because the figures cannot be verified completely. This type of argument is popular with Covid deniers, flat earthers and those who think the moon landing was faked. There are degrees of wrongness, so we can discuss degrees of truth. Russia leverages it in narratives like “you can’t stay with confidence that wasn’t Ukrainians in Bucha / it wasn’t staged” and so on. Even some pretty direct evidence, like satellite images, still can be “relevant” from the point of view of the Russian propagandists. #### 14) “Victimhood” This changes the narrative to make the people of Russia seem to be the real victims. “It’s Russian people suffering the most because they “have to” follow their dictator”. Though, it’s not Putin who kills civilians, shells energy infrastructure and posts requests to destroy Ukrainians on local Russian social media. For the previous two, and “moral equivalence, I thank u/One_Cream_6888 **15) “Sealioning”** A subtle form of trolling involving “bad-faith” questions. You disingenuously frame your conversation as a sincere request to be enlightened, placing the burden of educating you entirely on the other party. If your bait is successful, the other party may engage, painstakingly laying out their logic and evidence in the false hope of helping someone learn. In fact, you are attempting to harass or waste the other party’s time and have no intention of truly entertaining their point of view. Instead, you react to each piece of information by misinterpreting it or requesting further clarification ad nauseum. Russian trolls use this technique as a hook for engaging and starting to promote their narratives. Credits to u/briefnuts for this technique. \\*\\*\\* Propaganda is fuel for dictatorship regimes. Understanding and educating others about it undermines dictatorships and prevents their spread. Analysing and processing all the data we consume nowadays is as important as washing our hands. Stopping “ideological bacteria” from spreading, we give the whole of humanity to survive the dictatorship pandemic and take a step toward a peaceful future and coexistence. That’s why education and critical thinking will play a critical role in our survival. Thank you for reading!

I'll mimic an actual event I saw in the afternoon yesterday, but add this twist to the conversation. So to setup the scene, it's a fast food restaurant in the early afternoon on a hot day. We have a very enthusiastic dude we'll call Derick and an unenthusiastic fast food supervisor we'll call Annie. Annie is busy trying to keep up with drive-through and supervising the floor staff. Derick can tell she's busy, multitasking, and sets himself a goal. Derrick bypasses the order line, approaches where food is given to customers (and people usually go with questions/complaints) and he points up at a display for a new seasonal product. It's an outrageous product that screams MURICA. The Cheetos encrusted Mac'n'Cheese Bite. > Derick: What *is* that? Annie: It's a Cheetos Mac'n'Cheese Bite. Derick: *Really?* That's crazy. No *way*. Who would think of something like that? Annie: Corporate. Derick: No way! That's nuts. Is it *good*? Now, at this point, Derick is trying to manipulate Annie into offering him a free sample. You see, Derick doesn't have any money on him, came in with a friend who is in line buying a bunch of something super cheap, and both guys look like they're probably recently released ex-cons. They seem nice enough, though. Derick's friend is ultra-chill and mostly is trying not to draw attention to himself. Derick on the other hand is trying to leverage enthusiasm, questioning, etc, to \"offer an opportunity\" to the supervisor to push a new product. In the real world, Annie ignored this. The manipulation failed. Derick rubs his head, affects that he's still blown away by the seasonal offering, and follows his friend out. No doubt upset on some level that his attempt to manipulate failed. The enthusiasm trick (show enthusiasm, be friendly, present no threat, etc) often works for people. Derick was just a *tad* over-dramatic about it and did it in a place that cares more about sales than advertising. The same trick at a local business will often net you a sample. So let's have Annie flip it by clarifying goals. > Annie: You trying for a sample? [Friendly grin.] Derick: Daw, you got me. [Hangs head dramatically.] This establishes that Annie knows what Derick is up to, and Derick plays it off. Now they're on totally even footing. Derick will see that Annie is paying attention and is on the level, but she hasn't denied him. Now Annie has two options, deny him and he knows he was caught, or give into the manipulation so as not to sour Derick's mood. > Annie: Hey Sarah? [To the register.] Comp this guy some bites, I'll swipe it in. Sarah: Got it. Derick: Oh, sweet! Thanks! Now you might ask, why would Annie choose this path? Derick could or could not be a customer in the future and it's clear he likes to talk to people. He is enthusiastic. He will remember when someone does him a solid, and because he knows he didn't get something for free due to manipulation but *because he was forced to realize someone chose to give it to him*, he will be more likely to return the favor. No doubt he'll spend the next two days talking about the Cheetos Mac'n'Cheese bite to anyone who will listen. He'll also mention that the supervisor over at the fast food restaurant is sharp and will catch you. This reduces the rate of similar incidents, depending on the size of the community around it. It may also net you more sales. The way this clarification works changes based on the nature of the manipulator, the manipulation, the situation, etc."}

WARNING: Wall of text, but worth the read!", "content": "When I was eighteen years old I got my very first job at a video retail store called I will not name. It was probably my favorite job I've ever had. In 2001, I stole my very first DVD which was \"From Hell\" starring Johnny Depp (side note: TERRIBLE MOVIE). I stole it by taking it into the employee bathroom, slicing it open with a razor, and removing the security tag (DVDs have these black/white strips inside that will trigger an alarm if they are not deactivated). I would then stuff the DVD in my pants and request to go buy a drink (in which I would really go to my car, first). Why did I do this? I wanted to see the movie, it looked interesting in the previews and I didn't have the money to purchase it (at the time, my parents forced me to deposit my paychecks into a savings account… all of it, I was allowed no money for myself). I didn't experience any kind of thrill from stealing, I just really wanted to see the movie so I took it. No thought of \"stealing is wrong\" entered my head. I know it's wrong in the sense of the law, but for some reason, I did not care. This kind of stealing evolved the next couple of years when I got a few of my friends involved. Usually it would go like this: * Wait until Monday when it was just me and the General Manager. 3:30pm, the General Manager would go on a conference call in the back room for a mandatory one hour meeting. * During this time, I would call in my friends and they would collect all of the DVDs they wanted, bring them to the counter where I was working, and I would promptly begin to deactivate them. In exchange for this, they would collect DVDs I wanted. * Once completed I would do a \"fake transaction\" in case there were other customers in the store and pretend to take a credit card. * After the fake transaction my friends would leave the store and I would retrieve my \"bag\" at a later time. This operation went on for at least two years and I amassed a collection of over 1000 DVDs as a result. None of the customers in the store question these blue collar people buying what looked to be hundreds of dollars worth of DVDs every Monday. At no point in time did I ever feel remorse of any kind for ripping off this company by the THOUSANDS. In fact, it was a good feeling for me that I had amassed such an impressive collection of films. You're probably wondering if my parents noticed this collection. To be quite honest with you, I am not sure. I kept my collection really well hidden at first, but eventually I stopped caring. My parents never said a word to me about it. At the store I worked in, one had the ability to reserve a DVD if it was set to be released in the future. One customer in who I will call Cornelius, was some rich guy who used to come in and order them by the dozens and pay for them in full. I was his favorite employee since we had similar tastes in films and I liked to hear about his exploits in his business (he was a high ranking \"problem solver\" for some world-wide corporation). So he used to always reserve films when I was at the register (this also helped keep me employed there since employees had a quota that needed to be filled). One day, when he was picking up his reserves I happened to notice that I accidentally overcharged him a reserve (something like $22.99 instead of $19.99). You take reserve tickets in the register the same way as a coupon, and usually if a customer used a coupon the went over the price of the DVD it would just omit the change (for obvious reasons). At first, I thought it was going to omit the change, but this was different. Because Mr. Harms had pre-paid (pre-paid being the key word) he was entitled to change so new options appeared \"Cash or credit\", so when I hit cash, the register opened and I was able to give him money back. After this instance, the wheels began to turn in my head. I learned that it was potentially possible to remove cash from the register without a shortage appearing on the end of the night report. But first, I needed to learn what exactly the manager does at the end of the night. So for a few weeks (I usually always closed) I watched intently what kind of reports are printed out and what the manager actually accounts for. What I noticed was rather alarming, but beneficial to my cause. My General Manager only checked the cash totals, he didn't even count up the credit card totals to make sure those were correct. He also had a list of reservation certificates redeemed (the ones that I will soon use to take money out of the register) that he just signed off on that he checked and they were ok. After that, he would rubber band all of the reports together, write the date on them, and throw them carelessly into a plastic bin. Once the bin was full, they were discarded in the trash. So once every 90 days they were discarded, helping my cause even further. I kept this entirely to myself and told absolutely no one. In fact, as I type this, this is the first time I have ever disclosed this information. So this started out with me writing up a fake reservation tickets, usually for the amount of 49.99 and then using that to redeem an equally fake 29.99 DVD so I'd get an easy $20. It should be noted that there was no real way to inventory reservations since you could redeem these tickets at ANY OF THE STORES IN THE USA. Just like my DVD stealing scam I still had going, this evolved from me doing the $20 scam I just described to a whopping $120 scam every shift I worked. I worked there five days a week since I sold the most reservations. Sometimes I would do two $120 scams in a row. The $120 scam was me redeeming a $120 reserve on a $1.00 bottle of pop we had in the store. At the end of the night, I would glance at the closing paperwork and see these outrageous dollar amounts in the reserves. But true to form, the managers never checked and signed off on it blindly. This was mostly due to the fact because the closing managers lived considerably far from the store and wanted to leave as quickly as possible. I had this scam going strong for the next year and a half. I was literally making $600-$700 a week from the cash scam in the register. That's the equivalent of making almost $34,000 a year in addition to the measly $6.50 an hour I was receiving. You're probably wondering how no one saw me do this in the store, someone HAD to have seen me pocket all of this money!! I only really did this when the store of devoid of customers (which was frequent back in 2003/2004) and honestly, my General Manager was not an intelligent man. He was a very nice guy, just lacked any kind of common sense. Me, on the other hand, I am very observant and calculating. You're also probably assuming the corporate office had copies themselves of these reports at the end of the night with OUTRAGEOUS totals in the reservation redeems. Another thing on my side was the fact the company who owned the retail stores I worked at changed hands three times in this year and a half period. Even when the company settled in under the new owners I still went undetected. It was a stupid mistake on my part that led to my downfall. Even before this event I will explain a safety plan I devised. I want you to know that I am a neurotic over-thinker. I over-think everything, it's a serious problem I have but it is beneficial in certain things. Such as my work scams. There were times I wanted to stop the cash scam because I knew I would have been found out inevitably (just not very quickly) but the money was too good and I was an underachiever in my youth. So I started to develop a contingency plan should the inevitable day come where I am caught. I actually was interview by the Loss Prevention Detective for the company about a year prior to my scam being found out over something unrelated. So I saw how the man conducted himself in the interrogation, however I knew he was not looking for me. I researched how interrogators work and their various tactics to get criminals to \"crack.\" One of the most commonly used techniques is the \"Loaded Question Tactic.\" I will attempt to explain: A loaded question is a question which contains an unjustified assumption (e.g. , a presumption of guilt). Loaded questions are logical fallacies in themselves and typically used as rhetorical tools: the question attempts to limit direct replies to be those that serve the questioner's agenda. Example: The question \"Have you stopped beating your wife?\" presupposes that you have beaten your wife prior to its asking, as well as that you have a wife. If you are unmarried, or have never beaten your wife, then the question is loaded. Since this example is a yes/no question, there are only the following two direct answers: 1. \"Yes, I have stopped beating my wife\", which entails \"I was beating my wife.\" 2. \"No, I haven't stopped beating my wife\", which entails \"I am still beating my wife.\" The proper way to answer that loaded question would be to say \"I have never beaten my wife.\" But most people are stupid and would fall for it which would lead the interrogator into more questions until you inevitably crack. I was determined to not let this happen to me. Another thing, we did not have personal codes when ringing up something in the register, it was just open to anyone to use so you couldn't personally track who rang what. I knew it would be easy to connect the dots once I was found out but it would still be circumstantial without a confession. So without further adieu, let me explain how this came to an end for me. October 19, 2004, I made a grave mistake when I was at work. I needed some extra cash so I could go on a trip to Minnesota with a few friends. It was unusually busy (there were three big releases that week if I remember correctly), and I was finding it difficult to conduct my cash scam. Mainly because there were A LOT of customers around and it was just me and the General Manager. I didn't explain this before, but the cash scam takes one minute (minimum) to complete. I had to fill out a reserve ticket and then conduct the register operation… and our registers were OLD, like late 1980s DOS based computers OLD OLD OLD so that also meant SLOW SLOW SLOW. Sometimes, what I would do is conduct the scam, but retrieve the cash later (if it was busy). However, this particular day was so outrageously busy I conducted the scam but could not remember if I removed the cash from the drawer since I already had a large amount of case in my pocket. In retrospect, I should have taken it anyway because a $120 overage is loads more suspect than a shortage (think about it) but I opted to leave it. At the end of the night, sure enough, the drawer was $120 over and my General Manager was freaking the fuck out. But to my surprise he didn't troubleshoot by checking the report… he still signed off on EVERYTHING and figured he'd just get \"yelled at and it would blow over.\" So I was naturally relieved by his ignorance. I had the next day off, but I worked the day after that with my General Manager again. I asked him if he got into a lot of trouble and he simply said \"No.\" But it wasn't a suspicious \"no.\" So I carried on as always (I still needed the extra cash for my Minnesota trip). So I conducted my cash scam without a hitch and I figured everything would be ok. This would not prove to be the case. At the end of the night, I noticed my General Manager was VERY CAREFULLY looking at the register tape (the records of every single transaction for the day) and he abruptly stopped at one and highlighted it. Needless to say, this freaked me the fuck out but I opted to stay calm and continue my work. [Continued here]("}

Also, I requested the next few days off (about a month beforehand) I didn't tell them where I was going or what I was doing. If I remember correctly, I phrased it as I had to work on a school project (I'm not that dumb) but I was really going to Minnesota on a fishing trip. After three days passed, I came back to work and ohhhhhh man were things instantly different. This other part-time employee looked SCARED TO DEATH at the register so I asked her what was wrong. She told me a loss prevention detective was in the store and he wanted to interview every employee. I played it off like everything was ok, but I knew… I knew this was the day I was mentally preparing for… the inevitable interrogation. So I clocked in and went about my work routine when suddenly the General Manager comes out of the office and pulls me aside and tells me I need to talk to the LP Detective. I ask what it's about, and he just says \"he wants to talk to everyone.\" But I knew, I was the main event for this LP Detective. I'm basically SHOVED into the backroom and this Cliff Huxtable sweater wearing guy smiles at me, introduces himself, and politely asks me to sit down. His opening statement went something like: LP Detective: Hell there tweakofnature, I'm (I forgot his name), I work for the Loss Prevention Department of (whatever the corporations name was that owned the store I worked in). I'm here today conducting an investigation and I just need some basic information from you. He asked me my full name, date of birth, and how long I worked for the store. I answered him truthfully. He then asked me my personal definition of theft. To which I answered \"Taking something that doesn't belong to you.\" Meanwhile, as I am looking around the room, there are numerous old reports sprawled about with my cash scam transactions highlighted. Also several old employee schedules attempting to link me. I knew he was trying to fuck with me at this point, he knew it was me, he just needed me to say so otherwise he didn't have a case (gotta love that word \"circumstantial\")… so I decided to play right back. Normally, the interrogator will ask personal questions such as \"what you aspire to be?\" Normally the perp would answer honestly and then the questioning would take a more negative turn in an attempt to break the suspect for example: He did ask me: \"So what did you aspire to be when you were young?\" (career wise) If I had answered honestly with \" I wanted to be a filmmaker\" he most likely (speculative on my part) would have taken the questioning to either \"Looks like you just didn't cut it, right?\" or \"You probably need a lot of money to finance a film.\" Instead, I chose a different route, one to aggravate this man. I simply answered his questions WITH QUESTIONS. It went like this for a while: **LP Detective** : What did you aspire to be? **tweakofnature** : How long have you worked for (store name)? **LP Detective** : Have you ever stolen anything before? **tweakofnature** : Have you ever given anything away before? **LP Detective** : Do you ever get angry? **tweakofnature** : Have you ever been happy? He starts to get real irritated with me and accuses me of not being cooperative, to which I apologize for making him mad (which pisses him off more). Now here's where the Loaded questions come. He literally phrased it like this: **LP Detective**: \"tweakofnature, I'm going to ask you a loaded question, do you know what that is?\" (I lie and say I don't) **LP Detective**: \"It's just like a normal question, but it's one that I already know the answer to!\" **tweakofnature**: Ok…? **LP Detective**: \"Have you committed any form of theft this week?\" Here are the facts up to this point: * All of the evidence he had against me was entirely empirical and circumstantial; nothing concrete. * No one witnessed me doing these things I was being accused of. * He could connect the dots and see that the same dollar amount was taken on only days that I worked leading to a conclusion that it was most likely me, but alas; no concrete evidence… just conjecture. * I was always quiet and kept to myself at work, I never told anyone (not even my best friend) what I was doing. Most of the time when people steal money, they gloat about shit they bought with it. I knew that was not a smart move so I said nothing. * The General Manager and the Assistant Manager were in financial turmoil at the time, and I knew I could pawn the investigation onto them. I told the LP Detective… YES! That I had committed theft that week. He looked surprised by my admission of guilt. He then asked \"Could you describe what you did.\" I told him \"I stole three DVDs\", and went on to tell him that \"I knew that secret shopper spotted me and I've felt guilty ever since^1.\" His demeanor changed to what I can only describe as horrific confusion. He tripped over his words and said \"Oh… okay, okay!\" He asked me if that was my first time and I said yes because they cut our hours (which was true) and I had to cut corners in my budget. It was obvious he did not want to pursue this petty theft and wanted to bring the conversation back around to the cash scam. So he asked \"Thank you for your honesty, tweakofnature, now have you done any other types of theft?\" I asked him what he meant, and he said \"Did you ever maybe take any money out of the drawer?\" (notice: I mind-fucked him in such a way he forgot about the loaded questions). I told him never and that it was impossible, WOULDN'T THE DRAWER BE SHORT??? Then this stupid asshole decided to explain my own cash scam to me and I just pretended like I didn't understand it. He tried placating and ego I didn't have by saying \"If you think about it, this scam is rather ingenious!\" I just kept telling him I didn't understand how it could work. So he explained it probably three times and that's when I brought up \"Wouldn't this have shown up on a report?\" His face went to hard scowl and he just said \"maybe someone wasn't doing their job correctly.\" So now he tries scaring me by describing these hidden cameras they sometimes put into stores that are the size of a pin head. Before he even finished I flat out asked him \"Do you have me on video doing this?\" and he responds \"Are you sure you want me to answer that?\" DUMBEST THING YOU COULD HAVE SAID SHIT-FOR-BRAINS, you might as well have said no. So I answered sarcastically with \"Yes, I want to see something impossible.\" He gives me another scowl… this mother fucker is losing the battle, and he knows it. He ends up calling the police to report my theft and exits the back room telling me not to leave. He ends up coming in and out of the backroom intermittently trying to get me to confess to the money scam, but I remain tight lipped. Eventually the Police show up and ask where the merchandise is that I allegedly stole. They thought it was this big box of DVDs on the ground (we had a new shipment that needed to be put out on the floor). When the LP Detective told them that it wasn't the Cops stood there confused. This LP Detective didn't even have me write anything down or sign anything, however I did personally confess to him, but he couldn't prove it. After arguing with the cops, they pretty much tell him that they can't arrest me without some form of evidence. He tells them that I confessed, but ardently deny confessing anything and accuse him of trying to wrap up an open LP case. Eventually the cops tell him that they aren't arresting me and criticize how he does his job. Completely embittered and defeated, the LP Detective takes one look at me and tells me to leave the store and never come back. To which my reply was only: \"But why? I didn't do anything wrong!\" His face turned bright red, I got up from my seat and exited the store and I never returned. I heard several months later he was terminated (not because of me) because he royally fucked up another interrogation at a different store. I apologize if there are any grammar/spelling errors. Once I started typing, I simply could not stop. Thank you for reading. ^1 - I did that solely to fuck with him. He wasn't recording anything I was saying but merely writing it down. And if he wanted me to sign anything I would have refused and requested a lawyer. **TL;DR** : I stole over $30,000 from a retail job I had in 2003/2004 and after I was caught I outsmarted everyone and got away scott-free"}

Then the pain of my having bad social skills got bad enough. The isolation started to feel less like a choice and more like a prison. That's when I re-opened the book and started applying the principles for real this time. I went from being ignored to people asking advice for me now. Here’s the raw, unfiltered breakdown of the techniques I stole from Carnegie that actually changed everything: * I started using names a lot. It felt unnatural, almost manipulative at first. Instead of a generic \"thanks,\" it became \"Thanks, Sarah.\" Instead of \"good point,\" it was \"That's a sharp insight, Mike.\" I expected people to find it weird. Instead, they lit up. Their entire demeanor changed. You can see a flicker of recognition in their eyes, a small spark that says, \"You see me.\" * forced myself to become interested. I used to fake interest in other people's lives. It was exhausting and transparent. But instead of letting that past I decided to find somethin we can connect to. This was especially great when I realized my other co-worker also liked to draw. We became friends instantly when I knew he can also paint. * I forced myself to be humble. My old self was desperate to prove my intelligence. I’d correct people, one-up their stories, and offer unsolicited \"better\" ways of doing things. It was pure insecurity. I switched tactics. Now, when someone explains something, I ask, \"How did you even think of that?\" or \"What was your process for figuring that out?\" People hate being corrected. * stopped pointing out mistakes. A coworker screws up in a meeting. The old me might have pointed it out to look sharp but now \"I think those numbers might be from last quarter, we should double-check,\" or \"I might be misremembering, but I thought we agreed on X.\" It gives them an out. They get to fix the mistake without being publicly humiliated. They never forget who had their back in a moment of weakness. It helps a lot. * Instead of thinking what to say, I listened. I used to treat conversations like a debate. While the other person was talking, I'd think of what to say next. It was exhausting because I was performing a constant mental juggling act. I forced myself to stop. To just shut up and absorb what the other person was *actually saying*. To ask questions about *their* points. Suddenly, conversations weren't work anymore. When you stop trying to steer, you can actually enjoy the ride. * I celebrated people's wins. When a coworker did something well, I’d mention it to others, especially to people in charge. \"Did you see how Sarah handled that client? It was brilliant.\" It costs you nothing. Zero effort. But the person you celebrated will see you as an ally for life. People never forgive those who gossip about them but never forget those who praise them behind their backs. I hope this was helpful. This is what I use a lot even now. If you have questions feel free to ask. If you liked this post perhaps I can tempt you with my [weekly newsletter]( I write actionable tips like this and you'll also get \"Delete Procrastination Cheat Sheet\" as thanks Thanks for reading"}

So even if the CIA popularized it, they picked a pretty neutral term. But this article doesn't really prove what it sets out to. The whole argument is just *post hoc ergo propter hoc.* It does show much greater use in the 45 years after the CIA memo, but that could just be due to a generally increase in the prominence of conspiracy theories in American life (the memo came out after the Warren Commission Report, after all) and the gradual, natural popularization of the term. Instead of comparing 45 year chunks, it would be interesting to compare the years immediately before and after the memo was released."}

Even those who claim to be feminist but don't qualify as the whack job nuts you find on twitter and tumblr are told they're not even feminist by \"feminists\" While no true scotsman is definite in high regard here, the reality is that words are defined by contemporary usage. A second factor comes into play. When you have feminists who are of a normal and standard demeanor and belief, one that is simply equality and not lunacy, rape culture, and oppression at every turn, people generally agree with them, by this agreement you find that the general population doesn't see them as requiring a second term to define them because they hold views that are, even if not pronounced, a general consensus. All cases of pejoration of group labels adheres to this, although other caveats may exists. Fundamentalism for example by definition is a strict view of literalist interpretations of the holy books, regardless of religion. Given that this is far removed from even the normal religious groups, it results in this sort of view. It is rare to find fundamentalists who do not hold views that are very much agreeable with the empirical knowledge of the world and as such the view there is likely properly applied and not a bad apple pejoration. With conspiracy theorists you see a similar case as I we did in feminism above. A \"conspiracy theorist\" who discovered Watergate would be seen not as a conspiracy theorist but as an investigative hobbyist/journalist or some other general term, because while it relates to a conspiracy properly, the finding of \"conspiracy\" in general is a quite prevalent thing, as almost every crime involving more than a single person is a conspiracy, and we do not refer to police detectives as conspiracy theorists, though regularly you they apply theories to their work in understanding and routing conspiracy in the criminal world. You have to consider the function language at the root to understand how it works, it isn't so simple as a term becomes a designation to a certain group with its meaning representing the actions of loudest and most radical members, rather you also have to consider what groups the less radical members of the similar belief system / view / whatever belongs to, typically they move away from that designation as they approach the median view point. Other terms such as communist, liberal, and what not, do not have a specific designation, rather they are over generalization pejoratives, which blanket lots are tossed under for the sole purpose of describing it as such typically for a fallacious ad hominem approach to the discourse. These terms generally are not viewed to actually represent any specific set, except when the actual usage is properly used, which is not in favor in the pejorative form."}

I'm great at thinking on my feet and talking to people, but that's not an asset until I get an interview. These are the tactics I've used to get dozens of interviews over the last 5 years in competitive fields, mostly for jobs with a listed degree requirement. *Note that these guidelines are for crafting a custom resume for a specific position. If you are trying to send the same resume to several companies or upload it into a database all of this doesn't necessarily apply. Goal: To convince a manager that you are a worthwhile interview candidate in less than 10 seconds with a Resume and Cover Letter. Of course obvious advice such as not having spelling or formatting mistakes is important, but these strategies can help you stand out of a pile of well-written resumes. 1) Cover Letter (First-person) 1a) First Sentence - The first sentence should be a snappy overview of what you do, your experience, and the assertion that you are excited about the position. E.g. \"I am a front end web developer with more than 8 years of experience and I'd love to bring my skills and enthusiasm to your growing engineering team.\" 1b) Address the cover letter to the hiring manager. This info should be easy to find online or with a phone call. 1c) Body of cover letter - Go beyond the company's website and find out what the company's long term goals and challenges are. Address how you would use your skills to help the goals be met and the challenges overcome. 1d) Tone - Match the tone to the organization. A goofy yet smart cover letter might get your foot in the door at a startup, but a formal letter would be more appropriate for a bank. Looking at how their web copy is written is a good indicator of this. 2) Resume (3rd-person) 2a) Objective - You must mention both a benefit to you and to the company as concisely as possible. Don't just say you want a position at X doing X. E.g. Objective: To obtain a position in data entry where skills in spreadsheet development and troubleshooting can improve efficiency and enhance value. 2b) Key accomplishments and attributes - Not more than 3, maybe 4 bullet points. These are your selling points, make sure they are punchy and desirable. 2c) The rest - Make sure it fits on one page and all relates to the position you are gunning for. Don't include \"will furnish references upon request\" or any other unnecessary clutter. Include multiple forms of contact information. Be specific. Don't use fluff words or phrases, especially in your objective and key accomplishments. Show, don't tell, .e.g. instead of saying \"developed outstanding customer service skills\" say \"served a high volume of customers while offering impeccable service.\""}

Last year my wife and I went to an Adam Sandler comedy tour and Norm was the secret, special comedian guest. The entire time Norm was up on stage, he had a cigarette in his hand. Between jokes, punchlines and a pause he would start to light his cigarette and then at the very last moment stop. He was up there for about 20 minutes or so and he had me hooked. The others, even Spade, Sandler, etc. myself or other audience members would zone out because of bad jokes or dis-interest. IMO, Spade was pretty bad. I realized during Norm's routine how he would use the built up anticipation of lighting his cigarette to keep the audience engaged. At one point towards the end of the sketch, someone in the audience ran up to the stage and offered to light his cigarette to which Norm replied, \"Don't worry, I'm getting there.\" But of course he never did. I don't know if that was staged or not, but at the end, he got the loudest and longest applause of any of the guys, even Sandler, that night. I do monthly training for a decent size group of my colleagues at work whom are around the ages of 23 to 30. I am several years older than them and they tend to zone out, get distracted with their phones or flat out lose interest. I did exactly what Norm did with a cigarette and a lighter (in the office no less) and it worked out beautifully. I've also stated adding BS slide sub-titles that I steal from r/dadjokes and r/shittyaskscience to keep people engaged. I found that no one like to be left out of humor so that has worked very well for me. I never acknowledge the jokes or entertain the questions as to keep the training on track. The passive nature of using humor and semi-anxiety enducing tactics seems to be quite helpful. How can I improve this method? What do you guys do that works?"}

They gave you a range and depending on what route the driver took and how long it took determined what you were charged. Most times there are 2 or 3 reasonable ways to get somewhere. Sometimes one route will be on the highway with a higher average speed but more miles. Another will be fewer miles but driving through towns at lower speed so it takes just as long or longer. The per mile is much higher than the per minute, so under the old system the passenger would pay less for the trip though towns and the drive would get laid less. Under the new system the passenger gets charged the same either way. The difference is on the drivers end with Uber. Taking the more miles, less time route the driver gets more of the fare and uber gets a less than if they had taken the slow fewer miles route. Uber if pretty good at manipulation. Customers finding it less painful was almost a happy accident. They're able to keep a larger portion of a lot of trips now that they don't just take a set percentage."}

I got tired of looking like that. So I figured out a social engineering tip to NEVER let anyone get to you. It’s pretty simple, some people already do this automatically, so this might be common sense for those some. Before I go over the steps, it’s important to realize why people make backhanded comments, jabs and under the table insults. It’s to get you emotional. It’s to get a rise out of you. It’s to get you to get flustered. They do this to gain a sense of control. Think of this way. Negative emotions and control are *inverse*. The more the negative emotions you display, the less control you have. The more control you have, the less negative emotions are displayed. But there’s a bigger problem. If someone is able to get you flustered in a public setting, the snowball starts rolling down the hill. You’ll realize you are flustered. You’ll recognize others see you flustered. You’ll become even more anxious and in your head. Then… You’ll become even more flustered. You’ll look even more flustered in front of others. You’ll become even more anxious than you were before. Rinse and repeat. Now you’ve lost control of the situation. It becomes a nasty cycle. The trick is to never **show** that what was said bothered you. We are only humans, no one is ever 100% confident. It’s more pragmatic to learn how to get around unnecessary comments. In order to do this, you must know exactly how to respond. Here are the exact steps: 1. Catch when someone makes a backhanded comment. Example A: “He’s so much better than you at pickle ball.” Example B: “You really think you are better looking than him?” Example C: “Why’d you wear that?” 2. Figure out which emotion or state of mind arises because of that comment. Example A: Defensiveness Example B: Embarrassment Example C: Insecurity 3. Determine the opposite emotion or state of mind. Example A: Receptiveness Example B: Indifference Example C: Confidence (Example B is not exactly opposite but still works) 4. Respond as if you were feeling that opposite emotion. Example A: *“He really is! His serve is amazing, I need to work on that.”* Example B: Nonchalantly *“Ah yeah, he really is.”* Example C: *“I think I look great!”* This works because you responded in the exact opposite way they expected you to. Most of the times, they won’t know what to say next. They’ll be at a loss for words. You’ll still be in control. If anyone has any other cool methods or how this could be improved would love to hear about it."}

The way the article phrases it is fucked, presumably because the writer has no clue what he's talking about and is likely too busy nursing his fifth Bloody Mary of the day to bother researching and learning anything. The point of setting a goal higher than what you realistically expect to be plausible is to make the actual goal you have in mind an easier swallow for whoever it is that is your benefactor. That said, the essential ingredient here is leverage, and creation of value. If you're just randomly go up to your friend and demand more than he's willing to offer, you'd better have a damn reason he'd want to get involved in your shit in the first place. An example here is a movie director working on a scene he feels would be risque enough to alert any prowling producers, so he goes one step further and creates a \"fall scene\" that he expects to be shot down and afterward clues the producer in on a replacement scene--that scene being the one he really wanted. Also, unless you have anything to offer to people in the first place, I wouldn't be one to worry about someone trying to tool you here. No need to get so defensive about people trying to manipulate you."}

On top of this, a simple acknowledgement of a person's shortcoming may add legitimacy to the flattery. Acknowledge, for instance, that no one is perfect and that everyone has some flaws before giving a compliment and the subject will more likely believe the flattery.

Besides, the point of this isn't to go for preposterous goals that only madmen would believe are acceptable, but to simply aim a bit higher than you'd normally feel comfortable. Your boss shoots it down, you propose your initial idea, they see it's much more reasonable, and both of you get what you want. Sometimes the more \"unreasonable\" proposal manages to slip by, too. I find it hard to believe any businessman or head-on-shoulders type person would find it abhorrent for someone to shoot high and then actively punish the person who dares to try.

In my opinion, the most immoral book I've read is 'Propaganda Technique in the World War' by Harold Lasswell, one of the founders of Political Science. The book was Lasswell's dissertation and has long been out of print (though you can find it on Amazon). It attempts to outline and analyze the massive propaganda campaign carried out during WWI, which is widely regarded as the first modern propaganda campaign because of its reliance on the radio and newspapers in an era of increasing literacy. Just to give one example, in a chapter entitled 'Satanism,' Lasswell outlines how religion is and must be used to define the enemy in any conflict as a 'menacing, murderous, aggressor.' As far as the best book on manipulation, I would suggest Propaganda: The Formation of Men's Attitudes (1965) by Jacques Ellul. While not without its flaws this book remains one of the best attempts to create a comprehensive sociological and psychological theory on the subject. I also do not think that there is just one book on manipulation that could be regarded as the most effective. The modern origins of our ideas about manipulation and propaganda almost entirely developed from the success of The Committee on Public Information in mobilizing public opinion during WWI (see How We Advertised America (1920) by George Creel). The modern advertising industry was formed around the belief that the techniques employed to mobilize public opinion during WWI could also be applied during peace. These ideas were most famously articulated by Walter Lippmann (Public Opinion), Edward Bernays (Propaganda), and Ivy Lee. Terms like 'stereotype' and 'public relations' originated from these men. The term propaganda fell into disfavor after it became associated with Nazi Germany. Public Relations and marketing became the preferred terminology and scholars have been updating and advancing the techniques of opinion manipulation ever since. So at this point, your basic college level marketing textbook could probably be considered the most effective collection of techniques for control and manipulation. Tl;DR: An entry level college marketing text book."}

Holding on to resentment is like drinking poison and hoping your enemies will get sick.", "content": "This post is geared to towards reengineering YOUR social behaviors, and how you respond to social situations - not changing other people's behaviors. **In effect, it might end up changing how other people behave and respond to you, but that is not the goal.** Even still, the reality is your disposition has a huge effect on the dynamic of any interpersonal interaction. Most of us are here because we have felt under-equipped in social situations in the past. Maybe someone insulted us, and we wanted to know how to regain the upper hand through social hacking, or witty quips. Maybe we felt taken advantage of, and we wanted to learn how to avoid manipulation tactics - and even learn how to use them for our benefit. Inevitably though, the goal boils down to one thing: **To leave social interactions feeling more empowered, than you did when you entered them.** **With that goal in mind, I give you the most powerful tip you will ever learn:** Don't take things personally. Everyone is living their own life, immersed in their own story. When people insult you... When your loved ones doubt you.. It's NOT a reflection of you. It's a reflection of them. The next time you talk about someone behind their back or say something that you regret, pay attention. Why did you say it? Was it really about them, or was it about you? Remember your answer the next time you let yourself get offended by someone else's words or opinions. \"Forgive others, not because they deserve forgiveness, but because you deserve peace.\" - Jonathan Lockwood Huie Shifting your perspective on criticism is the most powerful way to strip your critics of their power. [This video]( might help you with this shift. [WATCH HERE]( It is the fastest way to show people you are unoffended by their slights, and for that reason, people will respect you more. It is the bedrock of **being nonreactive** and making people believe you see the best in them. People will rally around and support those are nonreactive and capable of seeing their strength and beauty - not their weakness. They will be willing to be influenced by you, not because you used a technique - but because they want to be influenced by you. They want a world that is lead by a nonreactive leader that holds no grudge against them, because it communicates too things: strength under pressure, and the opportunity for them to be a big part of your future.

So now he’s associated himself in this little battle in Detroit with three of the greatest rappers ever. > Eminem points to random people in the audience and says “You’re Pac, He’s Pac,” including them with himself in associating their lineages with these great rappers. > But then he points to his opponent, Papa Doc, makes a gesture like his head is being sliced off and says, “You’re Pac, NONE”. Meaning that Papa Doc has no lineage, no credibility, unlike Eminem and the audience. My understanding of this scene is nothing like that. He’s calling out Papa Doc’s team as being repeats of generic rappers, “You rap like Tupac, you rap like Tupac, and you rap like Tupac, but Papa Doc barely raps at all.” Borrowing lines from Snoop Dog doesn’t lend him any credibility, I mean, *everyone* and *anyone* could recite those words. Was his credibility based upon, “Hey look guys, I know lines of extremely successful and popular songs out of LA too.” I also thought this was a weak point too: > In a rap battle, (or a sales pitch), if you address everything your opponent can say, he’s left with nothing to say. > When he has nothing to say, the audience, or the sales prospect, your date, your kids, whoever, will buy from you or listen to what you have to say. That's not how sales works. You try to answer your prospects objections, not highlight them to scrutinize. If one wanted to compare this to a sales pitch - it's Eminem talking directly to his client about Eminem's competition saying, \"This is what my competitors will say, and it's true, I'm transparent about mistakes in the past, but we are still a better option.\" It's a technique called disarming. The theory is that it's better if you tell mom your broke the cookie jar than your brother telling your mom. There's probably more I could knit pick, but meh. I gave up."}

Machiavelli guessed it on his book the prince, everyone try to lead a group of his own, from religion to economy, even atheists, everyone try to lead someone. The father lead the family, the CEO lead a company, the mother leads her kids, the employer lead the employees... When you identify and show your cleverness or power to a leader he or she wouldn't stand and share power, control with you. You even the next shining sun or the last moon on a battle field.
