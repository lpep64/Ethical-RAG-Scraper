(Not hard; Texas is the football Vatican.) So (after some additional finagling) I got to spend every Friday night watching football from the pressbox, eating free BBQ, and taking stats. Got to travel with the team, and work out with the guys (which helped my shotput/discus in the spring). A few weeks in, I realized that a handful of local papers would buy HS stats/box scores at about $25 total per week, which kept me in beer money the whole semester. Good times! Really though, if you don't want to *completely* wing it like OP, find a stat-taking program, practice with it a bit at home, and start showing up to games. As a guess, find a paper or website that might be interested in minor local games near you, submit a few stat lines/box scores, even for free. In my experience, if you can get an email confirming they've accepted your stats for publication, have your laptop, scratch pad, and nothing else, there's a decent chance security will let you into the box. And even if they don't, since you have actually legit props, they won't give you a hard time for asking. If there's no security, wait for a quiet moment and knock politely on the door. If there's room most folks are fine with you joining them. But no matter what, KEEP QUIET. I don't mean silent, but you MUST behave professionally or you WILL be asked to leave. Edit: I didn't mean act robotic or anything. Just feel out the room and err on the side of caution, you know?"}

I used them for over two years and saved probably around $2000 and made a bit of additional money by selling small amounts of them occasionally.

Eventually I found an arcade supplier on eBay who was liquidating the exact same generic game tokens that this theater arcade used and I was able to buy THOUSANDS of these tokens for about $25. After that I never had to sit out from the fun, and I was even able to repay the favor to my friends when they would run out before me.

Here's how to get the best chances: Wear something businessy like a suit, casual dress will stand out too much. Try to replicate the other media cards best you can. It's pretty easy to grab a snap of someone else's without being too suspicious. Use public entrance and not staff entrance. Enter sometime near to halfway through the game, all staff and media have to enter through a staff entrance when first showing up at the start of the event. Building on this, engineer a believable lie for you being out there like \"oh I just stepped out like 10 mins ago for a smoke\" Have just the camera in hand and no bag, this way you can avoid bag check and it looks like you have already setup inside. Maybe lower the guards suspicion levels by trying to be fun. Make it obvious you are with media and if they aren't busy, ask them for a quick photo for the event page or something similar, I know a lot of guards that are down for a photo at an event. In contrast, a different approach if you arent very good at being fun is to pretend Ur in a phone call and act busy or in a hurry. Pair all or some of this with confidence to match and you are golden. Once inside, avoid public seating areas as much as possible and don't wonder. Try to hover around out of sight corners on the court or with other media, people out of place is always flagged as suspicious. Bada Bing bada boom. Ezpz, but you didn't hear it from me."}

I thought it was going to be a big event and maybe I could just put on my suit and show up and get into the event. Let me clarify that before I went, I thought it was going to be a big event with a lot of people and I would just sneak in and have a good time. Upon arriving at the hotel where the event was, the CEO of the Christian Science Monitor approached me and asked if I was here for the Bernie Sanders breakfast which was immediately a huge red flag that the event was smaller than I thought but I had already come this far so I said fuck it and told him yes. I went downstairs and this lady asked for my name to see if I was on the list. I gave her my name and was not on the list but I had the invitation for the event forwarded to my phone from my sister and at this point I did a dick move and pretended to be offended that my name wasn’t on the list as kind of a hail mary attempt to get into the event and this poor intern immediately apologized and handed me a copy of the book and asked me to sit wherever I liked. I was one of the first people there so I sat close to where Bernie was going to sit but not right next to him out of fear of getting caught. I was still pretty confident that I would get kicked out before the event started and I was probably more nervous than I’ve ever been in my life because it was just a single long breakfast table. As more journalists walked in, I noticed Andrea Mitchell across from me from the presidential debates and I knew that I was probably the only one there without a wikipedia page. Finally Bernie arrives and shakes everyone’s hand before sitting down and they go around and ask question for an hour about his book and why he lost the election. I didn’t say a word but the lady next to me kept getting mad for asking what he said and I wasn’t listening so I just said “I don’t know” every time. I was also one of the only people there without a laptop typing frantically after everything he said.In my panicked state, I was on snapchat most of the time. On the other side of the table actually there weren’t seats there were just 4 big TV cameras. After the event I managed to get on the elevator with him and since the event was over I told him I was just a college kid and I thanked him for everything and then he just laughed and walked away. This happened a year ago but I was scared of posting it because I never had any proof and the story sounds completely ridiculous but I found the video on C-Span recently and feel more comfortable posting it now that I have proof. This event was November 17, 2016 Edit: proof I'm the guy in the screenshot"}

The owners insisted we were all stealing money out of the till. The truth was the owner’s daughter would walk into the shop, open up the till, take a handful of cash, and leave again. She would also take product w/o paying for it. They didn’t believe us when we told them where the money and product was going. “She knows not to do that, and would NEVER do anything like that.” Well, they installed cameras to watch the till and the shop. It didn’t talk long until they caught her on camera. She kept doing it, but the owners blamed us less. They never apologized. Edit: Fun little more to the story. They ended up letting her work there. She was the worst employee. She would leave the place a disaster area after every shift, wouldn’t do her part of the cleaning, and also pocketed money. She just genuinely had a IDGAF attitude about the whole job. She often made the rest of the staff’s jobs a lot harder when she was there. They shop wanted to try a 24 hour opening in the summer to catch the tourists, public servants, and construction workers that were in our town during the summer. I volunteered to work the 11p to 7a shift since I was 15 at the time, and I stayed up late anyway playing video games and watching “anime.” The shop also had a pretty successful coffee roasting operation on the side and had a couple of roasters in another shop attached to the main cafe. You could see the roasters through a window from the cafe. It was actually a pretty cool setup. Anyway, I worked the same time one of my older adult relatives worked there. They were a roaster, and would have batches going while I ran the espresso machine. They mostly roasted at night because they got complaints when the first started about the smell. (roasting coffee smell something awful IMHO) That way there was always another employee and an adult with me the entire shift. The local PD liked me, so they stopped by all the time and hung out to chat with us or with other officers or just to have a warm place to do their paperwork. It was normally a sweet gig. The day staff were usually on top of their to-so lists, so the deep cleaning I did at night wasn’t so bad. I normally finished my task list about two or so hours after I started my shift. Then, I would just dick around and catch customers as they came in. Easy. However, sometimes when they day shift was slammed the place would take a little longer to clean up. When this happened the day shift was really apologetic, and I understood it happened. I could always tell when the daughter worked. It was horrible. The place would be a freaking mess. She did absolutely nothing to clean up after herself, The soup pots would be baked on because she let them set almost empty and heating all day. The waffle irons from the morning would be left on all day and have batter baked on to a crisp or blacked since she never turned it off. The espresso machine would be an absolute mess. Floors dirty, The whole 9 yards. What finally made me quit was the owners daughter worked the shift before me. (This was during school, and a Saturday. I stopped doing the week day obviously due to being back in school.) I had a band thing that day, so my relative arrived before me. I was getting a ride back from a friend. About an hour before my shift I get a call from my relative telling me they quit for me, and I am no longer working there. Apparently, a customer clogged the toilet in the restroom so bad there was pooburgs floating down the hall. They soaked the carpet and was just disgusting. This happed earlier in the day. Instead of cleaning it, the daughter closes off the hall, and tells the customers the restrooms were out of order. She told my relative that she was going to have me clean it up. No one else cleaned it up either. They just left it for me to clean up and let sit there all day. Well my relative said “Well, that’s where you’re wrong. We quit. I’ll be calling your parents to let them know after I collect our belongings.” I wish I was there to see her face."}

It basically amounted to him finding creative ways to steal from the store, giving everything back, and telling the managers how he did it The easiest methods were: 1. Walk into the back and grab a vest. So many new people are around every day that no one knows who works there 2. Grab some trash bags and a cart. Fill the bags with whatever low cost stuff you want. Bring it to the dumpster out back and throw it away, then pick it up later that night 3. Grab electronics and walk out with a customer, talking with them as you walk out. It'll look like you're bringing it out for them 4. He once even got a checkout person to give him her entire drawer by telling her that there was an issue with fake bills and she needed to hand the drawer over, he'd bring her a new one back right away. Then he walked it out to the car"}

He was the longest working employee there, other than the owner who visited occasionally. I requested for two months for just the footage to be checked and it never was. The cameras were never used for their intended purpose, just to watch employees."}

I worked there for about two years. It’s also entirely possible the person working has given their last fuck and is just waiting for his shift to end. That’s common at Enterprise. I’ve seen more rage quits at Enterprise than any other job I’ve had. Assaulting customers, copy all “Fuck You” emails (the go to favorite), to slow downs and refusal to work while on the clock. Often times Enterprise will fire someone the same day they turn in their 2 weeks notice because of this. When I quit I assumed as much and was surprised they asked me to work the full 2 weeks. My last week I asked if I could just wash cars as I just didn’t want to even look at another customer again. Rental car companies are treated like shit by everyone from the upper management, store managers, body shop personnel, insurance adjusters, and the biggest offender, customers (can you blame them though? Phones ringing off the hook and waiting forever to check in would irritate even Mr. Rogers)."}

The Russians (Putin) tried to kill Alexei Navalny, an opposition leader, and due to the pilots landing and the medical team, the guy survived. People (journalists and Alexei?) were able to figure out a number of people behind the assassination attempt. As no government apparently would do it, Alexei called the assassins himself as a fictional agent to purportedly figure out what went wrong (of course, find out how they tried to kill him). One agent spills the beans for nearly an hour. They turned off the cameras in the hotel Alexei was staying at, rubbed the toxin on an inside seam of his underwear probably when Alexei was swimming, and then when Alexei put them on it absorbed into his skin. On the airplane he fell into a coma. The pilots landed at a Russian airport and doctors stabilized Alexei. After a few days the Russians allowed Alexei to go to a German hospital for some reason. The Germans helped Alexei recover. While Alexei was in a coma, the agents returned to one of the hospitals to take his clothes and clean them of any evidence and put them back, on two different times! He hasn’t got the clothes back though. Then they include photos of some guys on the assassin squad!"}

So I started looking for a new job. I ran across an add for a band director in a little town north of Houston. I've had a small music studio of piano and guitar students since I was 13 so I figured it couldn't be all that hard. &#x200B; I applied and got an interview pretty quick. I'm decent at interviews and had them pretty well convinced I was the guy for the job. Problem was I've never been in any kind of marching or concert band. So when we got to the final set of questions they stated asking some very specific questions relating to how I would run the program. Most of which I had no idea what they where talking about. &#x200B; Instead of panicking, I asked what the previous director had done. They went on and on about how amazing of a job he had done with teaching military style marching band (once again, I had no idea what that meant). With as much enthusiasm as I could muster I told them \"that's a program I can get behind!\". They ended up offering me the job just a few min later. &#x200B; I bought a bunch of marching band books online and learned as much as I could over the next few weeks before school started. It ended up being a great experience. I taught for 2 years and tripled the size of the program all because I acted like I knew what I was doing in the interview!"}

I'm an amateur photographer. I took some editorial photography classes and fell in love with the fashion world immediately. The problem with the fashion world is that it is a tight club where networking is almost as important as talent. To get your book, you need to shoot with make up artists, stylists and professional models. I knew fashion week was coming, there are tons of events around the city and some are free to enter. I decided to go to one and just chat with people. Maybe I could meet someone interesting. I arrived that day and while you could hang in the venue, you needed tickets for the seats in the runway like the photo I posted. There was no way I was getting a ticket, my name wasn't on the list. I saw there was a section for press photographers and there were people with cameras filming interviews. So I unpacked my DSLR, put my biggest lens and sticked to a press crew and no one said anything while entering the press section. I proceeded to take a spot and just shot for the next hour. Now I have tons of material to put on my book and hopefully I can land some fashion runway gigs in the near future!"}

She looked at me again in pure fear. The look in her eye SCREAMED \"please save me\". So I backhanded his hand away from her and said \"get your fucking hand off her\". He started yelling at me, telling me he can put his hand on the \"pole\" if he wants to. Acting like he wasn't just groping this girl. Kept yelling at me for about 30 seconds when I said \"I won't tell this whole subway what you just did if you shut the fuck up and leave her alone\". So he stopped. And the girl BOLTED at the next stop. I stopped a predator that day. I hope she's okay. I hope he stopped doing that. But I can't say I wasn't scared as fuck this guy was going to hurt me. I was in a very cramped place with him. Edit: also forgot to mention I'm a pretty small guy, 5'5. So basically everyone is bigger than me."}

Near where I live there is a marine scrapyard with all kinds of things a guy like me would be interested in (propellers, lifeboats, lake freighters, cargo ships, etc.). One of my childhood favourite ships was scrapped there in 2015. So, with the quarantine pawing at my sanity, I decided to drive out there (2 hours) for shits and giggles. Google Maps showed that the yard was pretty big and barren, with various ships moored awaiting to be worked on, and piles of recycled equipment everywhere. Fun stuff. But, of course, it is an established construction site with hazards galore, so a gangly teenager isn’t going to be able to waltz through unnoticed- so I decided to look the part! Ultimately, I was stopped *just* before making it into the main facility. The lady clearly thought I was somebody who was supposed to be there, she just wanted to know who (contractors had to sign in, as at most worksites such as a scrapyard). I could have totally made up some bullshit to have gotten in, but I would’ve gotten in trouble. So I just immediately came clean and said that I was simply there because I like ships and I wanted to look at them. The lady was actually really impressed and charmed with me and my getup. She said that I was *actually wearing the proper equipment!* She said she would have let me in were it up to her, but sadly, mountains of insurance and safety policies dictated otherwise. She called her manager to ask him if she could let me in, but he said no. She gave me his card and said to call him for some more info. All in all, it was a positive experience. I’m disappointed I didn’t get in, but my outfit was appreciated and I didn’t get arrested. So, yay!"}

People would think you are working as a street artist, which you practically are by that point, you could tell them you are faking being a street artist but it wouldn't matter to them lol. Next up you should try faking being a security guard imo."}
