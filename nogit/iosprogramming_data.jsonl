Started building apps a year and a half ago. AMA.", "content": "I\u2019m going to preempt some of the questions I might receive: \u2022 I\u2019ve built 20 iOS apps since June 2023. Most of them include at least one AI feature, so they are primarily AI-related. I will not share my app links or Apple developer account for several reasons, mainly because it would reveal my full name, address, and phone number. However I\u2019m happy to answer any questions about how I choose which apps to build. \u2022 I had never coded before 2023, but I do have a master\u2019s degree in microengineering from a top European school (so I have strong reasoning skills). I\u2019m 28 years old. \u2022 I\u2019m still not an expert iOS developer but I\u2019ve learned a lot since I started. On average my apps are 60% AI-coded and 40% coded by me. \u2022 I typically work 3\u20134 hours a day, though it\u2019s hard to give a precise estimate. Sometimes, I go weeks without coding due to severe health issues, while other times, I work 15+ hours a day when I\u2019m feeling motivated and healthy. \u2022 I have a social and love life, but I struggle with maintaining a consistent routine (which has always been a challenge for me). I do feel lonely sometimes, as I mostly work alone. Except for the past three months, during which I\u2019ve been working on a more complex app with my friend and co-founder (for this specific app only). \u2022 All of my installs are now organic (ASO only). I had about 50K installs in the past 30 days. Initially, I leveraged my TikTok presence as a tech influencer, posting two videos that each got over 1M views. Those helped me gain 30K installs early on, but my app at the time had barely any monetization. \u2022 I create my App Store screenshots using Figma and design app icons using Midjourney/Flux model with some Photoshop. I don\u2019t pay anyone for design or coding. \u2022 My apps have simple UIs, but they are definitely not \u201cugly.\u201d \u2022 The longest I spent building an app was 3\u20134 months (my first one), while one of my top-grossing apps took just one day to create and publish on App Store Connect. \u2022 ASO (App Store Optimization) is one of the most critical skills for an indie developer without the budget for paid acquisition strategies. \u2022 Twitter is a great place to find like-minded iOS developers who share valuable insights. \u2022 Of the $35K in sales, roughly $30K is net proceeds. After taxes (I live in France), I keep about 15K\u20ac-18K\u20ac for this specific month. \u2022 My API costs are low (thanks to heavy optimization), typically around $150 per month, with a max of $300. Send me your questions, and I\u2019ll try to answer those that I think will be most helpful to you. Just a reminder, everyone can make it."}

As a fellow French, and we often say we don\u2019t appreciate success of others in France, I\u2019m really admirative of both your achievement and the fact that you\u2019re willing to share. Your post is really on time, I\u2019m leaving my job to try the solopreneur and indie dev life. Now, since you\u2019re offered, here are my questions, hoping I\u2019m not too late to the party (I read all your other answers so I\u2019ll avoid duplicates) 1. How did the revenue evolve over time? Especially at the beginning? What is pretty much linear or did it somehow pick up at some point? 2. About your apps that don't or didn't work out, do they make 0 or at least a little bit of money? 3. You make only iOS apps? No Android counterpart? 4. When looking at charts to pick up your next app, do you focus only on AI apps? Do you care if there\u2019s too much competition or if a market is saturated? 5. Speaking of which, many apps on SensorTower are marked as below 5K, but I found out that sometimes that might be wrong. What's the number that makes you think ok this is a good niche? In my experience there are always apps marked <5K. 6. When you chose a target, do you do extensive research on the competition? Features, pricing, UI/UX, onboarding etc. 7. Do you use a hard paywall for your IAP or offer some free features? Do you offer free trials? How do you determine your IAP tiers? Do you use things like Superwall, RevenueCat and analytics to tweak the onboarding and optimize conversion rate? 8. Where and how did you learn ASO? 9. Do you feel like AI is still a viable niche? Are there other niches? How to find them? 10. Do you think it's possible to pick up steam without a social media presence like you had? Only through organic ASO? 11. In indie deve and solopreneur circles it is said that 85% is marketing. What's your marketing strategy? Only ASO, nice screenshots and nice description? 12. What is your legal status in France when it comes to that? SASU at least I suppose, which means you collect VAT. So according to what you said with $1 of IAP, 30 cents go to Apple, 20 cents to VAT, and then you roughly keep half of the fifty cents left right? 13. I'm interested in the Twitter accounts list as well I\u2019m aware there are a lot of questions, so if that\u2019s too much, I would happy to chat in DM in a more relaxed way. But I would really really appreciate your help in my new endeavor since you\u2019re pretty much doing what I\u2019m dreaming to do. Cheers mate."}

Don\u2019t worry about the haters as they are looking in the mirror and understanding they are not capable of achieving anything remotely close. Also, people who are criticizing you for building an app in one day don\u2019t understand that: 1. Acquisition is more important than development if you want to make money. That is why, most devs are salty here as they have no clue about marketing or ASO. Speaking as a developer who shipped 60+ apps myself for clients. 2. App MVPs should never take more than 3-4 weeks in this day and age. If you are doing it longer, you are unlikely to make any money as your priorities are still about development not about actual business.

Are you mainly focusing on picking the right keywords for your titles/subtitles, or do you also iterate on screenshots and icons a lot to improve conversion? 2. You said each of your apps includes at least one AI feature. Do you usually rely on external APIs (like OpenAI), or did you train any custom models? And how do you manage user data/trust with so many AI-driven features? 3. You mentioned building an app in a day vs. 3-4 months. Do you have a sense of how you pick which ideas to go all in on, and which ones to just spin up quickly? 4. Are you mostly using subscriptions or one-time purchases? I\u2019m always curious how other devs structure in-app purchases (especially with AI overhead)."}

Begun exploring AI-powered consumer apps. 3. Learn various marketing skills like video production, image editing, ... Initially, I thought organic traffic from social media would be enough to drive installs. After trying TikTok, Instagram, YouTube, and more, I found little success.

Heck, recently I tried to feed ChatGPT a simple 100-page PDF file and asked it to extract all email addresses from it, it failed spectacularly (instead of hundred-ish I got only about 20 emails) so I had to do it by hand just to be sure not to miss any...

All the users of my apps are happy with the apps I made. My apps address a real problem, and AI solves it much better than traditional methods. Why do some people think that all AI apps are low-effort? You can\u2019t be successful with that mentality. Wish you the best! Edit : I see that a lot of people downvoted me, so let me try to explain why I\u2019m defending myself. Yes, some of the apps I\u2019ve built didn\u2019t take me a long time, but most of them took more than just one day. Several apps required significant effort and long coding sessions. Most of my apps are not just \u201cAI wrappers,\u201d as people seem to think, some don\u2019t even include AI at all. Additionally, for the apps that did take only a few days to build, if I hadn\u2019t applied the ASO (App Store Optimization) knowledge I\u2019ve acquired over the past year and a half, there\u2019s no way they would have made a significant amount of money. I encourage you to try building an app in a day and see for yourself if it\u2019s really that simple to make money or generate revenue. Contrary to what many people seem to think, my goal was not to brag about how much I made but to show that success as an indie developer is possible. I also wanted to share my knowledge and experience on the strategies for optimizing app development, monetization, ASO, and so on, things I wish I had known when I started. I also suffer from severe tinnitus. I\u2019ve been working on an app for tinnitus sufferers for months now, which I plan to release for free in hopes of helping others with the same condition. I wouldn\u2019t call that a low-effort app either. My ultimate goal in building apps is to help people and bring them joy, not to be the greedy or \u201cevil\u201d person some have implied. I don\u2019t care about the downvotes; I just want to clarify a few things: 1. It is possible to make money on the App Store. 2. You don\u2019t need AI in your apps to make money, my highest-grossing app does not feature AI. 3. In this day and age, not using AI to build and optimize development processes is in my opinion a mistake. However, if you prefer to build your app without AI assistance, you absolutely can. 4. You cannot build a good iOS app and publish it on the App Store without some coding knowledge. 5. \u201cAI wrappers\u201d are not a shortcut to making money. Many AI-wrapper apps will fail, just as many traditional apps will fail."}

I will answer your first seven questions, then go to sleep. I'll try to answer the rest in the next few days. 1. It was pretty much linear since I started. I made less than $100 in the first two months, then it started to grow because I had more and more apps under my name. 2. All of my apps that have a subscription (some of my apps are free) make at least $10\u2013$20 a month. 3. Only iOS apps as of now. 4. I don't focus only on AI. I build AI apps because I find them really useful. I don't care much about the competition aspect of my app\u2019s niche. if my app is well made, at least a few users will download it. 5. When picking a niche, I usually try to find at least one app that makes more than $5K. In Sensor Tower, \"<$5K\" means they don\u2019t know the exact number except that it's below $5K. 6. I normally do a lot of research. I download all the competitive apps and check which features I like or dislike. 7. I never have a hard paywall in my apps because I'm against that. As of now, I'm not using RevenueCat or Superwall, but I\u2019m considering trying them. 8. By building apps, reading a lot of articles on the internet, and then building more apps again. 9. AI is a viable niche, just like traditional apps. As long as your app is good and your ASO is decent, you should get some downloads. 10. Yes, I\u2019m sure of that. The only app I advertised a year ago is now *\"only\"* making $1K, so the rest of my revenue comes purely from organic installs (from ASO). 11. Yes, yes, and yes. And a good product, of course. 12. Nope, for now, I can still keep my microentreprise (but this will be the last year I\u2019m eligible). 13. I still haven\u2019t made the list, but I'll update you when I have time. You should easily find many interesting iOS developers by searching on Twitter. Once you do, the Twitter algorithm will automatically show you the most liked posts in the iOS community. Okay, well, it was better to finish all the questions this way. Good luck! :)"}

I downloaded DJokes. Nice work! It has some issues though: \\- none of the screenshots tell me anything about how the app works, or what the benefit is \\- the few jokes I scanned in the screenshots were not great jokes tbh \\- After starting the app I am immediately asked to create an account, something I don't really want to do - I don't want to share email and such - but there is ZERO information about what I get with an account. So I didn't do it. \\- And now I can't use the app. So, I downloaded your app, learned nothing about it, and after the create account screen, didn't use it. Suggestions: \\- your screenshots MUST illustrate the value of the app, visually if possible but add some text if you must \\- provide some sort of functionality so people can try the app without giving up information or money, before you hit them with the \"create account\" screen \\- clearly explain what they get with an account, i.e. why they should part with that information. Otherwise most won't do it. Good luck!"}

My process is simple; I look at the top chart in the US App Store (in all the categories) to see if some of these apps are easy to build and if they are making some decent money. I now build my MVP in about a week or so, so now there are no more heavy investments. The only big investment now is the app I'm building with my friend, but that's outside of the indie scope as I'm planning to do a huge marketing campaign and many other things to bring in some users. 2. My apps are easily maintained. Most of them don't require any backends. I only hide my different API keys using Cloudflare workers. So I definitely have time to build new apps. The only time I spend on older apps is to build more features on my profitable ones. 3. The tech stack is quite straightforward. Mostly SwiftUI (UIKit only when necessary), for the backend (when there is one, which is rare) Firebase/Firestore. I usually use the OpenAI API for my apps. 4. I will let you decide on that one :p 5. I'll do my list ASAP and will send you another message."}

If the program is a black box whereby the developer relies on the AI to maintain, understand how it works, and fix upcoming issues for them, for example, I will want absolutely nothing to do with said app or developer. I am not paying someone for an accomplishment that isn't theirs. Nor do I have guarantees that they could create the same app if left to their own devices. They blindly accept becoming a machie's pet. Instead of understanding what's under the hood and acquiring analytical and critical skills to understand and provide support for their app long into the future, they would instead leave their clients at their AI's mercy once the tiniest failure occurs. - Can you fix something affecting 2 million clients and costing the company $2000/minute? - Hold on, let me ask my AI. Nope, sorry, it turned the app into a picture of an elephant instead. - Oh, that function is static and the methods being called require an object reference? I asked ChatGPT to figure it out but it simply turned it into an arrow function with the same error. It's not my fault I chose to shortcut my way into this position and left you in such dire circumstances, Mr. Client. Although I fully earned being in this predicament, you're on your own now. Good luck. It's irresponsible and unethical towards your consumers, at best. It can set up both you and them for a potentially catastrophic failure down the road. On top of teaching you that shortcutting your way to false accomplishments is okay, it also doesn't teach you how to provide accountability when something goes wrong. It can leave you in a position where it's easier to run off and away from the people you scammed, who are now demanding said accountability that you can't provide. The developer might as well go looking for an alternative to their jaw and teeth, so it can chew their food for them. It's just as negligent and shortsighted."}

The sad part is that now a person that is passionate about something real with a much higher level of skills than the author has to think \"do I continue or should I switch into making trendy soulless apps just because they bring money\". It is like making reskins of match 3 games. Am I jealous that they made 1000 times the same game with different visuals and made millions? No. But that is sad because nobody normal is gonna wanna reskin simple game 1000 times. Only people that don't care about anything but money want to do that.

I currently don\u2019t market my apps, except for optimizing ASO as much as I can. I\u2019ll try to provide a detailed explanation of my ASO strategy, but I\u2019m definitely less motivated after all the negative comments on my post. As of now, I don\u2019t rely on any platforms like TikTok or paid ads. 2. I think having a hard paywall is a bad idea for two reasons. First I personally don't like hard paywalls so I don\u2019t want to contribute to the increase of such apps. Contrary to what people might think my main goal isn\u2019t to make as much money as possible, I just love building apps. The second reason is that when you rely solely on organic downloads, a hard paywall can lead to most users deleting the app immediately. This negatively impacts ASO rankings, as Apple\u2019s algorithm interprets high uninstall rates as a sign that users don\u2019t like the app. From my experience, retention rate is crucial for ASO ranking. 3. What I\u2019m actively trying to do is create app concepts similar to those that are already successful while adding a feature that I consider important but haven\u2019t seen in any of the apps I\u2019ve analyzed. I also build apps that I personally want and will use. If your app is unique, go for it! The way I validate my app ideas is by creating a quick MVP (taking no more than a month or two to build) and tracking user reactions and the number of downloads. Then, I evaluate whether it\u2019s worth continuing. However I\u2019m the kind of person who believes that if you truly think your app idea is great, you should double down until it works.

This is allowed only for ai providers themselves. I didn't see what your apps are about because you don't show them but making so many apps in a short period of time says a lot about them already. If they are AI then you just call chatgpt or any other ai provider with some request and give it back to a user. User could do the same using that ai provider directly. Can you give an example of what added value app has? The only relief people that hate AI wrappers have is that trendy apps are short lived. Authors still make a ton of money in that short period but at least to keep making more they have to always spin and make new things like on a conveyor trying to satisfy a new short lived trend"}

I even touched a bit of SwiftUI before taking a job for a greenfield project in Flutter. I was very negative in the interview when they told it was gonna be Dart/Flutter and some parts native if a library needed to become a flutter plugin. But the tech lead told me to try Flutter for a bit and I rewrote a small app I had as a showcase for best practices. I was simply amazed and a little bit mad at Apple for how smooth development was in a VSCode setup with the proper plugins. I mean Flutter has mocking libraries for fucks sake, only that alone saves you hours of dredging through writing tests or maintaining them. Also in terms of performance I guarantee you cannot tell at all if you know what you\u2019re doing with flutter. It uses a different renderer and it\u2019s not trying to translate what you\u2019re writing back into the native code like other cross platform libraries. And outputting for Android is just the cherry on top. Even SwiftUI is just copying what Flutter does with UI and I\u2019d say flutter does it even better. I will be sad to see it go if it ever does(Google does not seem to care a lot these days sadly) because it\u2019s a superior experience definitely to iOS native development. At this point I\u2019m keeping up with native development just for job security in case Google decides to fuck it all up."}

RealityKit is for renderer with stuff like occlusion, shadows, multiuser synchronization, lighting, sound and Entity Component System for Virtual Content to make things look more real, faster, and easier to work with built in. There is an overlap with their functionality when it comes to anchors since RK has its own way of handling it which definitely will cause confusion. ARkit itself is getting better with each version."}

Having the network calls and preparation in the view controllers is bad architecture. Why is the view controller responsible for setting up the network call? Service? Settings? etc. The network layer should handle that. The view controller should then only be calling the service and return back data to use and that's it. For example, I have a class called `SWNetworkServiceManager`. It handles the network calls, data authentication, etc. using Firebase. To use it, all I have to do is: 1. Make a `SWNetworkServiceManager` property in the view controller. 2. Call the sendRequest method of that property and send any relevant data. 3. Check in completion if it worked; if it did, then I can use the data it returned. That's it. The actual authentication, data check, etc. is handled by the `SWNetworkServiceManager` because that is the one intended for network logic. The only thing the view controller does is: 1. Make the network call. 2. Handle the response data. That's it. It's separating unnecessary logic/responsibility away from the view controller. The network logic is encapsulated into its own place. If there is some network issue, I know immediately where to go. The view controller code looks like this. So imagine how much space I'm saving in each view controller by not having the network logic in them: networkService?.sendRequest(withData: [\"email\": email, \"password\": password]) { (didSucceed, _) in guard didSucceed else { return } SWAppDefaults.isSignedIn = true self.getGrades() } Meanwhile the actual logic of the network service (sign in) in the service manager is: private func signIn(with data: Any?, completion: @escaping (Bool) -> Void { guard let data = data as? [String: String] else { completion(false) return } let email: String = data[\"email\"] ?? \"\" let password: String = data[\"password\"] ?? \"\" Auth.auth().signIn(withEmail: email, password: password) { (result: AuthDataResult?, error: Error?) in guard let result = result, error == nil else { ACAnimatedBannerView.display(message: error?.localizedDescription ?? SWCopyDeck.Error.genericNetwork, bgColor: SWStyleKit.primaryRed) completion(false) return } SWUser.current.email = email SWUser.current.uid = result.user.uid completion(true) } } Thanks to my service class, all the network calls in the log [look like this]( So I always know what the request was and response every time for every network call (service) when I'm running my app."}

Trying to speed up the time so that I can get the summary of a 30 min video in 2 min.

There should be 20 million people right now looking for apps, and finding just what they want in the app store, but that doesn't happen because it's all spammed up.

It works out because they get enough data to work with, that they can figure out what to buy. They can buy in bulk and can control their terms. ---------- Think about you wanting to buy a loaf of bread. Compare that to a grocery store chain that buys 50,000 loaves of bread each week. The grocery store is going to be a large customer and the bread company will have a vested need to see that they are happy. Both the bread company and the grocery store will never even know if they lose you as a customer because you only buy the one loaf of bread. In business school, years ago, there was a case study about how Japan handles this. If you want to become a supplier to a company in Japan, they would look at how you do business, and invest in your company so that they KNOW you will be able to provide the goods. I worked for a company that was going thru a merger. The larger company installed THEIR accounting team in order to make sure our books weren't cooked. ----------- Compare an indie dev, to a single sporting goods store. Now compare if 5,000 sporting goods stores grouped together and started buying huge chunks of ads and did all kinds of promotions. The costs per ad would be a lot smaller. Now compare that to a company that knows how to make a profit from their ads, vs an indie that is just trying things out. One of my first projects out of college was an advertising management software package."}

The fact that this is still even a thing (and it very much is), is a sign that simply using Swift isn't a slam dunk. That and other things tend to cause businesses some hesitation in adopting it. Really need it to be functionally on-par with Obj-C, and stable. Living on the cutting edge is fun for devs who get to play with that, but headaches for managers and businesses when it inevitably burns them. There's really no reason that Swift should still be that immature after all these years, but here we are. As for the other points, given how widely Obj-C still exists in iOS and will continue to do so for some time, a professional iOS developer needs to be able to work with both. We don't have to like it, but that is the reality. You keep calling Obj-C outdated and those developers stubborn, but it's still a supported first class native language for iOS, so I'd say people who refused to learn anything other than Swift are quite stubborn themselves. Plenty of stubbornness to go around. Personally, I like to hire devs who are hungry to learn new things, and not stubborn assholes who are set in their ways and will waste my time arguing everything."}

Doesn't mean I have to like all of it, or that I don't think some of it is a mess. With experience, you tend to develop opinions and a desire to avoid repeating certain headaches. Choose the right tool for the job. Sometimes that's a new shiny tool, sometimes not. Like I said, and the whole point that you keep trying to get around, is that Obj-C continues to exist as a first class language on iOS because it still has a place and is needed. It's not just for cranky old devs who would otherwise be writing COBOL, but nice attempt trying to dismiss it as something like that. If you've been doing this since 2012 and are concerned about the job market as an iOS staff developer, I'd have to ask where you went wrong."}

Here\u2019s my advice. Getting into it this late can be really intimidating. Stick with it and some day you will suddenly realize you\u2019ve got a decent handle on the basics. Don\u2019t bother with Interface Builder. Do everything programmatically. You can only do some things programmatically, IB obscures important details, and IB makes a mess of your git commits (especially if you have other team members working in parallel branches). If you\u2019ve already got some UI laid out in IB, leave it as it is. You can redo it later if needed. The way layouts work on iOS are different than the other few UI toolkits I\u2019ve worked with (which are mostly similar to each other). They\u2019re unintuitive but they will eventually click with enough experience. Just expect to have some frustrating sessions trying to understand why your layout doesn\u2019t work the way you expect. There\u2019s probably some flag you\u2019re not yet familiar with. Some of the most common views have special behavior depending on their parent view. When you want to add a child to a view, you add it to the subviews. Unless it\u2019s a UIStackView, in which case that will quietly not work like you expect. Add them as an arranged subview. Always include \u201cswift\u201d whenever you look up any tutorial. If it\u2019s not in Swift, it\u2019s outdated in at least a few ways. Don\u2019t bother with SwiftUI for the next couple years (or any other brand new component until it\u2019s had a few major releases). This means you won\u2019t get featured in the App Store but you weren\u2019t going to be anyhow. The upside is you\u2019ll save yourself a lot of headache dealing with unpolished API and UI in Xcode. Good luck!"}

SwiftUI is fast at the expense of a runloop. You can add your own runloop, however, you wind up with 2x the code as UIKit, so it\u2019s a moot point. SwiftUI is very good for visualizing static data, such as a JSON response from a REST API. I would use SwiftUI for sports scores, a social media site like Instagram, a file browser, or an App Settings interface. All of these apps mostly use static data, unless the user refreshes. When you get into time-based things like DJ software or video editors, you have to write your own runloop at 2x the code. If your data doesn't change frequently, I would use SwiftUI."}

I remember how lost and confused I was when I first started, so I wanted to share what I wish I had known when I started. For the **TL:DR**, here's the list of what a beginner should learn and in what order: \\-1) **Views**: Learn UIKit and how to programatically set up your views. You should be able to recreate a collection view and familiarize yourself with layers, animations and draw(). Learn the difference between writing with gpu and cpu. Learn some swiftUI, however I personally have noticed most jobs haven't transitioned fully or at all to swiftUI, hence the focus on programmatic views. \\-2) **Network Calling**: Learn how to interact with a restAPI using URLSession. You should be able to GET and POST to an endpoint. Learn and know how to get a list from any API. \\-3) **Data Persistence**: Learn UserDefaults, KeyChain, FileManager, CoreData and CloudKit \\-4) **MultiThreading**: Learn DispatchQueue, GrandCentralDispatch, Async-Await, OperationQueues \\-5) **Architecture**: Master delegates and protocols, MVVM, Facade Pattern, Dependency Interjection. Properly use guard statements / optional unwrapping and learn about Automatic Reference Counting \\-6)**Frameworks**: have fun with this one, Apple has so many cool frameworks but definitely get familiar with basic ones like AVFoundation, MapKit, etc. \\-7)**Objective**\\-C: spend a few hours making an app with a collection view that gets a list from the internet in Objective C so you can say you\u2019re familiar with it. By following this roadmap and learning everything above you\u2019ll be able to make any app / be prepared for a job as an official developer. An iOS Developer essentially (1)makes views, (2)gets data from the internet for the views to display, (3)saves the data, (4)handles the data properly so your views don\u2019t get backed up, (5)organizes code and (6) uses different frameworks to get everything going. That\u2019s iOS development in a nutshell. By having this as a foundation you should be able to tackle anything that comes your way. **Tips & Resources:** \\- NEVER download xCode from the app store, always download it from the developer portal:([ \\- Download SF Symbols for system Images already built in to your app (no more cropping images you google): [ \\- use this to create your apps icon instantly, all 30 different sizes: [ \\- A good website for copying colors when paired with photoshop: [ \\- an awesome JSON viewer for api's: [ \\- POSTMAN: a must have when working with rest API's: [ **Where To Start:** **- No Programming Experience:** If you've just been interested in programming and have zero knowledge, I highly recommend downloading unity and doing their roll-a-ball tutorial and completing their other intro tutorials ([ If you're asking yourself, \"If this is about iOS development, Why would I start with Unity, Isn't that C#? Shouldn't I learn Swift? I don't care about game development\". Well, alternatively you can use apples playgrounds to learn as well ([ However, I cannot attest to it since it wasn't around when I started learning, so you can still try the Unity method as I did. As for Unity, which runs with C# instead of swift; C# and Swift are both Object-Oriented Programming languages (OOP). That means they're similar. By learning one, the other is extremely simple to grasp. But why Unity and game development? Learning coding by yourself can be hard and frustrating, especially when staring at plain text book answers all day. Following along with youtube videos or trying to decipher what StackOverflow is showing you can be stale and daunting. When you start with video game development, you get amazing visual feedback as to how your code is affecting what you're trying to do. For example, If I tell you \"By iterating over an array you can get access to all the references in that array and manipulate them accordingly\", that may seem intangible to someone with no programming knowledge. However, In video game development, you can see that by iterating over this array, and by attaching a grenade to each of these items, you're going to get explosions everywhere. It is, simply put, more fun and teaches you to not be afraid to break, test and stress your code. Another example, Text Book: \"When you create a variable you're creating an instance or a reference to that object in memory\". When you do that in game development, it simply creates a character, bullet, tree / whatever you want and puts it into the [game.]( You'll see that all that simply means is you're creating something so you can reference it late. My point is, video game development is a more engaging and visual way to learn. Unity has excellent tutorials that will give you a foundation for programming where you have none. The main tools for your foundation being: Referencing objects, Arrays, Sets, Dictionaries, Value vs References, if-statements and more. Unity should get those grounds covered and fast. Once you're done learning some coding basics in Unity, or done with playgrounds then its time to get straight to the point with some good old fashioned YouTube Tutorials! **Welcome to tutorial hell:** It's time to start making your first mobile applications! This is going to be difficult, because you're going to be following along and not really understanding what you're watching. But don't worry! Follow along and eventually it will stick. As you follow along with these tutorials don't be scared to stop, take a breather and digest what you've learned. The best way to learn and digest what you're watching is to BREAK your code. You're going to see a lot of UICollectionViews, UITableViews and more. Don't be shy to play with things. Set counts to 1000, make the background of a view a different color using cell.backgroundColor = .red. This isn't a 'you follow along and you're done'. Much like learning through game development, tutorials should be a hands on, test everything you're curious about, break everything experience. Here's some youtubers and their series I owe my career to: ***Brian Voong:*** **LetsBuildThatApp** Brian Voong is a gem when it comes to following along and learning to create amazing UI with UIKit programmatically. I recommend starting off with building twitter, youtube or any of his other tutorials. He'll show you how to set up collection views that can be reused. [** &#x200B; ***Sean Allen:*** **SeanAllen** Sean Allen has a talent for explaining swift concepts in an easy to understand way. It's been years and I still recall his star wars example every time I set up a delegate. [ &#x200B; ***iOS Academy:*** **iOSAcademy** iOS academy covers a large range of topics, and usually when I search for a how to on maps or another subject, I can be sure I'll find a video that will break down what I need. [ &#x200B; **Paul Hudson:** ***Hacking With Swift*** Not a youtube channel, but Paul Hudson has been a front lines teacher with a great collection of books and resources. As you google your problems, rest assured hacking with swift will be one of the top results. His 100 days of swift, although it wasn't quite for me since I discovered him later in my career, is a valuable tool for newcomers. He has also appeared on John Sundells podcast *Swift By Sundell* and is a joy to hear talk. [ There's many more online teachers who have had a hand in guiding the next generation of iOS developers, and many more who have helped me as well, all it takes is a quick search. But **be warned**. Online mentors aren't the end all be all, and what they show you is geared towards beginners. They offer you hand holding for your first steps, and to get better eventually you'll have to search for more advanced topics on these intro tutorials. When you get more experienced, go back on what you've learned and ask yourself, whats the next step? **What is tutorial hell and how do I escape it?** Tutorial hell is what beginners describe as being stuck watching tutorials and feeling like they haven't learned anything. You can follow along and recreate twitter, youtube, instagram, etc and feel like you don't know what to do if you're left with a blank xCode Project. So how do you avoid this cycle? Simple! Build your own app. That's it! After you watch some tutorials on how to recreate some apps, it's time to get your hands dirty and bring your own idea to life. However, DO NOT GET HUNG UP ON YOUR APP IDEA. Don't overthink it, your app doesn't have to be perfect or even geared to a release on the store. Pick any app on any subject and just make it! Make a blank project and just start coding, and googling everything you need to know along the way. The foundation you got from watching tutorials will give you the knowledge of what to google as you go along. You know what a collection view is, you know you need it for your app but you don't remember how to implement it. Thats fine! Just google it, get it working in your project and move on to the next step! The first app I ever made was a delivery application for medical marijuana complete with a shop, driver delivery tracking and payments with Stripe. It took 6 months to make and when all was said and done, it looked pretty okay! Underneath the hood was a garbage fire, but what I learned with that project allowed my next app to be a little less of a garbage fire. It doesn't matter if you're doing something right or wrong, just get it working. The knowledge you gain is worth the abomination you may create. Here's some projects that are a must to complete so you have a solid understanding: A real time chat application using firebase. A map application using Mapkit A to do list using coredata A music playing app using AVFoundation A picture taking app with filters. **Want to learn FAST? Don't have time to sit and make a whole app? Still not feeling like you know what you're doing? Speed Code!** What made me feel confident in my ability to code is by practicing what I call 'Speed Coding'. This is my personal practice of picking an app, any app, then spending the next few hours making it as quick as I possibly can. With your personal project, you may make a collection view once in 6 months (like what I did when I made my delivery application), however, when you speed code you make a dozen collection views in a week. Everything sticks better by doing! The goal is to figure out what you know and what needs to be worked on. As you speed code, remind yourself you're on a timer. Anything you cant google or write in about 10 minutes, skip and move on to the next part you're trying to recreate. When you finish, go back to what stalled you and study it. For example, you may have made the views quickly, but when it came time to animate a menu slider you got lost some time. Go back and spend the time on how to implement that. When you plan on speed coding, choose different areas that you might want to work on. Speed coding really helps with setting up UI, but it's great for network calls as well. Google a list for a free weather api, movie showtimes api, list of presidents, amazon api and integrate those into your speed coding so you can get practice making a lot of network calls as well. Here's a list of apps I've recreated that really helped me grow: *QuickBooks, LTK, Instagram, Youtube, Spotify, DoorDash, PostMates, BankOfAmericaApp, SnapChat, Pinterest, FanDango.* Not only do you get experience, but you kick start your portfolio! **GitHub Time!** Congratulations, if you've done the previous steps, you've got some experience under your belt. You may not feel like it, but you've become a competent programmer. Now it's time to take all the projects you've recreated and worked on and put them on to GitHub. GitHub is a useful online tool where you can upload your projects and keep them updated without fear of losing them. GitFlow is an industry standard and it's routinely used to push updates to your application. Not only is it useful for making sure you don't lose your application, but can also revert any changes you made to your app that completely caused it to break,. You can use your GitHub to show employers projects you've worked on. Learn how to add your projects to GitHub and how to check out a branch on a project and push an update. **Whats Next? I've Done The Projects and Want To Interview, But What Do I Need To Know To Be Ready?** Here's a secret, rarely anyone feels 'ready' when it's their time to interview. And interviewing is more of a skill nowadays than it is a way to gauge your programming. But by going over the list of what to know, and by reviewing your projects these interviews will be a walk in the park. **STUDY GUIDE I MADE WHEN I LOOKED FOR A JOB:** [ Above is the study guide I made, printed, and looked over repeatedly while looking for a job. I would spend a few hours a day learning every question and answer. If you can answer those questions and go in depth about them, then you're ready. To be honest, when I started studying for my interview it showed me where some gaps in my knowledge were, so don't feel dissuaded if you can't answer any of these off the top of your head. Just look them up as you study and learn a little more. **Getting professional experience for your resume:** So you know how to make an app, you've studied enough about swift and you have a few apps under your belt. If you released an app to the store, you can stop here and start your job search. However, if you want to add some experience to your resume then follow along. How do you solidify your abilities to find that foot in the door? Find someone who wants an app! This part is usually the most daunting to developers, getting your foot in the door by having professional experience for a company makes job hunting that much easier. Dont stress about getting that first job to help find your dream job, it's easier than you think. What I did to find professional experience was simple: I messaged UI Designers on freelancing websites and asked them If I could recreate their designs in xCode and give them the completed application. The UIDesigners loved this, since they got a free, working and animated native application and I got resume experience. They would send figma files and I would recreate the app. From there a few of them actually recommended myself to some of their clients! If you cant build that relationship, you can also find a local shop that might want an iOS app. Visit the strip in your town and visit small shops and ask them if they would like a free iOS app! Let them know that usually an app costs around $34,000 but you need experience and would be happy to make them for free. (An unethical tip: Tell them you're a student and you need to create an app for your thesis. It makes you seem less scam-artist and sketchy). It helps to get a small shop on board if you already have a prototype to show them on your phone. However, you should be able to find a business or a UI Designer that wouldn't mind you making a mobile application. From there, you have your first job (albeit, an unpaying one) as a professional iOS developer and instantly become 10x more appealing to employers. Put the job on your resume, and when it comes time to job hunt, you don't need to reveal that you weren't paid and did the job as a resume builder. Simply saying that you worked for x company or x-designer as an iOS developer will do. **The Job Hunt:** If you're looking for your first job, you've probably noticed that there's not many jr. iOS Positions available, and the internships are designed for college students. What you're not told is that the market for jr. developers is slim. The solution? Apply to normal development jobs. Think of the job listings as a wish list, and the employers post their ideal candidate. However, often their expectations are much lower. That being said, don't be shy to apply to every job opportunity you see. Getting experience doing interviews is invaluable, even for jobs you know you won't get. If it gives you any comfort, I too applied to jobs before I was ready while simultaneously being deathly afraid of interviews. I've bombed so many interviews so horribly I bet the recruiters still laugh about it to this day. For example, one time I was doing an interview and was asked to create a delegate. I had made 100's of delegates at this point, but I was so nervous doing interviews that my mind went blank. I proceeded to google how to make one on my phone, answered the interviewer in full confidence and they responded with, \"uh, that's how you make a delegate in objective-c, not swift\". They knew I had googled my answer on a question that should have been a conversation starter. I was so embarrassed I just said, \"Thank you for your time\" and hung up. But with each failed interview I grew more confident, and eventually this confidence grew to the point where It showed and I saw myself in the final rounds of interviews often. A tip I learned for a confidence boost is that before the interview, pretend that you've already received an offer from another company and that you're doing this interview to keep your options open. One tip I recommend that helped immensely in getting to the final round of interviews is recreating the mobile app for jobs I really liked. When I received a response from a company I was interested in, I would download their app and recreate the core features in xCode and send a link with a short clip (using streamable) and the GitHub link to the hiring recruiter over linked in. I nearly always saw myself in front of the companies engineer afterwards. Another interview tip I used is that when I was asked, \" What do you look for most in a job?\" I would respond with, \"My end goal is to always grow better at developing. I want to find a job with strong senior programmers to help me grow my trade and guide me to better work in a team. Specifically I want to learn how to make enterprise scalable architecture.\" Always have a strong opinion on a framework ready as well. I would like to bring up the struggles I have working with CoreLocation and MapKit. I would talk about how for getting a user location it's better to startUpdatingLocations, than it is to requestUserLocation because it's faster. When requesting a user location, it can take a while, however you can user startUpdating, create a location variable optional, set that that variable with startUpdatingLocation, then when the location variable is set, you use stopUpdatingLocation. This way, if you have a gps button the user doesn't have to wait a few seconds to get their location. Small details like this show how you can work around api to increase user experience. **Final Note:** I've been writing this on my lunch break and I know this guide is incomplete, and I'm not necessarily a word smith so i'll be sure to update this post if anyone seems interested. If you have any questions or want some help, feel free to comment or message me!"}

Also get familiar with Jira, and Agile. Learn how to create a ticket and what a PR is and how to create/review one. Expectations are usually one commit a day. Also make sure you can write unit tests.

For now getting by watching YouTube videos, googling it etc. Sometimes I feel targeted training and research has kinda helped me and of course me saving plenty of codes in notion so I can review them later to see everything ties up has been a game changer and expedited my learning but apple docs to figure things out on my own has been a nightmare.

I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re just a dev and not much more so you don\u2019t understand the feel of apps. You may not take things into consideration like lighting, distance, and other forms of accessibility. If you work at a company that large then there\u2019s probably a good chance that there\u2019s a team to make those decisions for you through research (in which I guarantee you they don\u2019t conduct research on simulators) while you just type away at the code And that\u2019s fine and all but most people on here are starting out new. They should know there\u2019s more to app development then just plucking away at a keyboard. Being a developer is easy and writing efficient code is easy too. Making good product is hard Now if you own this billion dollar company or if you\u2019ve done the product research involving the UI you make and the UX you\u2019re told to implement then hey, maybe you\u2019re doing ok and my bad But if you\u2019re just following a requirements doc and trying to talk about how using a simulator is just as good as a device when it comes to all forms of accessibility then idk what to tell you. I mean I\u2019m not surprised you think that since you\u2019re only the maintainer...but if no one is helping you actually design the product then I hope it\u2019s a simple app And I\u2019m pretty sure Amazon is worth more than wherever you work and go look at how bad that app is right now. Go add something to your cart on your actual device and tell me how that could\u2019ve been avoided had they tested on an actual device. And if you see no problem with that...then I rest my case I\u2019m a dev and your credentials don\u2019t phase me in the slightest because I know what it takes to be a top dev. It doesn\u2019t take much. Most mobile devs don\u2019t understand anything when it comes to product. They just understand the framework they work in. If you want to humble brag about something then it\u2019s gonna take a lot more than that to impress me. Be the dev who knows the difference between the simulator and device when it comes to product design and not the dev trying to use his dev experience to justify one over the other. It\u2019s not a good look"}

But I found the mix of scroll-based and time-based animations a bit confusing at times. Sometimes I waited for an animation to finish because it felt like *something else* might still happen\u2026 and then nothing did. In other cases, animations only started after I\u2019d already scrolled past them. For example, the \u201cData stored on-device\u201d animation takes *waaay* too long just to reveal a fairly meaningless image. I was expecting some kind of insight or payoff, but it ended up feeling like wasted time. Same with the \u201cMeticulously refined interface a small gesture\u201d section. The zoom gesture looks super slick, but on my device, it just showed a black screen. I waited around 5 seconds thinking it would resolve into something and then nothing. More broadly, I often had to wait 3\u20135 seconds for UX animations before actually seeing the app screenshot you\u2019re trying to present. In my opinion, the animations are a bit overdone and sometimes get in the way of the product story, rather than enhancing it."}

SwiftUI basically abstracts from UiKit and gives you all these view classes that allows you to perform easier animations and easier lists. However to get more sophisticated you will end up writing extraneous amounts of code which would completely encapsulate the amount of code required if you were using UIKit. I\u2019ve been doing development for over 10 years it\u2019s as blatant as possible. SwiftUI is for Prototyping. Also most sophisticated animations majority of these things can be covered with SVGs. Big major companies use SVGs for animations not extraneous amounts of code. Don\u2019t get me wrong I think it\u2019s cool. But from what I\u2019m looking at other than a couple extra delegate methods, you can get the same exact implementation with much more control over your UI elements through UIKit."}

Visual Studio is an awful on all machines. It's not as much as a comparison thing, like finding anything better for certain development workflows is limiting, just like replacing Xcode isn't fully possible. So, Visual Studio is an awful program, as compared to other programs, not as compared to other IDEs - which is kinda hard to do, considering it has unique features designed for windows development. But generally, VS is slow, extremely slow, often unresponsive, crashes a lot, has a lot of broken and annoying things. People are used to slow and buggy things, so they just put up with it, but it's noticeable - at least to me. Considering editors performance-wise and stability, even standard windows notepad is better. Which is amazing considering notepad hasn't probably been seriously updated since windows vista or whatever. And argument is totally valid here, since when you open larger files something inside of VS crashes, and it becomes as useful as notepad. A standard installation of VIM is probably the best replacement for VS (not the funny integrated plugin, as the plugin doesn't work properly, and crashes partially as soon as you open VS). So VIM **without** plugins is probably superior in every aspect. The only problem with VIM is that people abuse the plugins and make IDE from what is essentially a simple editor. So yeah, for dotnet projects you can save a lot of time by using pure VIM and their command line tool. You loose sometime by doing things manually, but you gain a lot by having a fast, stable editor that you don't have to wait for."}

I've been using VS on and off for some of the specific things VS can do, and VS is the only program that has problems responding to my input in time. Take model editor for example (for editing entity framework models). It's sorta works, except when you click save and the whole VS freezes.. (which should be **unacceptable**, like wtf) - and look, Xcode implements something similar, and it's instant. > say Notepad is not stable Technically it isn't stable, since it has had some problems (especially with unicode) and it froze on me like a few times. > you're doing something wrong I've opened a few CSV files that are megs in size. But VS crashed with a rather large array of static data, I edited and pasted from ..VIM. So yeah, had to restart VS and never open that file again.. > Notepad++ blows VIM out of the water No. If we're talking about raw performance, VIM **without** plugins is much faster and stabler. Like, VIM can handle files gigs in size, while notepad++ has known problems with that. > If your claim is Visual Studio is not fast or stable then it's your machine. It's not my machine. I have a modern machine, and I've tested this on older machines and newer machines, it works about the same on all. You just put up with it and you don't notice it. Which is fine. But I hope you will realize, that your computer is fast enough to not have to wait around for it. > But, again, comparing Visual Studio to any other IDE -- it blows them all out of the water. I am not saying that other IDEs are better, again as I stated before, VS is a bad program, compared to other programs I use. Like, how bad do you have to be at your job, that doing something manually is faster than doing it though IDE. Not to mention the horror VS is for debugging, which comical, to the point even GDB's CLI beats it... > XCode is super flakey with even two monitors Xcode not XCode. And btw it's horrible in it's own ways, stability is probably the biggest problem it has, but at least it's not extremely slow. The new Xcode 12 is actually quite fast, not extremely fast, but still VS could take a page or two. > if it's not an IDE then why are you comparing it like it is an IDE? You're being dishonest here. Oh and btw, I'm not comparing it's IDE features. I am comparing qualities other programs have, so it's fine, as VS is a program."}

On September 20 last year, they started bringing in over $3,000 a day (90% of which was on iOS). The very next day, Apple removed all my apps from the App Store and blocked my account. I sent appeals, showed evidence, screenshots, and even sent a pre-trial claim, but was mostly ignored. Now I've filed a lawsuit against Apple, and for now, the iOS market is a no-go fpr me. I want to speak out, but I don\u2019t want to complain. Instead, I can share how simple ideas brought me good profits. Maybe someone will be interested and avoid making my mistakes. **First idea** The first app was super simple - you upload two before/after images and get a short video with a slide effect. [First version of the app]( My wife, who was a nail tech at the time, suggested the idea because she wanted to create content to attract clients. She couldn't find any apps for creating before/after videos in the App Store. I didn\u2019t believe her, we almost ended up arguing, and I went searching to prove her wrong. Turns out, she was right (as always). I persuaded a friend to help develop the app. It was 2019, we spent a couple of months developing it, and within a year, it was bringing in $100-200 a month. My friend thought the idea was unworkable, so I bought out his share for a token amount. This happened on February 26, 2020, right at my 30th birthday party. I sold a stake in a common startup and used part of the money to buy out my partner\u2019s share in the before/after app. I had about $10k in my pocket. The next day after the party, I sat down to redesign the app and think through new functionality. **First takeoff** I was lucky to quickly find a talented and affordable freelancer. We rebuilt the app almost from scratch in 1.5 months, costing me $2,000. What we did: * Redesign * New transitions, like diagonal ones * Ability to customize animation speed * Added effects settings: transition thickness, color, neon, etc. * Ability to add music * Ability to add text * Added support for stickers * Updated the store page: description, screenshots, icon * Localized the app for all available languages in the App Store [After update]( Before this update, the app gained a couple of hundred montly downloads in its first year. But a week after the new version was released, there was a surge in organics. Around the same time, I hired a marketing specialist for $400/month who launched the first ad. And boy, did it take off. We spent $200-300 on the first campaign, and within a month, I was maxing out my credit card to buy ads. All campaigns paid off. We used only one source, Apple Search Ads. Search Ads doesn't have extensive targeting options, so we didn't fully understand who our target users were. Then we were contacted by an influencer saying \u201clet\u2019s launch a dog grooming contest.\u201d It wasn\u2019t very clear who would be interested in that, but no problem, let\u2019s do it. As a prize, we gave away premium access to our app, just three promo codes. The return from the contest was phenomenal. It brought in $2,000 net, and I discovered a whole new world. A huge number of people are willing to invest any amount in their beloved doggos to brag about the results through our app. I was shocked that a simple idea like this one worked SO well. After the contest, we doubled for three more months in a row, and then reached a stable growth of 20-30% per month. [Screenshot from App Store Connect]( I still remember the moment I woke up, picked up my phone, and the app had earned a thousand dollars overnight for the first time. I was psyched, thanking the universe, the users, Apple, and the iPhone itself. Six months after the redesign, the app was bringing in about 200 times more than the original mark, $34k instead of $100-200 a month. $25k on iOS and $9k on Android (the Android version was made three months after the redesign). As a result, I started receiving offers to purchase the app. I refused until I heard, \u201cname the price.\u201d I don\u2019t know why, but I said $410k and after five days, I received that amount into my account. It seemed like an unimaginable amount of money to me; I couldn\u2019t believe what was happening. Only two years later did I realize the real value of the app at that time was at least $1 million. You know how it goes, do as I say, not as I do. To tell you more, the app\u2019s still alive and it\u2019s making good money without any updates. It paid for itself in 8 months and has been deep in the green ever since. I planned to continue making apps with this money, thinking I could expand. It\u2019s going to be smooth sailing from here on out, right? Absolutely not. **Landing** In 2021, my family and I moved to Chile, where we still live. We like it here, it's a beautiful country, pur children are growing up here, our daughter was born here, and we want to get Chilean passports. I sold everything back home - a car, an apartment, a plot of land, all my stuff. I started chasing my dream of making a serious video editing app. I thought, now I have money, I'll start figuring out a \"real\" app. Life is beautiful and amazing. I hired new devs and went to work for a year and a half. The first release turned out to be a failure: organic users never came, and the cost of attracting one user never fell below $10. Competing with the free CapCut was impossible. There were also parallel attempts to make other things. For example, an app for designing your Instagram feed. The first version of the app was growing great, but I thought with new features like collaboration and delayed auto-publishing, I'd find the key to success. However, reality was harsh. I spent six months just communicating with Facebook to gain access to the API methods I needed, only to find that Facebook kept changing things on the inside, making the app\u2019s features unusable. In the end, I didn\u2019t even earn $1,000. I spent almost all my money working tirelessly, but nothing ever took off. **Insights and the crash** Crisis makes you think. I realized my strength was in niche apps and decided to return to where I started: small apps covering specific needs without any unnecessary noise. I made the Boomerang app, regardless of the fact that Instagram already had this feature. But I made a separate app, and it started to grow. There was also an app filled with beautiful fonts for designing social media posts. An app for creating Reels. Once I realized my strengths, things started to look up again. I returned to the idea of collages. Every app began to make money. Whew! [Screenshot from my company website]( Overall, the account had six apps with an above 4.5 stars average App Store rating. On August 21, 2023, I received a notification from Apple that they had removed my app from the App Store and were going to shut down my account if I did not correct the violations within 30 days. Not any specific violations, just \u201cviolations.\u201d I sent Apple evidence, screenshots, and offered access to the source files, but I was either ignored completely pr got an auto-reply. I was sure this was just some kind of mistake and waited for an answer. We continued to make updates and worked on new features. On September 20, the apps earned more than $3,000 in 24 hours for the first time and were removed by Apple the next day. Payments were suspended, and I had $110,000 left in my account. I was stunned. The first appeal was rejected, the reasons for the blocking were unknown, and it was unclear what to do. I immediately submitted a second appeal. Eight weeks of silence and again a refusal. I lost everything I worked for in a single day.. I started a petition on [Change.org]( and shared my story in a [tweet]( that gained significant traction. Someone from Twitter published my story on [Hacker News]( it became #1, collecting more than 400 comments. I received hundreds of support messages in my dms, and only then did Apple finally send an explanation. According to them, my account was frozen \u201cfor association with a previously closed fraudulent account.\u201d Of course, I had no connection with fraudulent accounts, otherwise I wouldn\u2019t even be sharing the story in the first place. The only positive reaction to the hype was the return of $110,000. I started my little investigation. The \u201cfraudulent\u201d account may have turned out to be my old account, which once contained the first app for creating before/after videos. The very same thing that started it all. I continued to pay $99 for this account because it is dear to me, it\u2019s nostalgic and a part of my life. Just before it was closed, I tried to publish a card game based on the popular game Never Have I Ever on this account. This concept seemed ideal for me to master interface solutions when moving from Swift UIKit to Swift UI. But recently, other things have come to light. We found a company of former partners with an identical name to mine. Apparently, Apple connected me with this company that I didn't even know existed. But I can\u2019t know for sure because there is no feedback from the corporation. Any letters with any arguments and documents are ignored. I had to sue, but that\u2019s a whole other big story. Communication with Apple is gfar from being related to development; maybe I\u2019ll tell you about it someday. **What's next and what about other stores** 90% of our profits came through Apple. We're now fully focused on Android and have grown 4x in 8 months, but it's still not enough to cover all development costs. I don\u2019t make enough money to continue supporting the team. We're holding out for now because finding developers who understand graphics and video is difficult (by the way, a good niche for devs who are not sure what to try next). The growth on Android is also related to the market's quirks: the Android audience is many times larger than the number of iPhone users, but not every Android can render a new video from 12 frames. Back to my story. Next will be a trial, petitions, and pleas. I hope my experience will be useful to someone because I am not the first and, most likely, not the last to find myself in this situation. Corporations don't care about individual developers. Even if they are left with nothing. It might sound trivial, but don\u2019t put all your eggs in one basket. The larger the corporation, the less attention it will pay to you. With Apple, after blocking, you lose the opportunity to even talk to support on the phone. Text appeals only. In fact, I communicated with the answering machine for a whole month until I was blocked. At any moment, you can lose everything you have - your account, apps, users. With the snap of a finger, what you thought belonged to you will disappear. The only thing I realized is that only public discussion of the problem and the courts can somehow induce them to change their policy towards developers. In the meantime, I\u2019ll go get ready for the next update."}

I wish you all the best with your lawsuit. I am also selling an app on both Android and iOS platforms. Here are my conclusions about the two platforms: * iOS users are much more willing to purchase or subscribe to paid items. * iOS users are more likely to leave positive reviews, whereas Android users often leave negative reviews, expecting the app to be completely free. * Monetizing via ads is easier on iOS. Showing ads is resource-intensive, and on Android devices, it can slow down app performance. Therefore, I have had to suspend ads on Android for the moment. In short, iOS is a much more business-friendly environment, while Android can be more challenging. The only advantage of Android is that it is easier to gain installations. However, it is more difficult to monetize those installations. Do these findings align with your experiences? Thanks."}

As a Dev once thats done on a Friday night, at least you know the weekend is free to relax, as an iOS app dev you cannot even sleep well because your could still be rejected while your ass is on fire to replace an update that had bugs quickly. Of course, the company can blame QAs and Unit Tests for not catching every bug, but some bugs are extremely niche and specific to a small percentage of users, which could fall below 1%."}

There's a bit of a stand off between customers and devs... devs might need $1M to make a great product but the people aren't going to pay until the product is completed and proven... so it goes nowhere. This is why the game market, and app market in general, is all about a very, very small percentage of shops that make almost all the money. After it's been this way for a bit, other devs just get locked out because the barriers to entry are just too high and they can't compete. This is why the app store has millions of apps and almost nobody cares about any but a few hundred of them. Just like the web, you could remove 1/2 the web pages on the web and hardly nobody would even know. If I told you that 1/2 the apps on the app store were missing, how would you prove me wrong? They could ghost 1/2 of them and nobody would know the difference. It's just the way markets work as the tech ages. Mobile is over a decade old now."}

What you say is \"shit content\" others are willing to pay money for.

This is how they get a return on their investment of making a game that people clearly WANT to buy. Again, simple free market, the consumer has the choice, it's the consumer's money. This is just the way economics works. The big boys end up with a HUGE share of the money, they can use this to hire more devs and buy more marketings. We saw this with King's Candy Crush, they got a HUGE share of the market. This is just the way economics works, it's why Amazon has the growth it has and it's hard for people to compete against Amazon. People have the choice to shop Amazon, people have the choice to buy things on Candy Crush and Candy Crush has the choice what to do with that money in terms of marketing an better products."}

It was a weekly newspaper well known here in France. Samsung has always been quite difficult, and the approval form was easily 10 pages long. And every time, we had to write a whole bunch of stuff. In short, it was hell. We decided to stop working with them because, in the end, the downloads weren't great, and on two occasions, they blocked a publication for: Sharing articles. We were using native tools, so if it crashed, it was Samsung's fault... But the worst part was that we were running ads for Samsung. But the tester decided that Samsung was the only one allowed to run ads for... Samsung... In reality, we were a national newspaper, and Samsung was thrilled to run its ads with us. The tricky part was explaining this to the guy across the table without making him feel like he was losing face."}

But all donations, even lab time, have to send 30% to Apple, apparently. Then they complained about not understanding it (it's a freaking guide app for a university's labs, you munks, who doesn't get it?) And then they wanted a video of me using it on a real device, with explanations. And after that, they complained again about the white screen. I gave up, and now everyone of the 1200 students uses the TestFlight link."}

But you're very wrong about there being \"no reason\". We are building on top of APIs that require system-level frameworks to be installed and available on users' devices that actually perform the work we ask of them. Apple makes the strategic choice to always develop new functionality on a branch targeting the next version because they often require large, coordinated changes across multiple frameworks and services, and it would take significant extra effort to backport those changes to already-released, stable OS versions. Like I said, I wish there was a healthier balance, but it's not nearly as diabolical as the implications in your post. My understanding is that they were hoping to implement async/await simply as compiler syntactic sugar, which would have allowed it to be backwards-compatible. However, there were some changes required to the Dispatch framework in order to make async/await work the way they wanted it to. I think Apple is trying to work around those, but couldn't guarantee that effort's success by WWDC so as of right now it is iOS 15 only."}

Concurrency relies on runtime features and has tight OS integration but with trade-offs Apple could backport it like they explained on the forums.

SwiftUI on the other hand is a framework that\u2019s bundled with the OS and has dependencies on various other system frameworks. Backdeploying SwiftUI means you\u2019d have to include things like UIKit and anything else SwiftUI depends on. That would make your binary HUGE, probably several hundred Mb. And you wouldn\u2019t \u201cbenefit\u201d from free bug fixes when Apple does bug fixes like you do now because frameworks like SwiftUI aren\u2019t bundled into your app and you always load the version that\u2019s on the system.

I am sure the developers are doing their best but this can't keep on like this... First there was the time where they completely broke intellisense, instead of suggesting the function I just wrote, it would suggest some wild never used C constant from who knows where. Then they broke the debugger, oh you want to print this completely normal and regular variable? Well fuck you it's not in memory anymore b\\*\\*\\*! Now Xcode is so fucking slow I am literally considering switching careers instead of switching tabs, I work on a large scale project with a a moderate amount of modularization and really not that many packages. But holy molly how is it possible that Xcode is THIS slow, I have to wait like 10 fucking seconds to switching between pages, 10 seconds! That's like a minute lost for every 6 pages I got to switch between... Searches, don't get me started on searching, why do I have to click on \"find caller hierarchy\" like 3 times for Xcode to understand that it should indeed find the damn hierarchy instead of sitting there idly starring back at me. Searching is so bad in fact, that most of the time I prefer to search for TEXTS in the code like some medieval peasant programmer. I mean common Apple, the richest company in the galaxy can't make a better IDE than this? Are we going to sit on the side lines and watch ANDROID developers have better IDEs than us?? Edit: A few more points, stuff breaks constantly, our project has random SwiftUI lines that suddenly started throwing EXEC\\_BAD\\_ACCESS errors. Previews? Don't even bother with them, they never work, and if they do they break and crash constantly. There are constant differing functionalities between simulators and real devices, some bugs occur on devices, and not simulators, others vise versa, why?"}

Swift Package Manager is the one that really kills me. It's near perfect in terms of design, but Xcode's implementation seems to use the main thread for everything and causes the application to lock up all the time. Plus, Xcode loves to crash when doing anything with git. Also, feature-wise, I really hope this is the year we get some kind of Copilot like assistant. And if Apple don't want to build it themselves (though, by all accounts, they are going to), they should open up a new kind of extension for Xcode so that GitHub can do it."}

To say I was upset is an understatement. It had drawbacks like not being able to edit xibs, SwiftUI, basically no support for UI stuff. But for everything else, it was great. Now I'm back to hating on Xcode again. Apple's biggest mistake other than neglect is they don't allow developers to create real plugins, that can interact with all parts of Xcode. That's probably because of the first one. Neglect. Xcode has barely changed in many many years, it just get's more complicated, slower, and crashier. If there were any other competing tools, Xcode would barely exist; it would be the Notepad of IDEs on Apple's platform. A total pile of cow manure."}

There are definitely some downsides, but one of the definitive upsides is you get to use VS Code or JetBrains, which are both awesome, and only occasionally have to open up xcode. Aside from needing to have it open to run on device, in three years I've spent maybe 2-3 days total dealing with it. The downside is also the upside. When you are on a team you almost never have to open XCode or Android studio. So it takes a really long time to understand what's going on under the hood when it's your turn to do configuration/devops/deployment type tasks. After 3 years, I would say most things it would probably take you 15 seconds to do, it takes me an hour or two. It's easily the most confusing IDE I've ever worked with. Android Studio is weird too, but less weird, and anything I have to do on the iOS side always takes a fraction of the time on Android and doesn't require opening it up. Call me crazy, but it feels like there's some evil force at Apple that feeds off the pain people feel when something is made harder than it has to be. Like the Energy Vampire from \"What We Do in the Shadows\". Android is the opposite, basically what you would expect from the Google. I've wanted to start learning how to write Android services in Kotlin almost since I started with react native."}

Simulators are good, but only so far because not all things can *actually* be tested. Due to simulator limitations I have to test on devices, which is slow as hell, especially on Apple Watch. Losing connection, slow debugging and getting info. Appaling lack of good developer documentation and \u00abgood practices\u00bb about what *to do* and *avoid* makes projects and builds a PITA. Yes there are videos etc. but ffs have a reference guide also! Videoes are slow and you are looking for a needle in a haystack. Then the last part of Apple being Apple as a company, which I am respecting less and less for each year. The developer experience is so incredibly important and there is good reason why people, especially in Norway, aren\u2019t going for it. There are a few outliers, but no one even cared about anything Apple when I went to university a few years ago, it\u2019s too restrictive and no one cares.

I've encountered tons of false positives and false negatives with these features. You just need to know how to use plain text search to find all possible references to things. * Autocomplete is a complete joke. It can take multiple seconds of waiting for any suggestion to show up and the suggestions are often invalid. Most common of all, autocomplete fails to do anything and you have to completely finish the statement and wait for the IDE to catch up before you find out if it's valid or not. * Errors shown in the editor are extremely unreliable. They frequently show up while editing, disappear when building (the build is successful, meaning there was actually no error), then reappear when you resume editing * Error messages are often cryptic. Swift will often give vague \"can't type check this\" errors that you just have to know how to fix. Objective-C will give misleading errors that seem specific but the root cause is completely different from what they say. Most automatic suggestions to fix errors actually just suppress/ignore the error, which is a really bad idea * The plugin system is all but useless and the plugin ecosystem is practically dead because they are so limited. Apple killed the really good community Vim plugin and replaced it with a built-in Vim mode that feels like it was made by an intern who has only used Vim for 15 minutes. Half of Vim's features don't work at all, the other half barely work and have glaring bugs that will horribly mangle your source code by inserting text in the wrong place, moving the cursor in unpredictable ways, etc. I can't remember the last time an Xcode release actually fixed a bug I noticed. Every release invariably introduces more bugs and make the whole UI and build process even slower. I also work on a comparably complex Android app in Android Studio and while it also has its flaws, none are so glaring and obvious as these. I have trained multiple software engineers on how to develop enterprise apps in Xcode and they are all shocked at how clumsy and unergonomic Xcode is to use compared to others."}

You *want* Xcode to be good. I don\u2019t blame you for that. We all do. Give it a couple of days. Pick one. Random errors for no reason? We got those! You would expect the IDE to clean itself. For example between updates. Not in Xcode. If you have old simulators they\u2019ll just eat up dozens of gigs of your disk until you remove them manually. \u201cAh but that is surely one click of a button away\u201d. Yeah sure. Good luck finding where they put that setting if you\u2019ve never been there before. Oh oh how about trying to use the simulator with an app that requires microphone recording? Surprise! The set of supported codecs and rates is not the same for physical devices than for simulators! How about using AVAudio engine to process the audio? Great great except\u2026 a bunch of the API is not even supported in the simulators either! And even if it is supported in the physical devices and you make a mistake you will get cryptic errors that mean nothing! But hey maybe the new stuff is better right? Like making a standalone app for Apple Watch. This stuff is relatively new, they couldn\u2019t possibly mess that up too right? RIGHT? Well then explain to me why do you need to create a mock iOS target on the side of an Apple Watch target for a *standalone* app. This is fun. How about when running the app on a physical device, nothing can go wrong huh. Yeah ok. So sometimes the Apple Watch decides it does not want to talk to Xcode anymore and you need to restart Xcode, the Mac OS and the Apple Watch for them to be happy again and talk between each other again. Last time I wrote an app in Xcode I spent 1/3 of my time worrying that Xcode wouldn\u2019t compile, 1/3 of my time debugging the simulator and 1/3 writing the code. Xcode is was and seemingly will always be a half cooked IDE that focuses on new features instead of fixing all that is wrong with it. But, I mean, in line with all the Apple dev environment.

This is just one example amongst many and Vim mode is still not free of trivial bugs. But I agree, today Xcode is actually not bad and a lot of these bugs have been fixed. We came a long long way\u2026 Also, the inability to add plugins can sometimes be very annoying. I would have loved to be able to use Xvim for example which used to manage Vim motions much better. Apple not only made it extremely hard and bug prone to have Xvim installed, but moving to Xcode 13 they simply killed it. I barely use any plugin on other IDEs (no more than 5 usually), but when you need one it\u2019s so convenient to just \u201cplug a new feature in\u201d and use it with NO BUGS. Also, I cannot believe that in 2024 Xcode still doesn\u2019t have relative line numbers. If they were more open and had a plug-in market, this issue would have been solved a long while ago. Lastly, Xcode can be slow and annoying still. Sometimes it will warn you about something or make up a random error that doesn\u2019t exist. It happens in other IDEs alright but not as often as in Xcode. It is also slower than your average IDE and I am confident this is mostly due to Apple\u2019s tendency to favour on almost all their software memory efficiency and battery performance over speed."}

The main thing I like about Xcode and before that Metrowerks and THINK C was search. Like Command E to define search string. So if I have BlahBlahBlah 7 times in my source and I want to change 4 of them to BlehBlehBleh, I can doubleclick on BlahBlahBlah, press Command E, type BlehBlehBleh, double click on that, press Command C to copy that, press Command G to find next occurrence and then based on some criteria, skip it or press Command V to change BlahBlahBlah to BlehBlehBleh.

You don't get suggestions almost at all when you work cross-package, you don't get click-throughs to type definitions, loading the project takes a minute or two (on M1, M3 Pros) with a lot of loading balls in the meantime. When you use SPM, make a file in a package and it needs to resolve those 50+ dependencies again, you wait another minute with lag... Of course we optimize as much as we can and due to the architecture, the previews work and need to build only 1-5 packages, so working with that is quick, but it's A LOT worse than Android Studio of our Android counterparts working on the same app."}

What really irks me though is that there\u2019s just so much stuff you have to do with a mouse. Some stuff you can\u2019t even put a shortcut key for. The location of the UI controls sometimes just doesn\u2019t make sense.

I recommend taking a stroll through the key bindings in general, there's actually a lot of useful commands. I can't live without \"Find selected symbol in workspace\" which I assigned to Cmd+E so I can just put my cursor on a symbol and press the shortcut. It works as a fine replacement of the utterly broken \"Find callers\", and unlike Cmd+Shift+F it actually distinguishes between members of different classes/structs with identical names.

This most recent EdgeToEdge update for Android 15 and the \u201cfixes\u201d to make it work correctly are some of the worst engineering I have ever seen.

As others have said - if you could compile for iOS in literally anything else, you'd be sad at how bad Xcode is. Sad as in - it's obvious Apple doesn't put forth effort. I'm sorry you had to go through VB.Net instead of CSharp though. That couldn't have been fun. Although back in the late 90's - I used vb5 and vb6 because it made making programs practically trivial. Then CSharp came out and I never looked back at VB again. I actively avoid VBS too if I can. Although .Net has progressed amazingly well since .Net core. > Then I meddled with PHP for some time using Sublime Text. I don't know anyone who considers Sublime an IDE. Although in the timeframe you're in - I can't tell if that was when PHP was dog shit or if they had pulled their head from their ass by then - I hear it's way less dog shit now than it used to be and is a respectable language now. To be fair - I have a personal dislike for interpreted language (as opposed to compiled languages). > And as a amateur my experience with Xcode was genuinely good. Consider yourself fortunate. I genuinely wish Apple would open things up so we could use other IDE's to write and compile in. It's sad they nerfed the previewer to be *worse* than it was though - back when you could see multiple previews at once was handy. Assuming they actually worked.

It would balance it a little bit better to either increase the stroke for the inner icon (I am not sure how that would play out with the particular choice of the down arrow) with the rest. Vertically matching the waves inside (water) with the infill of the circle might increase the aesthetics of it as well.

Even i would make more money outside of app store. But apple has always been a for-profit company which has been able to establish a solid customer base who spend on apps and stuffs. Why should a company allow some developers to have access to this customer base and not earn a good amount of profit? One can argue that developer makes apps and that's why their phone is popular. But it goes the other way too, like they make phones, have good customer base so we make apps. Every business is trying to maximize its profit. Epic, Basecamp, Apple all are doing the same thing. If i were running a business, i would do the same thing. I don't think basecamp will lower its pricing to 10$ a month or even 50$ from its current 99$ if apple lowers the price on their ends. For me i don't have problem with how much they charge for now. Because the value that i perceive currently with that charge, i think it justifies for me. For some people or company, it might not be justifiable. Maybe in the future, it won't be for me too.But i don't believe a bit that basecamp cto or epic or spotify is fighting for us developer and all.

However, there are sites that do very well without getting a ton of traffic. Much like YouTube and podcasts. You have the top X% that probably make the same as all the rest combined. The sad thing is that people come into app dev, YouTube, podcasting, etc... and they think they have a great chance. I've seen some great YouTube content that never got over 300 views. Two things about app dev: 1. there's a very small percentage of people that actually buy much 2. most people have a handful of apps that account for most of their use What's left over is for us to fight over and it seems like the most money per user is on iOS by a big margin.

It's been known for a long time that most apps don't break even, that doesn't mean money can't be made, but you have to remember there's over 2 million apps on Apple's App Store, and even more on Android. You can hit a home run, but the odds are against it. It's like buying a lotto ticket, except you pay more, it takes more time, but the odds are pretty poor that you'll hit a home run. Not only that, but the vultures that knock off your app are there ready to clone what you've done. IIRC, tiny towers was cloned by some company, maybe Zynga. Zynga was well known for stealing apps.

Since it\u2019s very niche, I don\u2019t expect explosive growth, but I\u2019d like to start receiving at least some revenue to cover development and maintenance costs. I\u2019ve already prepared a few things: * **Grandfathering system** \u2192 current users won\u2019t lose access to features they\u2019ve already been using when subscriptions go live. * **Trials** \u2192 3-day free trial for monthly plans, 1-week for annual. I also want to be transparent: I know my app is far from perfect. I\u2019ve spent almost 8 months working on it to get it into a stable state where the \u201cpro\u201d features feel worth charging for, but I also know it will never be completely bug-free or flawless. That bothers me and honestly makes me hesitate to implement subscriptions, because I keep thinking my app isn\u2019t \u201cgood enough\u201d to charge for. Has anyone else felt this way? Does this line of thinking even make sense?

This is my first app, so I\u2019m a bit lost. Any insight would be greatly appreciated. Thanks, and I hope you all have a great weekend! **TL;DR:** First-time iOS dev here. Built a niche, feature-rich app (tracking, stats, backups, logs). It\u2019s free now but I want to move to subscriptions with trials + grandfathering. I know it\u2019s not perfect and never will be bug-free, which makes me doubt if it\u2019s \u201cgood enough\u201d to charge for.

In my case, when I switched to subscriptions, I put only new features behind the subscription, all features that were once part of the app when it was a one-time purchase I made available for free. About finding the right price: one thing you could do is start low, and increase as you add features, and monitor subscription signup rates. You can allow people who subscribed at the low initial price to stay on that price even if you up prices for new subscribers (that's what I did). So my early users are rewarded with exceptionally low prices. Hope that helps!"}

For example, for annual subscriptions I have: - $24.99 (2 week free trial) - $19.99 for the first year then $24.99 - $19.99 (2 week free trial) - $14.99 (No free trial) Then I will create a paywall and setup an A/B tests with two of the offerings above. I normally let a test run for 4 weeks so you can see the conversion rates from the free trials. I\u2019ve actually found that having the price set to $19.99 when compared to $24.99 didn\u2019t make a noticeable difference so I kept the price at $24.99. I then run a separate A/B test on people who have had the 2 week free trial and cancelled. I will offer them the $19.99 or $14.99 offer to see if I can regain their subscription. I also AB test that packages to show them. For example I noticed that offering the Monthly option next to the Yearly option actually made less people sign up for the yearly, so I ended up just promoting the yearly and had the monthly option hidden in an \u201cAll Plans\u201d tab. So I\u2019d say experiment with that you present people not just the price. It\u2019s quite interesting. I currently use Superwall for my paywalls and would highly recommend it. That or RevenueCat paywalls. Happy to answer any other questions."}

My app is a gardening app I built solo. It stores all data locally and uses free or flat-rate services, so my costs stay low and don\u2019t increase as more people use it. The idea is to compete with other apps by offering the same (or better) features for free, while slowly growing market share. The only monetization is a completely optional subscription. After you\u2019ve done a lot in the app, you\u2019ll see a single prompt asking if you\u2019d like to support development. If you say no, you\u2019ll never see it again\u2014just a button at the top of the settings if you ever change your mind. At some point I will likely add the ability to make a one time support payment. What do you think of this approach? I don\u2019t expect it to convert at the rates that bigger apps are getting, but with low/no costs, I think I can undercut the likes of Planta to steal some market.

But the money was never taken from the company cc and every expiry date the renewal date keeps moving forward a month. Its now been moved to Sep 2025.

We have the money :)"}

For users a centralised space to manage app payments, subscriptions and refunds and read user reviews, and to know an app has been vetted. This wouldn\u2019t be possible with web apps. Having Apple as payment intermediary guarantees a certain level of security for users to get refunds and not be scammed and not install malicious software. For developers it gives your app visibility to all iOS users, opening up an entirely new distribution channel outside of www. To me it would have been a perfect situation if PWAs weren\u2019t as crippled as they are. Being forced to use the App Store and not hustle on your own via www apps is a pity and the argument for the store would be stronger if you at least had the choice to go your own way. But at the end of the day you\u2019re still free to not make apps for this platform. But we all know Apple users pay more for apps than any other demographic."}

I\u2019ve been coding since 2013, starting out with PHP and eventually moving into full-stack JavaScript with React and NodeJS. These days, my favorite tool is NextJS because it lets me build full-stack apps efficiently. For years, I wanted to create iOS apps, but every time I tried to learn native development, I just couldn\u2019t find enough time\u2014my web projects always took priority. The technical details felt overwhelming, and honestly, the lack of knowledge held me back. But things changed when AI coding tools entered the scene. Now, I don\u2019t need to master every single technical aspect. Instead, I can focus on my ideas and bring them to life, letting AI handle the heavy lifting. It\u2019s a game-changer\u2014something I never thought I\u2019d be able to do. Another big reason for diving into iOS was inspiration from indie developers like Adam Lyttle and Aivars Meijers. Watching them build cool stuff and genuinely enjoy the process made me want to try it myself. Plus, reaching potential customers seems easier with mobile apps than with web apps (at least in my experience). And since I live in T\u00fcrkiye (aka Turkey), integrating payment gateways like Stripe or PayPal for web apps is a pain\u2014they\u2019re not available here. With mobile apps, I don\u2019t have to worry about that. Is there any web developer that builds mobile apps like me? Would love to hear your stories or tips in the comments!"}

The online systems are much better, especially GitHub Copilot, but I would rather have a local LLM that can handle 90% of the work I need and jump over to an online one as a last resort.

One hacky way to add optional members to a Swift protocol is to extend the protocol and provide a default implementation but that often doesn\u2019t make sense (what if that method has a return value) and you can\u2019t check if you are calling the default implementation or a user-provided one. Alternatively, you can mark a protocol Objective-C compatible and mark a member as optional, but then all your enums in the protocol must be Objective-C compatible too (by using integers as their raw value) and your structs must be refactored into classes, and so must *everything* that relies on all that code. Optionals for nullable values are colors for values too. The Swift compiler has no way of knowing all the symbols in SF Symbols or the images in the app bundle, so every API that takes in a UIImage must actually take in an optional UIImage, because the caller may have used an incorrect symbol name or image resource name. This language is way too complicated and messy."}
