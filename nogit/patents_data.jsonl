As a member of the patent board for several years, while the law authorized a board to grant or refuse patents, I saw with what slow progress a system of general rules could be matured. It's indeed out of need to sort the wheat from the chaff that the requirement that an invention be not only novel, but also **not obvious**, would ultimately develop, first in case law, and only much later in statute. Mind you, Jefferson's assertion that, in 1813, of all times, \"the nations which refuse monopolies of invention, are as fruitful as England in new and useful devices\", was rather disingenuous : at that very time, the fledgling Industrial Revolution, which was intimately linked to Britain's patent system (see e.g. James Watt's use of the patent system) was giving Britain a distinct technological lead over other nations, which had motivated not only the nascent US, but also revolutionary France to adopt similar patent systems..."}

As you rightfully point out Windows innovation has been faster than Linux leading to wider adoption hence broader benefits. Just because Linux is open source doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s had broader benefits (1.5% of OS market share). Windows is also not a single patent innovation its a conglomerate of innovations packaged together. Just because crowdstrike messed up and caused a global outage for a few hours doesn\u2019t mean that Windows patents are to blame.

The first point is that most, or at least many, early patents from before 1836 were lost in a fire, and the patent numbering system restarted. Thus, US patent #1 is from 1836 and is John Ruggles' improvement to trains. ( The second point is that some of Jefferson's purported history about patents is incorrect. In full context, we have the tremendous luxury of the Internet today which makes historical research infinitely easier than it was in Jefferson's day. The Republic of Venice/St. Mark was the first country to develop a full-fledged patent system. In Europe and the Middle East/North Africa, early proto-patent rights for inventors appear go back to Antiquity in limited ways with the law sometimes favoring inventors for releasing inventions. Outright \"Monopolies of Invention\" appear to have begun in the Late Roman Empire during the reigns of Diocletian and Constantine. However, these monopolies were not necessarily given to the actual and recognized inventors of the monopolilzed technology, but rather were given to people who could reverse engineer products whose mechanisms were kept secret or simply as a reward to military generals. This system actually worked reasonably well for getting people to disclose relatively mild innovations such as ship-mills, but failed miserably to get people to disclose exceptional innovations such as the Lycurgus Cup, whose mechanism of action was essentially a mystery for millennia. When the Western Roman Empire fell, and the Eastern Roman/Byzantine Empire would reconquer much of it in the 6th Century, tensions would arise between Italy and the occupying Byzantines. Some of these tensions related to the Byzantines granting monopolies over certain methods of making silk to individuals who had nothing to do with inventing those methods but merely got them from China, either by theft or consent. As Venice began to break with the Byzantine Empire and grow in power, it developed more and more laws granting inventors particular privileges over inventions in reaction to the Byzantine/Late-Roman system. This culminated in the Venetian Patent Statute of 1474, which is the first regular Patent Law, and curiously only a couple of decades after the Byzantine Empire fell. In India, \"Monopolies of Invention\" were given by 600 AD in Gurjaradesa, but these were not necessarily for inventors. Also, this was not too popular and later Indian kingdoms generally abandoned the practice. In Dynastic China, the state commonly rewarded inventors for disclosing inventions with government contracts."}

Not to mention, many inventions are quite obvious and would be impossible to maintain as a trade secret. Ideally, the patent system is supposed to reward innovation in exchange for public disclosure. In practice it\u2019s not an ideal system, but for an individual inventor like myself, getting a patent could change my life if I could successfully license or implement my invention (I\u2019m about to start the application process). Still, the whole patent process is quite expensive and out-of-reach for many individual inventors. To my understanding (IANAL), the system was originally conceived for individual inventors, but the ownership of most patents goes to large corporations and universities these days, as that\u2019s where most research, development, and innovation happens. That makes me think that the patent system is not built around how it is actually used in practice. Even so, there persist creative and divergent thinkers who are innovating and inventing as individuals (or in small groups outside of any workplace), including myself. Our needs are just as important as the needs of corporate and academic innovators and inventors; some individual inventors end up launching businesses and creating jobs."}

This is actually in your best interest. Applying for a patent is an adversarial process much like a trial between the person applying for the patent and the patent office. the person applying for the patent basically is saying I have a unique idea. the patent office as part of its job will respond based on the prior art and make the argument that you do not have a unique idea and thus the battle is joined. This is where a lot of inventors think that the patent office is not on their side but against them when in actuality the opposite is true. you want the patent office to object to your patent and you want them to make you prove why it's better than the prior art. they are actually doing their job and you want them to do this because in the end it will result in a stronger patent. if you apply for a patent with some feeble arguments and weak claims in your patent and it issues you might think great but infringers might realize you have a weak patent and try and take advantage of it and this is not what you want. If you were in the service would you rather have a drill sergeant that kicked your ass every chance he got, made you run till your feet bleed and took every advantage and dirty trick he could think of during training? or would you want a drill sergeant that basically takes you out to dinner every night and tells you what a great job you are doing. if my next stop was a war, I would much rather have the former than the latter as I would be more prepared with a greater chance of survival."}

I'm senior (mostly telco and datacom) expert/leader who has been around 30 patents with a lot experience reading patents and legal stuff. Coming originally from SW background helps a lot in this type of stuff and effectively both have all kinds of structures and a language is used for describing rules/claims. I had a break between jobs and wanted to work on a novel idea that I decided to patent as I know this stuff. Oh boy was I wrong. I did a lot of reading on patenting and like said I have reviewed a lot of patents on my own and somebody else's patent applications but making actual patent application on my own turned to be nasty even through I had a patent lawyer helping me a bit with the claims. As I didn't get funding for my idea and after a couple sessions with USPTO (as they started to give hard time as they always do for any application), I realized that my claims architecture was f'ed up (major rework was needed) so I decided to cut my loses and leave to that. The mistakes superficially where not that bad but as in many cases, if the base architecture was wrong, it is really hard to avoid making a complete rewrite. If I were start to do that again, I would use an agency as there are many little things that one needs to get right that doesn't pop up from the old applications and books. Yes, agencies cost money but so does applications that don't work or you spend 100 hours on them. I don't think that making patent on your own is a rocket science but doing one well must become like a hobby to you where you are not looking to actually save money (if you value your own time at all) and you are willing to spend a lot of time with it (including making few mistakes on your way that might invalidate your ideas). Provisional doesn't really mean that much but then again it is bases for the actual application patent so you want to ask yourself, how serious are you with the idea and what do you want to accomplish by filing provisional. Most big corporates buy an extra year with filing provisional but if as individual inventor want to make something out of it, you might as well in the most cases make the full application. So if you as inventor like to just go through the process of making provisional, it can kind of be a fun hobby if you are into that sort of things but if you are serious about your idea, just get somebody to do it for you. Most likely you are inventor because you are good at that. There are other experts to whom you want to outsource stuff like making the patent."}

I would certainly consider a patent draft to be much more difficult now than when I first started drafting and wasn't even aware of the basic mistakes I was making. I guess that's the same in any skilled profession: there's a watershed when you finally have sufficient experience to first appreciate how little experience you really have! But I think your experience is actually fairly unusual - at least as far as you hear people sharing. More typically inventors either assume they did a great job but the prior art was too close, or are *convinced* they did a great job because they got a granted patent. You don't need to look very hard to find plenty online who actively recommend that other inventors do their own patent drafting based on their experience preparing a small number of their own patents which have never been assessed by someone who knows what they're doing. It's very rare to find someone who can recognise that a lack of experience at the drafting stage created problems that they encountered later on, and would be reluctant to go it alone a second time. That's what makes your advice here so useful."}

The frequency of lay questions has increased recently and some of them have been very low-effort posts essentially asking for a primer on patents. I don't think those particular posts contribute much to the sub and my personal view as a participant is that it should be primarily a discussion of patent law as opposed to a free clinic. However, that's not true of all inventor questions and some of the threads have ended up being interesting. The previous mod split inventor questions off into a separate sub that is currently inactive (r/ipadvice). There was some discussion with other patent-related subs when this was formed, and a general uneasiness about liability. Another split along these lines might be the answer, and if there was a general consensus that inventor questions should be directed to a new sub then I think it would be appropriate to exclude them here. But I that would need to be a collective decision and someone (not me) would need to volunteer for the inevitably thankless task of moderating it. My feeling at the moment is that there's no compulsion to participate in inventor-question threads, so perhaps the real issue is how provide users who don't want to see them with a way of accessing just the professional posts. It won't help with inclusion in the front page, but a separate flair for professional/inventor posts could provide an answer to filtering posts within the sub. How to do that and also continue to differentiate based on jurisdiction is a problem, however. Another option I've considered is having a weekly sticky thread for inventor questions. That would help with your front page irritation, but it would also hide the inventor questions from those who do enjoy participating in them (and there has been plenty of participation so I think that shouldn't be overlooked). Again, it's no magic bullet. It's possible that we're just experiencing a temporary surge in questions (and notably also answers) posted by non-professionals. The discussion has been a bit spicier than normal too and that's not unrelated. I'm inclined to say we give it a bit longer to see how things develop and then I'll pose the question again and see if feelings have changed. I'd note, however, that when the sub prohibited advice posts it also permitted links to blogs and decent content was hidden amongst vast numbers of those. Most of the blog links were actually posted by the moderator at the time - I suspect because of a dirth of other content in the absence of questions from inventors. There's a balance to be struck: high-quality professional content is great and no one wants to see pointless rubbish, but eliminating all the 'filler' between those extremes risks creating a ghost sub where few ever notice the infrequent posts. I'm not sure we have that critical mass of professional content, and inventor questions do keep the discussion active."}

He decided that he'd be happy for us to file an application on the basis that he didn't plan to do anything with it himself and quite fancied the CV material and financial reward from the company so I had to contact the university to check who actually owned the invention. This was a world-famous institution with *massive* research funding, etc. However, not only did they barely have anyone handling their IP, but they thought I was crazy when I asked if there was an IP ownership agreement for their students and were happy to confirm they had no rights to the invention. They literally couldn't have been less interested. But you're completely right that science and engineering courses should provide an IP element. It's actually something that I've proposed to my company - a sort of outreach arrangement where we provide patent attorneys to give a lecture at departments relevant to our tech area.

In effect both student and the schools have an incentive to seek licensing deals, and schools provide legitimacy along with the actual financial means to bring suit against large companies that normally wouldn't give small inventors the time of day. if the universities have an associated law school, it can be even more cost effective, as students could intern or get credit for assisting in the process (overlooked by a registered attorney).

It is not a legal advice sub, although you are welcome to post questions here. # [WE HAVE AN FAQ]( Seriously, please read the FAQ before you post. It isn't long and contains the answer to a lot of the questions posted here. Many other questions will have been asked and answered previously and can be answered much more quickly by searching the sub than by asking them again. &#x200B; Also, the following warnings are important: &#x200B; **WARNING 1 - ATTORNEY-CLIENT RELATIONSHIPS** It is important to understand that whilst *some* of the users here are legal professionals they are not *your* legal professionals. Any responses you receive are not \"legal advice\" and they are not provided as part of an attorney-client relationship. You are welcome to ask questions about patents, but you mustn't take real world decisions based on the answers you receive. Instead, for advice you can rely on you need to hire a professional (i.e. a patent agent/attorney) to advise based on the full facts of your situation and under appropriate professional insurance. &#x200B; **WARNING 2 - SHARING DETAILS OF YOUR INVENTIONS** If you are an inventor then remember that disclosing details of your invention before filing a patent application can preclude you from doing so. This is important: **the act of sharing details here can make it impossible for you to patent your invention.** Even sharing the contents of an unpublished patent application can limit your future options. Therefore, it is imperative that you do not disclose information about your invention on this sub (or anywhere else) prior to consulting a professional for advice. &#x200B; **WARNING 3 - PATENT LAW IS COUNTRY-SPECIFIC** Each country has its own laws relating to patents, which is why it's important to specify location in your posts (preferably by selecting the appropriate flair). This is especially important if you are asking a question, because the correct answer will often depend on which country's laws apply. Similarly, when looking at previous threads bear in mind the country that is being discussed. &#x200B; **WARNING 4 - SEEKING REPRESENTATION HERE** Some of the users here are professionals, some are not. An anonymous forum is not an appropriate place to seek a patent agent/attorney or other form of professional representation. It is explicitly against our rules for attorneys to seek new clients here, or for you to approach users you think are attorneys to try and hire them. These rules are in place to protect *you*, so please don't try to circumvent them. [The FAQ]( contains advice on finding a patent attorney."}
