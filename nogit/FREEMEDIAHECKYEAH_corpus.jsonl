These fragile, obsolete discs hold some of the earliest recordings of a vanishing American culture. But this lawsuit goes far beyond old records. It’s an attack on the Internet Archive itself. This lawsuit is an **existential threat** to the Internet Archive and everything we preserve—including the **Wayback Machine**, a cornerstone of memory and preservation on the internet. **At a time when digital information is disappearing, being rewritten, or erased entirely, the tools to preserve history must be defended—not dismantled.** This isn’t just about music. It’s about whether future generations will have access to knowledge, history, and culture. *** ## [Sign our open letter]( and tell the record labels to drop their lawsuit. *** **Posted by Chris Freeland, Director of Library Services at Internet Archive** ###### Source:"}
