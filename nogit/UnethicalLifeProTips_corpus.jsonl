After that I wrote it in my resume like it was a job and bam significant increase in the number of interview call backs. It's a perfect lie, no one can verify it, they can't ask you details about it without being a dick, you can be as vague as you want and no one will press you, and it makes you look like a goddamn selfless hero. Edit: My biggest post on reddit is encouraging people to lie about dying relatives, I worry about what this says about me. Edit2: So this blew up and I've seen a lot of comments questioning the importance of wage gaps so I'm going to use this little spot light I have to give some unsolicited advice from a managers standpoint. I work in management and I do a lot of hiring so I want to say in no uncertain terms that unexplained employment gaps do raise red flags, I get enough resumes on my desk that I have to narrow down real quick and employment gaps are an easy category to thin out my stack. That being said there are a lot of good reasons for employment gaps if you have one don't be afraid to put it in your resume if you learned something or gained some valuable experience or insight. You might have something that I can't get from Greg who worked accounting for 20 strait years. If you traveled for a year after college summarize what skills you acquired; you can adapt to new environments easily, you work well with a diverse team, etc. If you provided end of life care you learned a lot of responsibility you deal with stress and difficult conditions well. If you spent your 2 years unemployed sniffing glue in your moms basement I can't help you besides telling you to lie but as a manager I just want to know that you did something valuable with your time. In fewer words don't leave your employment gap up to my imagination I'm cynical enough to fill it in with glue sniffing or prison. Also just to answer this line of inquiry that I have seen definitely leave rehab out I have 3 other people just as qualified as you sitting on my desk that didn't just tell me that they (used to) have an impulse control problem. I love second chances and all that but my job performance is partially determined by the quality of the team I hire, risks no matter how noble aren't in my best interest."}

I get it's a joke, but people take it as an actual, educational joke like it's a man yelling at the sea, and that's just wrong. Furthermore, these things have an actual impact on discussions about conservation efforts---If every time Koalas get brought up, someone posts this copypasta, that means it's seriously shaping public opinion about the animal and their supposed lack of importance. >Speaking of stupidity and food, one of the likely reasons for their primitive brains is the fact that additionally to being poisonous, eucalyptus leaves (the only thing they eat) have almost no nutritional value. They can't afford the extra energy to think, they sleep more than 80% of their fucking lives. Non-ecologists always talk this way, and the problem is you’re looking at this backwards. An entire continent is covered with Eucalyptus trees. They suck the moisture out of the entire surrounding area and use allelopathy to ensure that most of what’s beneath them is just bare red dust. No animal is making use of them——they have virtually no herbivore predator. A niche is empty. Then inevitably, natural selection fills that niche by creating an animal which can eat Eucalyptus leaves. Of course, it takes great sacrifice for it to be able to do so——it certainly can’t expend much energy on costly things. Isn’t it a good thing that a niche is being filled? >Koalas are no exception, when their teeth erode down to nothing, they resolve the situation by starving to death This applies to all herbivores, because the wild is not a grocery store—where meat is just sitting next to celery. Herbivores gradually wear their teeth down—carnivores fracture their teeth, and break their bones in attempting to take down prey. >They have one of the smallest brain to body ratios of any mammal It's pretty typical of herbivores, and is higher than many, many species. According to Ashwell (2008), their encephalisation quotient is 0.5288 +/- 0.051. Higher than comparable marsupials like the wombat (\\~0.52), some possums (\\~0.468), cuscus (\\~0.462) and even some wallabies are <0.5. According to wiki, rabbits are also around 0.4, and they're placental mammals. >additionally - their brains are smooth. A brain is folded to increase the surface area for neurons. Again, this is not unique to koalas. Brain folds (gyri) are not present in rodents, which we consider to be incredibly intelligent for their size. >If you present a koala with leaves plucked from a branch, laid on a flat surface, the koala will not recognise it as food. If you present a human with a random piece of meat, they will not recognise it as food (hopefully). Fresh leaves might be important for koala digestion, especially since their gut flora is clearly important for the digestion of Eucalyptus. It might make sense not to screw with that gut flora by eating decaying leaves. >Because eucalyptus leaves hold such little nutritional value, koalas have to ferment the leaves in their guts for days on end. Unlike their brains, they have the largest hind gut to body ratio of any mammal. That's an extremely weird reason to dislike an animal. But whilst we're talking about their digestion, let's discuss their poop. It's delightful. It smells like a Eucalyptus drop! >Being mammals, koalas raise their joeys on milk (admittedly, one of the lowest milk yields to body ratio... There's a trend here). Marsupial milk is incredibly complex and much more interesting than any placentals. This is because they raise their offspring essentially from an embryo, and the milk needs to adapt to the changing needs of a growing fetus. And yeah, of course the yield is low; at one point they are feeding an animal that is half a gram! >When the young joey needs to transition from rich, nourishing substances like milk, to eucalyptus (a plant that seems to be making it abundantly clear that it doesn't want to be eaten), it finds it does not have the necessary gut flora to digest the leaves. To remedy this, the young joey begins nuzzling its mother's anus until she leaks a little diarrhoea (actually fecal pap, slightly less digested), which he then proceeds to slurp on. This partially digested plant matter gives him just what he needs to start developing his digestive system. Humans probably do this, we just likely do it during childbirth. You know how women often shit during contractions? There is evidence to suggest that this innoculates a baby with her gut flora. A child born via cesarian has significantly different gut flora for the first six months of life than a child born vaginally. >Of course, he may not even have needed to bother nuzzling his mother. She may have been suffering from incontinence. Why? Because koalas are riddled with chlamydia. In some areas the infection rate is 80% or higher. Chlamydia was introduced to their populations by humans. We introduced a novel disease that they have very little immunity to, and is a major contributor to their possible extinction. Do you hate Native Americans because they were killed by smallpox and influenza? >This statistic isn't helped by the fact that one of the few other activities koalas will spend their precious energy on is rape. Despite being seasonal breeders, males seem to either not know or care, and will simply overpower a female regardless of whether she is ovulating. If she fights back, he may drag them both out of the tree, Almost every animal does this. >which brings us full circle back to the brain: Koalas have a higher than average quantity of cerebrospinal fluid in their brains. This is to protect their brains from injury... should they fall from a tree. An animal so thick it has its own little built in special ed helmet. I fucking hate them. Errmmm.. They have protection against falling from a tree, which they spend 99% of their life in? Yeah... That's a stupid adaptation."}

Don't think anybody would believe all your grandparents are alive when you're 55. **Edit: For everybody claiming to use your parents,** There's a few reasons why parents are much worse to use than grandparents. 1: You typically only have two of them. Problem is if you take some time off because your \"dad died\", then he actually goes and dies, then you have a shitty situation. Of course you can then say your mum died, but if she dies as well then you're going to have to claim step parents, which may or may not be possible to claim depending on how much personal information you talk about at work. Basically, claiming it is a huge risk if you plan to stay in a company long term. 2: At work it's very unlikely you would mention your grandparents typically to a coworker, not so true with parents. If you claim your dad died and a year or two later you mentioned your dad just moved to Spain, you're going to have issues. Letting stuff slip like that is very easy a long time after your lie. So again, a risk if you plan to stay in a company long term. (If this happens to you, say you meant step parent. They most likely won't believe you, but won't have the balls to say as much) 3: Faking grief for a parent is considerably harder than for a grandparent. When my mum died, I hadn't even talked to her for a year and had a really bad relationship with her, but for the following week I just felt..completely numb and absent.

It was a little weird because we weren't all that close, just a friend of a friend really, but we had helped him with a few little things and visited him a few times. This was over ten years ago and the guy is much older than us and probably in his late 70's or early 80's by now but he has turned into a hermit. We've tried to visit him a few times but he doesn't answer his door even though we can tell he is home. I sometimes wonder if he put us in his will too. I'm not really sure how to feel about the whole thing. Did I mention that he also happens to own about two or three square miles of land that are worth tens of millions of dollars in lumber alone? I figure he has probably changed our names out of the insurance policy and never even included us in his will, but sometimes late at night I wonder if one day we'll get a letter and be instant millionaires. Edit: He actually did more than tell us about it. We had to sign a document or two if I remember correctly. This was somewhere between 2003 and 2006 so my recollection of the events are not too clear."}

I made sure to not use any corporate buzzwords and to have at least one passive aggressive “your company should really (insert thing no company will do)”. She called me laughing the next day asking if I sent it. Her district manager praised her for it and gave her a free product at an impromptu little meeting when he came by that afternoon. She said she only knew it was me because it sounded like a combination of customers she had told me about recently. After that, I’ve used it several times but only once for myself directly.

Anyway, that night was just as hectic as the previous one, and while service went a lot better the other bartender and I never remembered to tell any of the servers about the \"cocktail special\", never told any guests about it, and 100% certainly never made one.

I didn't write it and the other bartender didn't write it so that left only one other person lol.

He wows them by just how PERFECTLY he matches those delicious bold keywords that management sent to the recruiter. He IS perfect. He has some technical questions for the hiring manager,,, and HR happily provides the email address.

I finally dug through the old training manual I had created and now I remember - Ambulance billing SHOULD work the same as those below as far as disputes etc.. The exception that I remembered was: the reason people were going into collections CONSTANTLY for ambulance visits, was because ambulance billing is different. They send the check for the ambulance amount to the patient directly, so the patient will pay the ambulance bill - and then the patients would cash that check, and never pay the ambulance bill, and then get put into collections. As far as insurance was concerned, they DID pay the ambulance bill and it's not their problem. But the ambulance company never saw the $ because the patient would spend it. So - before you cash a check, make sure it's really supposed to be kept by you. I got looped into a thread about medical collections that started with a very inaccurate \"tip,\" and saw that there was a FREAKING TON of misinformation floating around about what to do when you have medical debt. So I thought I'd share the knowledge that I have on the topic from a few years as a trainer in a medical billing & collections agency. **Disclaimer**: I worked for one agency that had multiple sites nationwide in the US. I am not a lawyer, I am NOT giving legal advice. I am just sharing what I know from a few years in the industry including a competitor study that we did to find out how our competitors handle the same situations. I will not share the name of the company I worked for; they were most definitely shady in some areas and I am not looking to dox myself either. If anyone has more knowledge than me on the topic, please chime in. I am also not looking for a \"Healthcare in the US is broken\" because yeah no shit Sherlock; this isn't the thread where we can fix that. Oh also I will swear sometimes in this post. If you have medical debt, these tips may help you to negotiate down or get the debt written off, or to ignore bad advice from people telling you to do something that could have negative repercussions. I'll say \"hospitals\" below but this encompasses all medical providers as far as my experience goes. ***OVERVIEW OF HOW THE INDUSTRY WORKS:*** **Your debt goes in stages:** * Early Out - debt is still owned and usually managed by hospital; may be outsourced to an agency. This is the stage where they can fix any insurance issues as well so **call as soon as you get the bill before it goes into collections**! They're nice when it's still in Early Out; they have to be aggressive when it goes into collections. Some hospitals send their bills from EO to Bad Debt in 30 days; some wait years. So call right away when you get a bill because there's no way to know their timeline. Oftentimes if the amount is low, they will just write it off or take a small payment in the EBO stage. They will work with you. Once it hits Bad Debt aka Collections, the options can be limited. Additionally, the GENERAL rule in health insurance is that you have to resolve the claim within 1 year. Medicaid/Medicare/Tricare had different rules, but in general - getting your insurance to pay after 1 year is not going to happen. CALL WHEN YOU GET THE BILL! * Bad Debt **Contractors** \\- still owned by hospital but using collection agency for the work * Bad Debt **Purchasers** \\- sold off to very aggressive collection agency who has little hope to recover the debt. There are 2 types of med collection agencies - I don't know if there's an official term for each type, but I'll make up my own. * **Contract** \\- the kind that I worked for, that has an active contract with the hospital and gets a small % of the collected amount. * And **Purchasers** \\- the kind that purchases the debts in bulk at a discount and tries to recoup that money and more from you. Facilities usually go through **Contract** agencies before **Purchaser** agencies. ***COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS:*** * **MISCONCEPTION #1: Your medical debt cannot go to collections because it's medical debt.** \\--> Yeah, right. I wish this was true. However, without the collections world, hospitals would close - so it's a reality with our current healthcare system. Know that if you were insured and didn't pay your portion, or if you didn't have insurance AND didn't attempt to get state coverage that would cover those bills, OR were turned down for state insurance....the debt usually lies on your shoulders. They can reduce it, do payment plans, etc. but they can absolutely put you in collections for your car accident, and they will often be forced to do so. * **MISCONCEPTION #2: Medical debt cannot have any long-lasting affects on my credit or property.** \\--> Falsity false, boys. It sure can. The only reason a hospital may not choose to report to the credit bureaus, seize property, or go after your income is usually because it makes them look bad to the community and it's expensive to do the above. But they can and do report to credit if they choose to. Oftentimes it's the last resort after a certain time frame, but \"Sir, this can affect your credit score if not paid\" can be the last option they can use in order to get payment from repeat offenders or low-income areas where the hospital faces a risk of closing if old debts aren't resolved - hospitals have bills to pay too, y'all. At my facility less than 10% of our providers reported to credit, but many still did and it's common. * **MISCONCEPTION #3: Just telling the agency that you want an itemized bill will close out the debt.** \\--> Oh god, false but **COMMONLY** spread misconception. Per FDCPA (Fair Debt Collection Practices Act), it has to pause the collection process (stopping it from reporting to credit & stopping phone calls while they order it from the hospital), but that may be all it does. Once the IB is sent, collection can continue. On rare occasion, the hospital pulls up the IB and sees it was mis-billed or the insurance coding was wrong - but they don't go actively looking for problems at this stage, so don't expect that to happen just from your collection agent asking Sally Receptionist at XYZ Hospital to kick out an IB. You should have called sooner to get this resolved. If it's a low amount, (for us $50 to $100 or less), it wasn't worth the admin cost of requesting an IB. If it was over that amount, we'd always send it if we couldn't convince the client to pay in installments. It's worth the postage and admin costs to get hundreds of dollars in payments. You should know, though, that collection agencies ARE required to send you proof of the debt if you ask, and this is law per FDCPA. However, the statement that the collection agency sends technically counts as your 'proof of debt' because it will contain the date of service, provider name, facility name, and amount. It won't list out each service that was done. But the letter is technically enough to count as proof of debt. That's not as good as the IB so you should push for the IB. They don't want to spend the $ on postage so they will try to avoid sending ANYTHING, but push for it! * **MISCONCEPTION #4: Admitting the debt is yours means they've got you! Hanging up on them stops the process!** \\--> Bitch, please. They know it's yours; they have your address and social security number and they got in touch with you today, didn't they? The only thing you're doing by acknowledging the debt, is confirming that they got the right John Smith on the line. But they pay for skip tracing systems and can and will find you, at every address you register to, and they can call your family as well at least once to get a better address or phone number for you. We paid a team of people minimum wage to sit and skip trace people all day, 40 hours a week. They can find you. They will find you. * **MISCONCEPTION #5: Sending an IB is a violation of my HIPAA rights** or **Collection agencies collecting on medical debt are violating my HIPAA rights! Tell them that you didn't authorize them to collect the debt, and they're violating your HIPAA rights, and you get off free!** \\--> Shut your stupid mouth. Every provider in the USA is required to have you sign something called a Notice of Privacy Practices. You prob signed your NPP in the giant packet before your first appointment. That NPP has very intentional language that lets them use any biller that they choose, and they are permitted per federal law (both FDCPA and HIPAA) to see the bare minimum of your medical info from the appointment in order to collect. They're not violating that law because they can be fined tens of thousands of dollars per violation. Trust me, the paperwork is ironclad. And if my company was any indication of the industry, most of our hospitals did NOT share the reason for the visit, diagnosis, etc. because that was not needed info for collections. We could infer the reason if say it was a labor and delivery provider, but we didn't know why you went. * **MISCONCEPTION #6: My medical debt has no real consequences on me if I ignore it long enough.** \\--> Eh, maybe. If that hospital does not report to credit, and the second agency does not report to credit, and the agencies that buy the debt off don't report to credit, then yes - you may not have your credit score affected. There's no way of knowing what agencies they use and what future policies they may follow when it comes to reporting to credit, though. My agency could legally tell you no, we don't report to credit on THIS account, if we didn't. But then we'd give the account back at 90 days, or 1 year, or whatever, and then the hospital would switch the debt over to our competitor for 1 year, and those bastards did report. So don't assume it will never report. Additionally you can be prevented from using that office in the future if you have outstanding bills. Some of our providers even allowed us to garnish wages. * **MISCONCEPTION #7: Telling them to stop calling me stops all collections for this bill!** \\--> Telling them to stop contacting you stops them from contacting you. If you say stop calling you, they cannot call you ever again. If you say stop calling this #, they can never call that # again. If you say stop contacting me, they cannot call, write, show up, send smoke signals, use a voodoo doll, etc. This is per FDCPA and you can sue them for literally thousands of dollars if they violate this so go for it! But - just because they can't call/write/etc you, that doesn't stop credit reporting, wage garnishments, etc. if those are in the pipeline of the debt. It also legally prevents them from reaching out to you to let you know if they are offering a deal (we offered huge discounts during tax season, for example), it stops them from letting you know if you have future additional bills. Basically you're cutting off your nose to spite your face. Now, if you know 100% beyond a shadow of a doubt that this bill and all future bills for this hospital will not ever hit your credit report, or if you have a 300 credit score and plan to live in your mom's car forever, then go for it. But again, you may also be prevented from seeing doctors as part of this facility's network forever as a result. (The ER is required to take you regardless of your payment history; nobody else is). * **MISCONCEPTION #8: They are asking for my information when they call me; that must be fraud!** \\--> In medical collections, they are bound by HIPAA in addition to FDCPA. They are allowed to ask for your name and give you the address they have on file to see if it's you. They are NOT allowed to mention that they're calling about a medical bill, details on the appointment reasons, or amount until they have confirmed your identity. They cannot tell your family member anything unless it's your legal spouse who verifies your info. ID verification varies but typically it's name/address/year of birth. The agency's lawyer may not be okay with them reading off your YOB so they may ask you to confirm what's on their screen. It seems shady, for sure. But it's for your protection. You can never be too careful. Ask for them to send a letter. Get company name. Ask them what their letter envelope looks like - the FDCPA makes it illegal for the letter to state \"collections\" on the outside of the envelope (for your protection) so it may look like junkmail that you threw out; they have to keep the envelope relatively generic. Ask for the rep's name. Ask to call back in and talk to someone else. Tell them you don't know if they're legit. If they are legit, they'll direct you to a website, a phone # for call-in, they'll resend a letter if you tell them you'll pay, etc. Look up reviews for the agency. But, be aware that the ignorance around collections is widespread and 99% of the bad reviews are going to be people who think it's a scam. That's the nature of collections. But they should be legitimate. They should have a web presence. They should have ads on indeed and other websites to hire people (Collection agents turn over more often than a sex worker in a threesome with one really tall man and one short fat man). * **MISCONCEPTION #9: If you tell them you have a lawyer, the call is over and collection efforts stop!** \\--> *Maaaaybe*. We asked for the lawyer's contact info, advised the consumer to have their lawyer contact us, and immediately stopped all communication to the client and reached out to the lawyer. That stopped all calls and letters and stopped any credit reporting. That being said, if no lawyer contacted us after a certain amount of time, it could begin reporting again in the future. So it's not foolproof. If the lawyer you gave us confirmed that they do NOT represent you, we could legally reopen. If you hung up after saying you have a lawyer, we were stuck waiting to hear from them and if you were lying, well... we're not going to call back...but that doesn't always stop the process. I don't know the time frame on that because I wasn't in the Legal dept, but there was definitely a limit to how long we waited before reporting to credit. **LIES COLLECTION AGENTS TELL YOU:** * ***You have to go through us to pay this debt.*** This may not be true, if the debt exists back in the Contracted stage. The hospital MAY still talk to you about this debt if you call them directly. It's always worth a try. They tell you to go through them because they want their commission if you pay. * ***I cannot take less than $x per month for this bill.*** Nah fam, that agent is simply not going to hit their monthly bonus if they let everyone pay $25 per month on a massive bill. Their boss is going to mad if they take a low payment amount on a big debt. But they absolutely can take your payment of whatever amount you'd like. That being said, it doesn't automatically stop it from reporting to credit just because you're making payments. When you set up a payment plan, ask if it stops the credit reporting process just in case. * ***\"This is a binding contract; if you miss any payments on this payment arrangement, the balance in full is due.\"*** Bro, the balance in full is already OVERdue....you're in collections. Like, duh. They are just trying to lock you in to the payment arrangement. Now if you do miss a payment, it can instantly report to credit - so don't miss a payment. But don't think that your $5000 debt that you agreed to pay out at $200/month is suddenly going to go back up to $5000 due tomorrow if you miss a payment. You already owe $5000. They can and will set up your payment arrangement again. Just call them and ask them to move the date if you need to; they're more than happy to do it. Especially since the new collector could get the credit for the new payment arrangement which goes toward their bonus - hooray for them. **MAGIC WORD:** **I DISPUTE the validity of this debt**. Oh hell yes, use this phrase. It stops all collection efforts, stops credit reporting, and basically creates a full system shutdown on this debt. The agency should ask the reason for the dispute, but you do not have to provide it. They will then kick out an itemized bill to prove the validity of the debt. However - oftentimes if there was a dispute, we just closed out the debt altogether and were done, with zero negative consequences. I used to teach my agents how to tell the difference between a real dispute vs. a fake dispute, but in reality **if the D-word is said, it's a dispute.** Good, valid, morally and ethically positive reasons to dispute a debt: I didn't receive that service, the appointment was canceled, I never got a bill in the first place, someone else was supposed to pay (divorce or car accident), identify fraud, I was injured during this procedure. Bullshit reasons to dispute: The doctor was mean, I'm racist and the doctor was X ethnicity, I don't want to pay, my insurance should have paid this. But again if you say **DISPUTE** \\- they can ask more questions to see if it's a real dispute, but ultimately you CAN sue them if you tell them you're disputing it and they don't immediately pause reporting to credit while they investigate. **THINGS YOU CAN THEORETICALLY SUE THE AGENCY OVER:** \\-If you say dispute and they don't stop credit reporting to investigate - HUGE no-no; report per FDCPA. \\-If they give out your health information to someone who was not confirmed to be you, per their verification process. HUGE no-no; report per HIPAA. \\-If they say it's a **debt** before confirming it's you that they have on the line - FDCPA violation, do not pass go. **What to do on every medical collections call:** \\-Get the name of the agency and the representative you're speaking with; write down date and time. This may be needed in the future if they break FDCPA or HIPAA; it can also help with disputes or conversations with management later on. \\-Ask as many questions as you need to in order to help you learn if it's a valid debt. When was this, who was the provider, how much was my original bill, what insurance did you bill to, do I have additional bills in your system? \\-Ask what happened with your insurance. How much did my insurance pay, did they say why this amount was left over? \\-Call your insurance to see what happened if the agency isn't clear. There is a possibility that it can be re-billed even after it's in Bad Debt. \\-Be friendly and polite. Agents have a good bit of freedom to grant discounts and set up comfortable payment plans, and they'll only use those kindnesses if you're not a douche. Also, they're humans too, probably making $2 above minimum wage, and the job is really tough because people are mean and have heartbreaking stories. Be human. It helps."}

The sad part is that this will not do any good. These \"companies\" utilize a robo-dialer that will dial all numbers in a block of numbers to identify potential targets. The first call will check if a person answers the phone. These are usually a pre-recorded message that plays as soon as you say hello. Once the successful contact is made, that number becomes flagged as an active number to be called. Then the real scam calls start... The ones with a live person on the other end. Like previously mentioned, there is no point trying to reverse lookup these numbers, as the scammers are able to make the number to match whatever they want it to be. Most times it will match an area code and prefix from near you since more people are likely to answer those calls.. (My number was used by an auto-dialer once. I got quite a few calls from people asking why I called them. Most of them did not believe it wasn't me.) Some best practices to use when getting a call from an unknown number is to not say anything when you answer the phone. This will keep the recording from playing usually, and flags your number as inactive. If the recording does play, don't say anything or hit any buttons as this can flag your number as active and prompt more calls. After using those best practices, I now only get 2 to 3 robo calls a week, instead of the 5 to 10 some people get in a day. There are a lot of apps out that are supposed to help. It doesn't hurt to use the ones that are from trusted sources, but I wouldn't spend money on one. Hope someone found this useful."}

You're trying to close the store, so a single person getting fired shouldnt be a big deal. Offer to pay the kid as long as he puts does this. remind him that it is illegal for his hours to get cut or for him to be fired out of retaliation. Have your Walmart spy ask around to see if anyone tenured at the store is interested in leading a union. Offer a couple thousand in real money to fund any legitimate attempts. keep the reciepts. What is a few grand compared to your future livelihood? By now, you almost certainly would have corporate's attention. send a few more \"anonymous\" emails about your concerns with how management seems to be backing the union, but that they are so entrenched that nobody would dare admit it. Drop some names that you acquired using your spy. send the receipts to back up the claims. lastly, contact Walmart as yourself saying you are willing to bankroll the unionization attempts. See if you can make them fear you. Politely state the lengths you are willing to go to unionize their store. Make up an inheritance your family would be happy to lend to the cause. And some more thouths from me: Amazing ideas, also, I was thinking, print some leaflets that read something like: (Heavy paraphrasing) \"\"\"you have parked your car here for more than 4 hours, the limit is 3 hours if this happens again you will be fined, if you are an employee please email us your employee ID and license plate, (insert fake email address you made to look like it belongs to a parking enforcement company\"\"\" Put those pamphlets on cars that Park there early in the morning and late at night, and you will receive the email addresses of many employees"}

I kept getting calls asking for a Mr Hasal. I informed the woman every time that she had the wrong number and that no-one by that name lived here, and she would promptly hang up - often before I even finished my sentence. It was super annoying. One day the phone rang and I answered, and it was the woman again. Once more she asked for Mr Hasal. “Yes, this is Mr Hasal”, I replied. She then asked me to confirm that I’d purchased some washing machine a couple of years prior, and again I confirmed. She then proceeded to tell me that my machine’s insurance was nearing its expiry date and wanted to know whether I was interested in extending it. I refrained from immediately answering and instead began to breathe a little louder. After a pause, she asked if I was still there. “Oh yes sorry, I’m here. You’ve just called at a bad time”. Undeterred, she asked again if I wanted to extend my washing machine’s insurance. My breathing got louder. “Hello?”, she asked. “Hi!”, I replied. Again she asks about extending this insurance. “Sorry, I’m a little busy here. But I’m not sure you really want to know how.” Of course, she asks how. “Well...”, I said slowly and with some panting in between, “I was feeling a bit horny earlier and I’m alone in the house with time to spare so I’ve unzipped and...” I hear the lady exclaim to a colleague, “Oh my God, he’s wanking!”, before she hangs up. I haven’t heard from her since. Edit: So after lurking for years before finally starting to contribute about a year ago, my highest rated comment is about pretending to masturbate on the phone with a stranger. Thanks guys! Another edit: I should perform this routine more often! Thank you kind stranger!"}

I think too that spray paint can be seen as a weapon which is another matter to deal with. You'd have to be fairly close if the wind and movement from others doesn't fuck up your flow. If you want proper sprating though for effectiveness, make sure your cans stay as warm as possible cause it'll spray the best and requires less shaking. If you want the most effective paint, get gloss paint; it's a fucking mess to work with overall and is sticky as all hell before drying. . Edit for most effective ideals while causing no real harm: A super soaker or even better, a bug sprayer, filled with Angelus Leather Acrylic Paint mixed with just a hint of water is the best idea. It is highly pigmented and can be diluted almost to that of water and will dry very fast and is sticky if painted in thick globs. Has good grip. I guess spraying it like it's a giant mustard container wpuld work too. Hell, use condiment dispensers filled with store bought paint, that would work even better."}
