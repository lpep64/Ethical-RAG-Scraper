People were polite, but I could tell they didn't really want me around. Then I started paying attention to the people everyone gravitated toward. Turns out, likability isn't some mysterious talent just specific behaviors anyone can learn. Here are the 7 things that changed everything for me: 1. Ask questions about them, not about yourself. Instead of \"I went to that restaurant too!\" try \"What did you think of the food there?\" People love talking about themselves when someone genuinely cares. 2. Remember small details from previous conversations. \"How did your sister's wedding go?\" or \"Did you finish that book you mentioned?\" Shows you actually listen instead of just waiting for your turn to talk. 3. Give genuine compliments on things they chose. Don't compliment looks compliment decisions and skills. \"That's such a good point\" or \"I love how you decorated this place.\" They feel proud instead of just flattered. 4. Match their energy level (but stay slightly calmer) If they're excited, be interested. If they're upset, be concerned. But always stay 10% more composed. You become the stable person they feel good around. 5. Use their name in conversations. Not every sentence, but sprinkle it in. \"That's funny, Sarah\" or \"What do you think, Mike?\" People subconsciously love hearing their own name. 6. Be the first to help, last to judge (something most people fail to do). Offer to grab coffee when they're stressed. Don't give advice unless they ask. Just be useful and supportive without making it about you. Most of the time people want to be heard not to be lectured. 7. Admit when you don't know something \"I have no idea about that, tell me more\" is way more likable than pretending to know everything. People enjoy teaching someone who's genuinely curious. The \"I know it all attitude\" is seen as annoying and weird avoid it. Make every interaction about making THEM feel good about themselves, not about making yourself look good. What I wish I'd known earlier is likability isn't about being funny, smart, or impressive. It's about being genuinely interested in other people and making them feel heard. I use no.2 a lot and has helped me become friend with people at work.

Then the pain of my having bad social skills got bad enough. The isolation started to feel less like a choice and more like a prison. That's when I re-opened the book and started applying the principles for real this time. I went from being ignored to people asking advice for me now. Here’s the raw, unfiltered breakdown of the techniques I stole from Carnegie that actually changed everything: * I started using names a lot. It felt unnatural, almost manipulative at first. Instead of a generic \"thanks,\" it became \"Thanks, Sarah.\" Instead of \"good point,\" it was \"That's a sharp insight, Mike.\" I expected people to find it weird. Instead, they lit up. Their entire demeanor changed. You can see a flicker of recognition in their eyes, a small spark that says, \"You see me.\" * forced myself to become interested. I used to fake interest in other people's lives. It was exhausting and transparent. But instead of letting that past I decided to find somethin we can connect to. This was especially great when I realized my other co-worker also liked to draw. We became friends instantly when I knew he can also paint. * I forced myself to be humble. My old self was desperate to prove my intelligence. I’d correct people, one-up their stories, and offer unsolicited \"better\" ways of doing things. It was pure insecurity. I switched tactics. Now, when someone explains something, I ask, \"How did you even think of that?\" or \"What was your process for figuring that out?\" People hate being corrected. * stopped pointing out mistakes. A coworker screws up in a meeting. The old me might have pointed it out to look sharp but now \"I think those numbers might be from last quarter, we should double-check,\" or \"I might be misremembering, but I thought we agreed on X.\" It gives them an out. They get to fix the mistake without being publicly humiliated. They never forget who had their back in a moment of weakness. It helps a lot. * Instead of thinking what to say, I listened. I used to treat conversations like a debate. While the other person was talking, I'd think of what to say next. It was exhausting because I was performing a constant mental juggling act. I forced myself to stop. To just shut up and absorb what the other person was *actually saying*. To ask questions about *their* points. Suddenly, conversations weren't work anymore. When you stop trying to steer, you can actually enjoy the ride. * I celebrated people's wins. When a coworker did something well, I’d mention it to others, especially to people in charge. \"Did you see how Sarah handled that client? It was brilliant.\" It costs you nothing. Zero effort. But the person you celebrated will see you as an ally for life. People never forgive those who gossip about them but never forget those who praise them behind their backs. I hope this was helpful. This is what I use a lot even now. If you have questions feel free to ask.

It was part of the birth of what many now call \"self-help\" and spoke to an audience that had NO common vocabulary for such things. It definitely reflects the social norms and class-based perspective of the time. While it can be a great place to start if it resonates with you, it's exactly that... the start of a journey rather than an end point. If practiced literally, you'll almost certainly get a few strange reactions and suspicious looks. It has valuable principles that have been around long enough to be considered common sense, and also has some pitfalls that are worth avoiding"}

When someone uses my name when it is already implied, this comes across as patronizing. Each time they do it, the relationship seems a little less respectful and less genuine. 2. If you have an intellect, a small amount of natural curiosity, are listening to what someone is saying and are not cognitively overwhelmed, then you will not need to force a polite level of interest when the person mentions something interesting. 3. \"Don't be an insecure asshole\" is not a life hack. 4. Disagreeing or correcting in a polite rather than punitive way is not doing someone a favor. It's just being polite. 5. Actually listening while people are talking is not a big secret. It's just effective listening. 6. No one knows when you praise them behind their backs. Giving people credit for their work is just called \"integrity\". But the comment implies in the past that you have gossiped against people, and see the office as a political battlefield with friends and enemies. There is unfortunately a certain degree of truth to that in many places, but the people with practical skills do their best to avoid all of it as much of it as possible."}

If you use someone's name because you know it'll make them happy and bring you closer in friendship is going to be taken better than if you're just parroting it back as if it's a script. I've been in sales my entire life and I can pick out the difference. I can immediately see the people who use my name because some sales manual said they need to use my name at least once every 3 sentences.. Same thing with Zig Ziglar.. If you're just pulling the stuff out and mechanically using his suggestions then it comes off as crappy sales. I had a sales manager who went off on Zig because it was all old fashioned and phoney.. But if you understand the nuance and use it in a way to genuinely attempt to reach people and make their lives better then its going to come off as more genuine (eventually...

Carnegie's frame is centralized on the idea that People are problems to manage, not nervous systems to meet. Followed literally, his books prioritize public influence over genuine authenticity. They are literally a how to manual for people pleasing at the cost of personal boundaries. People-pleasing is \"a behavioral pattern characterized by prioritizing the needs and desires of others over one's own, often to gain approval or avoid conflict. It involves consistently striving to please others, sometimes to the point of self-sacrifice and neglecting of one's own needs.\" If influencing people comes at the cost of my own authenticity, I refuse. If friendship comes at the cost of distorting my own natural signals for the sole purpose of appeasing others in their comfortability, I am not willing. If making friends and influencing people revolves around abandoning my own self, this is not worth it. Carnegies book is a great explanation on how to influence people's perceptions. But I disagree that controlling perception equates to friendship. If that were the case, wouldn't politicians have the most amount of true friends? Don't criticize, condemn, or complain - Abuse victims get trapped while alcoholics throw things at each other or at them. They stay quiet about the abuse because to do otherwise would be too negative to be listened to & would block Carnegies claim of human connection. Give honest and sincere appreciation. - you do this but because you're autistic you say it with no eye contact with a flat affect and everyone assumes it is sarcastic so then your accurate signal gets misinterpreted. Carnegie fails to mention that only appreciation that is in the expected empathetic performative way gets valued. - The idea that appreciation is universally recognized is a false premise. Hence the double empathy problem in autism. - appreciation, when it is real, is highly valued, the problem becomes when it becomes so performative that it becomes completely fake and fabricated in order to fulfill a goal of a specific image. \"Arouse in the other person an eager want.\" - translates to, withhold information - Be vague to allow other person to fill in their own projections - This is fine if their projections include connecting with you. However, what if the desired goal requires transparency and precision? - Henceforth, performance is assumed to be more valuable than accuracy. Sometimes the case, not always. - This then creates a reward pattern for human manipulation. - Avoiding clarity if it risks discomfort comes at the cost of ambiguity breaking down things systematically / projection jumps. \"Become genuinely interested in other people.\" - not terrible advice - However, it doesn't capture that if your interest in other people exceeds a certain amount, they begin to get uncomfortable. (E.g \"it's creepy how interested you are in this topic) - OR taken literally romantic interest is assumed because the other person believes no one could genuinely care about them THAT much unless they were romantically interested. (Or guys being seen as creepy, girls being seen as flirting) - most people bonding over shared cues and not mirrored nervous systems and shared pattern depth - Carnegies frame fails because it assumes interest = safety but if you show genuine interest towards an abuser or manipulator, guess who gets trapped? - Obviously I'm not saying to NEVER show genuine interest but what I am telling you is that most people HAVE an unspoken limit they don't feel comfortable surpassing."}

Trans people's dead names. - Using name too often sounds fake, rehearsed, manipulative, or like you're trying to sell something Be a good listener. Encourage others to talk about themselves. - taken to its logical extreme results in 'why are you interrogating me?' - Second creates unequal power dynamic teaching people that what they have to say is meaningless compared to the other person. - encourages robotic conversation -> look at AI if you want a real example here. Is manufactured care and empathy still real empathy? Is empathy nothing more than the correct series of words? Is self erasure worth a perceived influence? - Or you ask something they don't feel comfortable with disclosing and you don't know they're uncomfortable because they never say it but they assume you can see they're uncomfortable with it so they assume it's intentional & hate you. There is no universal internal map of what should be obvious. - The more you know about a person the more you see their vulnerability which scares the fuck out of most people. - If you encourage the other person to only talk about their interests and then they do the same to you how does anyone ever form a connection? People want to be heard only to the extent that it doesn’t mirror their pain too clearly. • People want intimacy only when they still feel in control of their image. • And if you see too much — especially silently — they might decide you are the threat. Talk in terms of the other person’s interest. - social strategy: self abandonment - Never ever talking about anything you like does not build a real connection. - How would you ever know if that person is aligned with your values if they don't know a damn thing about you? - So sure they LOVE your mask...yet no one ever knows YOU. And that YOU is worthy as fuck of being seen. Make the other person feel important — and do it sincerely. - double empathy gap strikes again - Nobody will believe you if it doesn't match their expected performance. - You can be autistically sincere and say the kindest things in the world to someone but if it doesn't match their mapping, their perception, of neurotypical performative kindness then it will not be well received. - Carnegies frame assumes that if you truly mean it, they will feel it, which is an invalid frame. The only way to get the best of an argument is to avoid it. Potential problems: 1. what if a discussion of disagreement is necessary? 2. Should disagreement of any kind be seen as rude? 3. Doesn't the bystander effect continue to perpetuate abuse? Show respect for the other person’s opinions. Never say, ‘You’re wrong. - protects perception over accuracy - If people don't know if they've made a mistake, how can they possibly improve or change? - If you incorrectly assume that their mapping is the same as yours; it leads to a culture that rewards faking performance over actual results. - And again, why is disagreement seen as rude? If you are wrong, admit it quickly and emphatically. - taken to its literal extreme, you slowly degrade your own reputation and throw yourself under the bus and others believe you are incompetent. - This teaches submission, not attunement. But taken literally, it trains conscientious people to self-sabotage — - while those who mask or manipulate their image experience no reputational penalty at all. Begin in a friendly way. - ok, well my definition of friendly is someone who doesn't lie to me, who doesn't use performance to try to manipulate my beliefs and actions, and someone who genuinely is matching with what I am interested it rather than masking that. However, if I begin from this frame, others see my lack of performance as unfriendly because we have different definitions. - Neurotypical presentation of empathetic isn't the only possible definition of friendly. - Plus, the phrase \"sickeningly sweet\" and \"butter me up\" exists for a reason. If you're too nice people think that is manipulative, which also sucks. - Furthermore it encourages masking over genuine connection and genuine self expression. It convinces people that it's more important to sell yourself for others than to listen to your own nervous system. - Then You internalize that truthful presence is dangerous unless carefully dressed up. So then you learn ok, I have to script everything just to be seen as valuable or treated as a person. You question your unscripted self's right to EXIST. Get the other person saying ‘yes, yes’ immediately. - so manipulating people to say yes is what constitutes true empathy? - This trains automatic agreement. What if you actually WANT someone to think for themselves? - Language manipulation like this programs them to follow along because their neurotransmitters are pre-programmed to do so.....AND Let the other person feel that the idea is theirs. - this is textbook manipulation - If they believe the idea is theirs, then why would they ever need you? - Then people get praised for ideas they didn't come up with which then encourages them to continue performative tendencies rather than real progress - This teaches people to value feeling smart over becoming wise. Call attention to people’s mistakes indirectly. - great, so if they're autistic they won't understand because you refuse to offer signal clarity out of your own fears of being judged, so they won't ever be able to change or improve because nobody can outright say to them 'do it this way instead'? - Or worse, the attention called is so indirect it is never even perceived to begin with? - Or worse, the mistakes you believe they are making are empathy gaps on your part??? End with: If someone influences your decision without your awareness, did you really choose it?”"}

PSYZONIC‍☠️ ---------------------------- PROTOCOL 1: IDENTIFY THE SOURCE CODE A Psyzonic Deep-Dive into Belief Decompilation 0. THE PRINCIPLE: MINDS ARE BUILT ON FOUNDATIONS OF PAIN Every person’s behavior, decisions, and emotional reactions are not random. They are outputs generated by a hidden internal operating system—a network of core beliefs formed through repetition, trauma, and reinforcement. Most people interact with the output (behavior). You will learn to reverse-engineer the source code (belief). → Your goal is not to change what they do. → It is to rewrite what they are. 1. THE BELIED AUDIT: UNCOVERING THE CORE SCRIPT You are a digital archaeologist. Your tools are observation, language, and pattern recognition. A. Linguistic Forensics (What They Say) Absolute Language: Listen for words like always, never, everyone, no one. → I always get left behind. → Belief: I am inadequate. → No one ever understands me. → Belief: I am alone. Self-Identifying Statements: How they define themselves. → I’m just a anxious person. → Belief: My anxiety is my identity. → I don’t do well under pressure. → Belief: I am fragile. B. Behavioral Pattern-Mapping (What They Do) Repetitive Sabotage: How they consistently undermine their own success. → Example: Someone who starts arguments before achieving intimacy. → Belief: I am unworthy of love, so I must destroy it first. Investment Inconsistencies: Where they pour energy vs. where they claim to want results. → Example: Claims to want a promotion but avoids visibility. → Belief: Success will expose my inadequacy. C. Emotional Triggers (What They Feel) Overreactions: Disproportionate emotional responses are cracks in the facade. → Explosive anger over a small criticism → Belief: I must be perfect to be loved. → Deep shame over a minor mistake → Belief: I am fundamentally broken. 2. THE TRIGGER INVENTORY: MAPPING ACTIVATION POINTS Beliefs lie dormant until activated. Your targets will have specific activation sequences—people, topics, or scenarios that trigger the core belief into action. → People: Authority figures, ex-partners, parents, rivals. → Topics: Money, status, loyalty, abandonment, failure. → Scenarios: Public speaking, rejection, being ignored, receiving praise. How to Extract This: → Passive Elicitation: What’s something that instantly puts you in a bad mood? → Observation: Note sudden shifts in posture, tone, or eye movement when a topic arises. → Pattern Tracking: Keep a mental (or physical) log of what preceded an emotional reaction. 3. THE HIERARCHY OF BELIEFS: UNDERSTANDING THE CHAIN OF COMMAND Not all beliefs are created equal. They exist in a hierarchy: → Identity Beliefs: Deepest level. “I am unlovable.” → Rule Beliefs: Strategies to cope. “Therefore, I must push people away before they leave me.” → Surface Behaviors: The visible output. “I start fights over nothing.” → Your target’s behavior is only the symptom. The identity belief is the disease. 4. FIELD EXERCISE: THE 5-MINUTE PROFILE Your first practical assignment. Next conversation: → Listen for one absolute statement (I never…, People always…). → Note the emotional charge—frustration, resignation, anger? → Ask one follow-up question: What happens if that always thing actually changed? Observe the reaction: Defense? Confusion? Curiosity? The reaction tells you how brittle or malleable the belief is. WARNING: ETHICAL CONTAINMENT → This is not a parlor trick. Uncovering core beliefs exposes raw psychological nerve endings. To use this without being destructive: → You are a surgeon, not a torturer. Your goal is understanding, not harm. → This knowledge is a diagnostic tool, not a weapon. Weaponization comes later. → If you cannot handle the responsibility of seeing someone’s source code, you have no business trying to rewrite it. You now possess the first key. You are no longer interacting with people—you are auditing systems. Your next transmission will cover Protocol 2: The Injection Method—how to introduce new code into a running system without triggering defensive protocols. 1% are now awake.

I'm not saying they're not guided by emotions or instincts, but that it means you may have to up your game in the \"logic\" department. The other situation is in online discussions where emotions and signals you'd find IRL can't easily be conveyed. Here's another thing though, logic = \\ = truth. If they can point out logical inconsistencies it will destroy your credibility and chances at persuading them. A persuasive argument to me, isn't necessarily a truthful one, but it is a logically valid one wrapped up with emotions and instinctual appeals. All this said, we're all mammals, we may have different preferred types of evidence, different standards of evidences to believing in something, different needs, different appeals, different emotions, etc. but ultimately there's still a sequence to arrive at a conclusion we all follow that can be mapped out. Sort of like the 7 stages of grief. Sure we may not start at the beginning stage all the time, but it's still a process that applies to pretty much everyone. If there's exceptions, it usually means the model is insufficient, not that it's impossible to map out a model in the first place."}

The map can be used as guidance to help you understand where and how you might target an approach, but you have to understand that every situation is unique, and that any approach you come up with will necessarily not apply universally. This is even true for actual cartographic maps as well, the map is not the territory. I’m not necessarily a fan of any specific/prescriptive formula for this sort of thing.

Further I think you’re wildly overestimating the average critical thinking skill or even the average literacy. IIRC something like half of adults in the US are at least partially illiterate (not meeting however the OECD defines “level 3 literacy” or whatever.) this is why almost all business or marketing communications are written on-purpose to an “8th grade level, or below”, which doesn’t even make sense as a metric anymore since national literacy skills have plummeted across the board. People are fundamentally driven by emotion in-general, and something shockingly close to 1 out of 2 people are almost exclusively driven by emotion, because they actually can’t follow certain kinds of logic. All this without even considering the backfire effect, when people can follow a chain of logic they’re still more likely to double down on their own preconceived biases, and the backfire seems even stronger when presented with concrete, cited evidence to the contrary. I suppose I can applaud you for making the assumption that enough people are both “intelligent and practical” to see through biases and emotions, but I’m living in a country that is providing a massive set of evidence to the contrary."}

If you can pull up old posts or accounts linked to someone’s face, you suddenly have background info, writing style, maybe even personal details they shared years ago. That could make building trust or tailoring a pretext way easier for someone who wanted to exploit it. It made me wonder how many people even realize their digital past is still sitting out there waiting to be resurfaced. We talk a lot about phishing and manipulation techniques here but I feel like tools that connect faces to forgotten accounts could open a whole other layer of attack surface.

Conversations would die when I joined them. People would give me polite smiles and find excuses to walk away. I'd leave parties feeling invisible and confused. Turns out, I had developed 5 toxic social habits that were pushing people away without me even realizing it. I thought I was being friendly, confident, or interesting. I didn't know I was being annoying. So here's the 5 habits that can make people dislike you and how to overcome it: Habit 1 - Making Everything About You Someone mentions their vacation and you immediately jump in with \"Oh that reminds me of when I went to...\" Someone shares a problem and you respond with \"That's nothing, let me tell you about MY situation...\" I was a conversation interrupter. Every story became a launching pad for my own stories. Every problem became an opportunity to one-up someone. Instead of doing this ask follow-up questions instead. \"How did that make you feel?\" \"What was the best part?\" Let them finish their story before sharing yours. Habit 2 - Being a Phone Zombie Nothing says \"you're not important\" like checking your phone while someone's talking to you. I thought I was being subtle. Quick glances at notifications, responding to \"urgent\" texts, scrolling while pretending to listen. People notice every single time. And they take it personally. Phone face down or in your pocket. If you're expecting something urgent, tell people upfront. Otherwise, be present. It's uncomfortable talking to someone in their phone always. Habit 3 - Complaining Constantly \"Traffic was horrible.\" \"My boss is an idiot.\" \"This weather sucks.\" \"I'm so tired.\" I was dumping negativity on everyone around me. I thought I was just sharing my day. Really, I was emotionally draining people. For every complaint, share something positive. Or better yet, complain less and ask about their day more. As a bonus compliment people. It'll make their day and they'll remember it. Habit 4 - Interrupting and Finishing People's Sentences I thought I was being helpful by finishing people's thoughts. I thought I was showing I understood by jumping in before they finished. Actually, I was being disrespectful as hell. When you interrupt, you're saying \"what I have to say is more important than what you're saying.\" Count to three after someone stops talking before you respond. Let silence happen. People often have more to say. Plus if you don't interrupt it means you value what the other person is saying. Habit 5 - Being a Know-It-All \"Actually, that's not quite right...\" \"Well, technically...\" \"I read an article that said...\" I couldn't let anything slide. Every conversation became a fact-checking session. Every opinion became a debate I had to win. Nobody likes being corrected in casual conversation. Save the Wikipedia facts for trivia night. Ask yourself \"Does this really matter?\" before correcting someone. Choose connection over being right. If it doesn't just don't say anything. Just let things happen normally. No need to be the I know it all guy. People don't care how smart you are or how interesting your stories are. They care about how you make them feel. As a side note make people feel heard, not lectured. Make them feel important, not interrupted. Make them feel positive, not drained. Your job in social situations isn't to impress people. It's to make them comfortable and valued. The people who are magnetic aren't the ones with the best stories. They're the ones who make others feel like they have the best stories.

If your social group doesn't like you being a know-it-all, it may be because they're ... kinda dumb. Or at the very least, they're emotional, and they don't like having logic controvert their feelings or beliefs. That's a fairly common discomfort. Intellectuals are more accustomed to being wrong, and changing their ideas to fit the facts, and assuaging the negative emotional response of doing so. They can emotionally handle being wrong, and they take comfort in avoiding any negative consequences of their prior ignorance. Curious types \\*adore\\* learning new things. The discomfort of being corrected pales in comparison to the joy of learning something new. The right social group does not see challenging ideas as being a know-it-all; they see it as being a polymath, philosopher, or reconnaissance. It's something to be celebrated, and the intrigue that follows that challenge is sure to be delightful. The curious learners who really do care about your smart and interesting stories are all over the place: offices, libraries, universities, and weirdly enough I find a lot of them at the climbing gym. But the rest of the advisement is sound. It's ok to regale others with interesting stories, but do take their feelings into account. It's ok, *so long as they want to hear them*. In the right crowd, that's a good long while they'd like to listen."}

But we are getting out of it and ever so slowly I’m building a social circle where conversation is about learning, improving, sharing information and also correcting each other. It’s incredibly helpful having someone that can tell you when your thinking is off and who helps you reflect on it with an outsider perspective. It’s magical how everyone leaves meetups feeling like a small part of their life has changed, every single time. No conflict, no fighting, no rambling. Now I’ve reached a point where regular conversation feels absolutely horrible to me. Just sharing random stories about what happened that day, or talking about other people feels wrong in so many ways. I hope things continue developing this way.

Turns out, it wasn't what I was saying it was HOW I was saying it. These small changes in how you speak can completely transform how people see you: 1. Slow down your speech. Nervous talkers rush their words. Confident people take their time. Speak like every word has weight. People will lean in instead of tuning out. 2. Lower your voice at the end of statements. Don't end sentences like questions? It makes everything sound uncertain? Lower your tone at the end. It signals confidence and finality. 3. Use fewer filler words \"Um,\" \"like,\" \"you know\" these kill your credibility. Pause instead. Silence shows you're thinking, not just filling space. Pauses make people pay attention. Because that way they understand you put effort into the words you say. 4. Stop over-explaining \"I think we should do X\" hits harder than \"Well, I mean, maybe we could try X, but I don't know, what do you think?\" Say what you mean. Period. Don't make it long but keep it short. 5. Match or mirror their volume If someone speaks softly, don't shout. If they're animated, bring energy. But always stay slightly calmer than them. You become the steady presence in the room. 6. Use definitive language. Replace \"I feel like\" with \"I think.\" Replace \"maybe\" with \"likely.\" Replace \"I guess\" with \"I believe.\" Own your words. The kind of words you use dictate the image people have to you. As much as possible don't swear especially in professional settings. 7. Don't fill every silence. Let your words breathe. When you finish making a point, stop talking. The urge to keep explaining shows insecurity. Plus the more you talk the more people will care. 8. Speak to the person, not the group. Even in group settings, make eye contact with individuals. \"John, what's your take?\" vs \"What does everyone think?\" Direct connection creates respect. Because the more you talk to everyone the less chances anyone will respond. What I noticed when I started doing this: People stopped interrupting me mid-sentence. My ideas actually got heard and considered. Colleagues started asking for my opinion instead of talking around me. I realized I was apologizing for having thoughts. \"Sorry, but I think...\" or \"This might be dumb, but...\" Stop apologizing for existing. Your ideas have value. Speak like you believe it. Practice this: Record yourself having a conversation (with permission). Listen back. Count the filler words, notice your tone, hear how you end sentences. It's eye-opening. Or just record yourself talking to yourself. It works either way. How you speak is how people think of you think (Perception). If you sound uncertain, they assume you are uncertain. If you sound weak they will assume you are not trustworthy. You don't need to be the loudest person in the room to command respect. You just need to sound like you respect yourself first. Keep learning. I had to learn this for years. Have a good day!

(To be fair he also is unquestionably the foremost authority/expert on what we do. He can solve an issue any of us have been struggling with for weeks in a minute or less without seeming to even have a spike in his heart rate ). But both he and another person like him I met long ago ALSO carried themselves like this in speech. Slow, calm and deliberate. He uses likely and not maybe - something I didn’t notice until now. He never rushes to speak but as soon as he speaks we listen. I can’t remember if I’ve ever heard him say ‘I think’, or if he does it’s less often. Instead he often says ‘it’s possible that…’, ‘if i remember correctly’ (as well as ‘likely’). Now we don’t have a cutthroat team and everyone respects each other where I interact with him, so there’s that - but he always appears unflappable and as if he is devoid of any anxiety or uncertainty in himself - without appearing cocky or over confident. He comes off as if he’s just reading the answer from a textbook. If one of us says something massively incorrect, he just slow blinks at us and calmly corrects us without any other indication of annoyance or any joy in proving us wrong. It’s a pleasure working with him so I really appreciate that this list doesn’t include things that make you come off as someone people might listen to, but will also resent."}

I try to incorporate a lot of these ideas too and can confirm they go a long way in making one a more effective communicator. I would add: Listen much more than you speak. This allows you to really cogitate over what you're going to say next and forces you to slow things down. I know that kinda goes along with the parts you wrote about utilizing silence more, but I feel it can have its own spot on the list. Just reinforces all of the ways silence can be an effective communicative tool. Also, this doesn't have anything to do with verbal communication directly, but so much of our communication is nonverbal, and confidence is one of the most critical aspects of nonverbal communication. This is an entire field of its own so I don't want to get too deep in another direction, but by far one of the most effective ways to radiate confidence in any situation is to be in superlative physical shape. As someone who has been working out and eating healthy for years, I can say with 100% conviction that being in noticeable physical shape gets me much more baseline respect and makes people more perceptive to what I have to say when I speak. Part of that comes from how confidence permeates off of me and others pick up on it (like I genuinely feel the confidence in a tangible way), but its also a result of people subconsciously realizing that it takes a lot of discipline, hard work, sacrifice, and other positive qualities to dedicate yourself to training hard and eating healthy every single day, so the small percentage of us who do so are going to stand out of the crowd who, let's be real, are mostly overweight or physically inferior in some way, which will manifest somewhere in their confidence or nonverbal communication."}

I It's because people don't really have general, actionable tendencies separate from the situations they find themselves in, and the conscious plans they make. That belief just hasn't been proven true. People are unpredictable animals. When threatened by someone, sometimes people fight back, sometimes they run, sometimes they'll freeze, appease, or do something completely out of pocket. People will pretend that there's a pattern, ignore the outliers and say \"Jerry is a real fighter\", but it's just cherry picking at best. It's people making patterns so they can construct a model of the world that makes sense to them. Situation is a better predictor. The environment. How people perceive the world and people around them. >give some of these situational factor examples An easy example is understanding comfort in familiarity. If you're breaking bad news to someone, and wanna avoid fallout, you don't do it in a place they're not stable in. Instead of telling them at work, tell them at home, or at a favorite café, or in their workshop. Places where, even in light of bad news, they feel stable, safe, and in control. This is the stuff you write down about them instead of waxing philosophical about their deep seeded feelings of inferiority. If you can't control where you meet, try to alter things a bit. Give them a gift, or try to pull them aside to a quieter place for a moment. Build rapport, make their day a bit better both before and after, and importantly: Pay attention to how you're supposed to do that for the person in question. Write down the identities and subcultures they're a part of so you can regulate your own behavior accordingly. You are a part of their environment whenever you're working with them, and the way you break bad news to, make a request of, or make friends with people differs from social group to social group. You tell a \"wine mom\" they're worth it, they might cry on your shoulder or find it endearing/cute. That is friendly behavior in that type of social circle. You do that to a hyper masculine tough-guy \"biker man\", you may get laughed out from where you're standing, or fed your teeth because that behavior is taken as demeaning. Even something as simple as your speech mannerisms can change how your actions are perceived, so understand the norms of their social groups well enough to fit in, and not make social faux pas. Observe how their friends interact with them, and how they interact with others, and mirror that behavior."}

Most people think she’s charming and fun, but I’ve seen the manipulative side — and so have my closest friends (the ones not friends with her) Confrontation hasn’t worked; if anything, it feeds her, and makes her talk more smack about me. I want to implement a strategy where she gets bored of me as a target and moves on, without me completely isolating myself from the wider group. my personal reading of her: the minute i got into a relationship, the day after i announced it was the day she started trying to make groupchats without me and leave me out. She has always wanted to have a man but has failed at her attempts and maybe shes jealous? she sees me travelling too, something she really wants and i guess her only way of control over my life is socially where she **loves to exlude me** My goals: 1. Make myself uninteresting for her to talk about 2. Quietly rebuild my reputation/social capital so her influence fades over time also, has anyone seen people like this actually get thier karma? im SO done with watching her talk about her friends, as well have targets (like me currently, but there have been others in the past for her, mostly her close friends)"}

De-escalation and getting out is probably best, but sometimes you can't. This may be bad advice, and it requires a few different skills (like reading social cues well, manipulation, wordplay/wordsmithing) - *also, this comment obviously doesn't address the two goals OP set out; maybe I'll try to address that separately lol* If she's NPD, know that she's keeping score and collecting ammunition. If you've not been doing the same, this is why you're behind the game. Learning people's weaknesses (what gets to them, what worries them, their anxieties, what they're self-conscious about) is important - you usually don't have to use it, but sometimes you run into someone out to get you, and you need to bury them. Sometimes a deep dive into someone's Facebook page is a good place to find things if you don't know much about them. Be nice to their face, laugh at their jokes - always gas up someone with NPD (because they can't help but live for it), but at the same time, tear at their insecurities. If they show signs of any financial insecurity, ask if they need help with their check, point out any wear in their clothes innocently, any crack you see; common gender insecurities work too (weight, height, baldness, etc), subtle digs, nothing overt, and always framed as if you are trying to HELP them (but in reality, you're trying to rip apart their ego, disassemble them). More specific things work well - because they're more likely to be seen as something that was noticed rather than an intentional insult. If you call them names, or anything like that, they WILL remember and keep track of how you've wronged them and get revenge. There are other techniques, like subtly \"forgetting\"/misspelling/mispronouncing their name every time you greet or talk to them, to make it seem like they're unimportant to you (and maybe unmemorable, insignificant). I had more of these but can't really remember them right now. Also if you can readily identify her personality faults, I've had luck in pointing them out to people, e. g. showing others how the subject keeps track of wrongs, engages in transactional relationships, and they can relate this to their own experiences if it's something they've never considered. Either way, good luck."}

(by couples or other groupings that make sense - probably the biggest you can muster the better) and have casual gatherings with each - whatever your standard fare is; movie night, going to restaurants, hanging out, having a picnic/bbq/potluck/friendsgiving, getting high, what have you. You'll need small coordination chats with each to set these get togethers up, which you can then use for occasional chatting after the fact (these conversations might be a tad hard to break out of the planning context). Eventually you can glom these circles together in the layout that makes sense, and reunite your friend group(s), still ex-her. If there are old mutuals that you no longer associate with now but are one hop away, you can potentially have your invitees invite them which might increase the chances of them wanting to go, breaking down those walls a bit.

The school asked me to help track them down, but they have no proper logs since personal Gmail accounts were used (and Google Classroom do not show IPs without having workplace). My plan: * Send a bait link to that burner email. * When opened, it runs browser fingerprinting and tries the location API. * If location access is granted (or the browser is misconfigured), I can pinpoint them. * If not, with the data gathered, I could match them on the school Wi-Fi by running the same script on its access portal. The challenge: I’m bad at crafting convincing bait emails. My current idea: Pretend to be a classmate offering a method to bypass teacher restrictions on Google Classroom, linking to the “tutorial.” Does this seem like the right approach given the context, or is there a better lure idea? EDIT: Ok, after reviewing the laws, this does not seem like the right approach since regulations here are strict (fortunately). I’ll focus on getting info from Google first, then use the school Wi-Fi data to cross-reference."}

When i gove a logical reasoning and/or literally showing the proof (hidden enemies in the bushes, blind shooting in the fog to where enemies are) he excepted with a little bit of annoyance. This keep happen even when we change the game to minecraft, conan and other non combative game. He asked me thing about the game, the mechanic and why i do what i do, I explained and he get annoyed. The accumulating of annoyance probably evolved into anger somewhere down the line and now whenever he ask i answer, he always except it with attitude or even straight up telling i was making up imaginary excuses. When question why bother asking if you dont believe me, he just ignored what I've just said and went back to ranting like I was the one spewing illogical nonsense And this behaviour is not just him, i find it on 2 other people in our friends group.

Many old political labels—left, right, liberal, conservative—no longer reflect the reality we face. Instead of clinging to outdated ideologies, we need a new framework—one that values participation, fairness, and shared responsibility. The Concordant Society is not a utopia or a perfect system. It’s a work in progress, a living agreement built on trust, accountability, and cooperation. This document offers a set of shared values and structural ideas for building a society where different voices can work together, conflict becomes dialogue, and no one is left behind. Article I – Core Principles 1. Multipolar Leadership Power should never be concentrated in a single person, party, or group. We believe in distributed leadership—where many voices, perspectives, and communities contribute to shaping decisions. 2. Built-In Feedback Loops Every decision-making process should allow for revision, challenge, and improvement. Policies must adapt as reality changes. Governance must be accountable and flexible. 3. The Right to Grow and Change People are not static. Everyone should have the right to evolve—personally, politically, spiritually. A society that respects change is a society that stays alive. Article II – Rights and Shared Responsibilities 1. Open Dialogue Every institution must have space for public conversation. People need safe, respectful forums to speak, listen, and learn. Silence must be respected. Speaking must be protected. 2. Protecting What Matters All systems should actively protect: The natural world The vulnerable and marginalized Personal memory and identity The right to privacy The right to opt out of systems Article III – Sacred Spaces 1. Personal Boundaries and Safe Zones Some spaces must remain outside of politics, economics, or control—whether they are personal, cultural, or symbolic. These spaces deserve protection and must never be forcibly entered or used. Closing Thoughts The Concordant Society is not a fixed system. It’s a starting point. A blueprint for societies that prioritize honesty, dialogue, and shared growth. We believe that: Leaders should bring people together, not drive them apart. The powerful must stop blaming the powerless. Real strength comes from empathy, humility, and collaboration. We’re not chasing perfection. We’re building connection. Not a utopia—just a society that works better, together. If this makes sense to you, you’re already part of it."}

No justifications in those situations, instead try and look up ways of countering false arguments or working with people that try to undermine your arguments instead of building their own. If the exact situation you’ve made as an example happens, point out clearly that you were just having a nice and open discussion and ask, what direction they’d want the conversation to continue further. If they start being an ass to you, just open the stage for them, ask them about their intentions and actions, point out their offensive approach and lack of any substantial meaning behind it without leaning too far into aggression or passive aggression.

Same with arguments, don’t end up on the wrong side trying to dismantle an actual argument by accident."}

But the truth is, **the most effective attack doesn’t involve computers… it involves people**. **Social engineering** is the art of manipulating someone into giving up information, granting access, or performing actions that compromise security. It doesn’t require complex exploits — just an understanding of how we think and behave. Famous examples: * An attacker pretending to be IT support to get an employee to grant them access to a system. * A “colleague” walking into an office claiming they forgot their ID badge. * An email imitating your bank, asking you to “verify your account.” Why does it work so well? Because it plays with our emotions: * **Trust:** if it looks legit, we don’t question it. * **Fear:** “Your account will be suspended if you don’t act now.” * **Curiosity:** “Check out this important document.” **How to protect yourself:** 1. Be suspicious of unexpected requests, even from “familiar” people. 2. Verify identities through a different channel than the one that initiated contact. 3. Never share passwords or sensitive information, not over the phone and not by email. 4. Educate yourself and others — awareness is the best defense. In a world where technology improves every day, hackers know that **the weakest link will always be the human**. The question is… how many of us are truly ready not to fall for it?"}

So you might as well go to the source :) Other than that, work on your speaking and articulation skills ( which is mostly an organizing your thoughts skills than anything else, really). I found Joseph Tzar s yt channel quite helpful with that. and last, but not least (and I am speaking from own experience here) - no matter how many books ou read or videos you watch - nothing will move the needle as much as putting yourself out there. But start with a safe environment, don t go into the wild. For example, this year I took the step and joined Toastmasters - because I was absolutely terrified of speaking in public (still am).

Here’s the eulogy I read at his funeral in Las Vegas. Rest in peace my friend. — Whenever I think about Kevin, I remember that infectious gleam in his eye when he was waiting for you to \"get it\" and his laugh when you did. I remember all the little magic tricks and decks of cards he had stashed everywhere, and the stories he had for everyone—and that he would always answer his phone, no matter what. And I cry knowing that I'll never see that mischievous smile again. But as I look back and remember his life, I know he's beaming down with that huge grin of his, seeing everyone gathered to remember him. What makes it bearable is seeing all of you - how we've come together today because of the wonderful memories he left us and the love we had for him. Kevin was my best friend and I loved him like a brother. We had a shared enthusiasm for all things tech starting way back in the 80's - radios, telephones, computers. But Kevin always wanted something more. He'd get some idea in his head, like hijacking cell phone radios, or telephone company control—and instead of worry about the risks involved, he just focused on the access he could already see. Then he'd enlist friends like Lew, Lenny, Terry, Dave or me to collaborate and help him figure out an issue, or to do something incredibly dangerous like putting on a Fedex shirt and dropping off \"emergency patch tapes\" to software companies. It was scary and not easy. We'd hit dead ends and had some really close calls with security guards and employees, and almost got caught many times, but we never did and always eventually got what we wanted. Because Kevin would never, never give up. (It was so much fun!) Afterwards we'd go to Canter's or Jerry's deli to celebrate \"adding to the collection\" of hacks, and talk about how it could be used. I can still hear him say \"Let's go eeeaattt!\" But it started getting really dangerous. Kevin got what he wanted, but kept wanting more. And he paid a heavy price. Alone, because he didn't talk or rat anyone else out. Prosecutors said he could launch nuclear missiles from a payphone and got him eight months in solitary confinement. He could have made a deal, but he did not talk. Did I mention he was a good friend? After he got out, he was a changed man. He had lost what seemed like a hundred pounds, and that gleam was gone from his eye and he was banned from touching computers for years. He would come over and hang out, but it wasn't the same. He was depressed. Then one day, he got a call from Steve Wozniak, the guy who made the Apple Computer. He wanted to meet! Boom, almost overnight the lights came back on, and he started pouring himself into writing his first book. Which he wrote at my office into the wee hours, and needed help to remember stuff, and we'd end up at Jerry's deli. Like old times. Woz, you have no idea how much you helped Kevin to get his Mojo back. It was so great to see! After that it started to snowball. We wrote and taught a hacking course together, did a radio show, and Kevin started writing more and more books and has left a lasting legacy. I spent time with Kevin and Kimberley in Germany and they were so happy. His loss is an unbearable void, and I don't know what I'm going to do the next time I pick up the phone and start dialing 1 805 341… and realize he's gone, way too early. Kimberly, may God watch over you and your baby and know that I love you and will do anything for you, and I'm certain that goes for everyone else in this room."}

Kevin signed up and heavily used it - he was on the phone all the time, it was insane. He would answer any call at any time. Anyway, AT&T eventually tried to \"upgrade\" him with a generous cap (not unlimited) and he always refused, I think even getting his attorney involved at one point.

The right questions are \"how do I improve my social skills and communications skills?\" and \"how do I improve my persuasion skills?\" Manipulation and deception ability is tightly correlated with those skills because those skills are the prerequisite skills and the foundational skills that excellent lying comes from.

Calm is critical in any engagement, how do you cultivate that actively when your body is full of adrenaline? Most people can regulate their breathing with practice, but can you control your emotion enough to reduce the dilation of your pupils and your heart rate? It’s a good skill to have. It’s important to note that other people / animals can literally smell your fear, so you have to control that internal emotional aspect. Can’t just fake smile your way through it. How to build and deliver lies is a fine topic to study and ponder.. I reckon acting and meditating have some practical application too."}

I also would look into any books on Amazon with the words “Dark Psychology” in the title because a lot of authors title their book that and that means detecting deception may be covered. Again, this is a bad approach because sales books and books on social engineering will teach you to lie better over time as a side effect.

I had been a victim of such scenario. I asked advice from people at work place that seemed genuine and experienced. They were also friendly with me. But all the advice they gave me set me back by 8 years as I stayed in that company for 8 years and unable to build skill and grow. So here is what I do now. 1) I need to be first clear in my mind what do I want and what is the direction I want to go. This sort of safeguards any sabotages coming my way. 2) I need to be clear in my mind about the authenticity of the opposite person. Study them first before approaching them for advice. Look for their past history and credentials and check their worthiness. 3) Ask deeper questions on their advice. Make them justify their own advice without them getting defensive. 4) Validate your goal with their advice. Validate their advice with reality. 5) Its just an advice. Not an order. I can still do something else. I am the one who controls. 6) Anybody gives free advice because its free. But Nobody actually helps without expecting something back. It could be as basic as feeling on top by giving advice. Think of what benefit they would reap if you followed their advice. Is that a win win situation ? 7) Its important to also trust your gut feeling. If you do follow your gut feeling and failed, you gain experience you need not blame others and it doesnt hurt much. But if you followed someone elses advice and failed then it hurts like a stab in the back. We become bitter. We start hating people. 8) Its good to have godfathers / mentors but not free advisories. 9) Most people dont know what they are doing. They are as clueless as you. 10) Always benchmark your self and keep validating the alignment of your actions to your goals. Irrespective of you acting as per advice or not. Sooner you can detect deviation, sooner you can course correct. These are not my advice. These are some things I think to myself and do. Remember \"YOU\" are the one who should be at the controls."}

When I joined half of this team was with one manager A and the other half with another manager B. I joined with a clear mandate to fix this team. I set on to do my work, and within weeks I noticed that manager A was \"hovering\" around still - giving feedback to my reportees without consulting me first, asking me to do certain things. As I quickly learnt this A is quite ambitiuous and has had quite the rise in the company before I joined. The way I saw it is he was positioning himself to be my superior (I already had a manager). In any case I saw this as quite overbearing and I shut it down straight away because I saw it as confusing my team and our partners - I have a clear mandate and I need to make sure everybody knows who to go to. I shut it down first by not engaging him directly. Eventually he got the hint and arranged a 1 to 1 where he asked me how he can help me. I told him thank you and if I needed his help I'll let him know. After this he disengaged for good, which has been good. I never really trusted him after this. Personally I think he's good but also the kind to comment and talk in every meeting to play the visibility crap with in my view unimportant input most of the time. However, he does have a lot of recognition in the company. So most recently, my manager was on holiday and we had a company wide task to do some work for each team. My manager was returning by monday, and he and I already had extensive discussions about this task. Manager A contacted me on chat on the last hour on Friday saying that because our manager was on holiday, he got \"tasked\" with covering for him by our skip. He then shot down a bunch of instructions that I've already covered with my manager - which left me confused. On Monday morning I told him it's all covered. Then I had a discussion with our shared manager where we didn't even bring this up. Manager A then arranged a meeting with me where he asked me \"whether the instructions he gave were clear\". I told I'm not sure why we're even discussing this since I'm already reporting to our shared manager about this task. He looked surprised, then he said oh that's fine then we don't need to worry about this. It was obviously a very tense meeting. After this he disengaged once again. To me it seems to me that he was too eager to do some bossing around, I have no idea what mandate he was given by the skip level but it seems like he took it to another level too quickly and did not even sync up with our shared manager. This whole episode happened two weeks ago and I am quite annoyed by it. I wanted to bring it up with my manager and posssibly my skip, but I'm not sure about the optics and how to do it without seeming overprotective. Any thoughts on how I handled this and how I should handle it in the future are welcome."}

If you talk in person or via phone call, you should write a follow up email that goes \"Thanks for the talk, we talked about this, I said I would do these things, you said you would do those things, if there's any thing you want to correct about these points, please respond to this email, I am trying to make sure this communication issue doesn't reappear\" or something. This follow up email is a very important habit to form, it's a paper trail and it's a great useful reference for yourself in the future, literally start doing it for every in person meeting you have with anyone, it can be as little as 3 sentences long. Frame this as a breakdown in communication, not an attack on manager A. You don't say you think he's doing anything wrong (don't say you don't think he's doing anything wrong), you just want to know what was supposed to be the outcome from the tasks laid out on Friday, because you were told XYZ by your supervisor and then ABC by manager A. Obviously, this is a mixup or things changed, and you are just trying to make sure all the tasks were completed correctly. You need to find out if he's actually being put in charge of you. If he is, then your supervisor isn't going to like you going over manager A's head because your supervisor picked him and instinctually won't like being second guessed. If he isn't, you want to communicate that he's trying to do this interference and it's making it harder to follow your supervisor's instructions. Which is why you start like this is something you are asking you manager to clarify about your own performance. If manager A was in charge, you aren't critiquing your supervisor's choices, just relaying that this situation didn't go smoothly and you are taking the initiative to improve this for the future. If manager A wasn't in charge, now your supervisor knows that that was happening and it was a problem that hurt productivity. VERY IMPORTANT TO CONSIDER: Manager A might have been placed in charge of you and you might just be being a salty bitch about it. You should consider that possibility. Especially if this a corpo enviroment, this shit happens all the time, you can make things really bad for yourself if manager A, who has been with the company longer than you, was in charge for a single day or was told to pass some instructions to you and you got your feelings hurt and start throwing accusations around. This is why you have to take this neutral, non-confrontational approach, to prevent yourself from becoming the insubordinate asshole in the eyes of the people who control your current job (until you get some in writing job offers, then go wild)."}

I really don’t understand why we don’t take full advantage of this opportunity.

So: How do you keep up your interactions? Especially when it comes to friendships, how do you balance staying in touch without seeming intrusive? Do you send one message a week? One a day? What do you usually write? Invitations to events? Casual check-ins? Requests for help? Do you dedicate some time every morning to catch up with your contacts? Do you ask about their plans for the day or invite them to join activities like a walk, pizza night, a barbecue, a card game, a hike, or a dog walk?"}

Sometimes that may lead somewhere, but, for instance, when I get birthday texts from people who otherwise never engage it just feels a bit cold and automated. Those friendships grow nowhere. I think half of this mystery is simply because we’re immersed in extended bond-building hours as children sharing the same path, school, and parallel growth. Normal adult life naturally doesn’t provide that setup to build most of our deeper bonds as adults. By having children later we may experience more years of post-childhood social immersion as we take different, regularly changing paths without family yet comprising our social bonds. My grandfather died 30 years ago, wise and thoughtful his whole life and known for his friendships at every stage and with his students of many generations as a professor. In his last years he said one that thing he found remained true was that his closest friendships were still those he had known the longest, since childhood and adolescence. Some of them he only spoke to once a year or two, others he saw every week, and the joy was always in just sharing the incidental humor of daily life, not plumbing intense emotions. And when intense circumstances came through it was this continuum of decades of day-to-day humor and presence that allowed them to meet on those deep levels, and gave them the reassurance to endure. It’s not monumental honorings of brotherhood (which are fine), but small confirmations of affection, brief sympathy for our troubles, acceptance despite our minor misdeeds, and the practice and promise of a joke every few sentences. Life is absurd. The payoffs are never grand. There are really only small things, small steps and achievements, and friendships are only built of small moments. I get that we feel we’re missing out on some big things, I’m just not sure if there really are big things. We live and can only nourish imperfectly, in minutes. When someone reminds you in the smallest ways that you deserve to laugh through most of those minutes, you have a friend."}

And yeah, I worry about being annoying if I just randomly message someone. It’s like there’s this invisible wall: we *could* reach out, but something always stops us. For me, it’s usually this mix of awkwardness and fear of rejection. Like, what if they don’t reply? Or what if I come off as desperate? So I end up not saying anything, and then the silence just grows. When I do try to keep in touch, I usually just send a quick message—something like “Hey, how’s life?” or “Saw this and thought of you.” Sometimes it leads to a real conversation, sometimes it’s just a like or a thumbs up and that’s it. It feels kind of empty sometimes, but it’s better than nothing. Inviting people to stuff is even harder. I always feel like I’m imposing, or that nobody will actually want to come. But every once in a while, I just go for it—“Pizza night at my place, you in?” Most people don’t show, but the ones who do, those are the real ones. I don’t have a system or a schedule. I just try to reach out when I’m thinking about someone, even if it’s been months. It’s messy and inconsistent, but honestly, that’s life. I wish it was easier, but I guess everyone’s just trying to figure it out. If you’ve cracked the code, let me know. Because I’m still working on it."}

Not a book, but I recommend doing Chris Hadnagy's online Information Elicitation course. I've been doing it and its the best social skills course, communication skills course, or social engineering course built for beginners than any book I have ever read. [ Do all the assignments and take good notes. Listen to each chapter multiple times. Its gonna be difficult but if you practice you'll get MUCH better at social engineering. You need to PRACTICE A LOT. I am about to listen to chapter 3 for the fourth time tomorrow and takes even better notes to practice. Then I'm gonna redo the assignment for chapter 2 even tho I already aced it to implement what I have learned in chapter 3 in the context of chapter 2. I am not gonna turn the assignment in a second time but I'm literally just doing it for practice. That's how you gotta be. SOCIALIZE OFTEN AND INTERACT WITH HUMANS! BEST COMPLEMENT TO GO WITH THIS COURSE! Then once you've taken several months to really reinforce the skills from that course and practice and get good at it, continue to practice in your daily life. Get better at it. While your doing that, if you want to know hacking too, do Hack the Box Academy. They have InfoSec Foundations path if you don't know enough about how stuff works to learn to hack. Complete the InfoSec Foundations Path. Then pick CPTS or CBBH as a next step and go from there. But make sure to have multiple interests. Don't be the tech savant. Find different things you like. It could be art, music, TV, gaming, sports, board games, martial arts, rock climbing, whatever. Find things you genuinely enjoy that are normal things for people to talk about. Learn about that stuff to. It will help you when doing SE for hacking, trust me. You'll see why when you do the course. As for actual books, here's the famous combination of books for SE applied to hacking: *Social Engineering: The Science of Human Hacking* by Chris Hadnagy *The Art of Deception* by Kevin Mitnick *The Art of Intrusion* by Kevin Mitnick If you are very good at the skills taught in the online elicitation course tho, you may benefit more from getting an SE pentesting course or book that focuses on technological hacking skills and learning from that. Once you have the people skills side of social engineering AND the technological hacking skills, combining them is easy. Its getting at both of those skills separately that's difficult. Chris Hadnagy has another course that is an in-person social engineering penetration testing course for a different SE certification, but it is thousands of dollars. More if you want to take the CESE exam. I think that is difficult to get paid for. But his elicitation course with the certification that goes with it is under $300, even with the certificate of completion. So I highly recommend doing the elicitation course. If you have an employer pay for CESE, its probably worth it for SE skills. If not, you may be able to get the government to pay for it if you have a disability. But if you don't want to fly to Florida at a scheduled time, the elicitation course is probably a more practical option. For me, I think it works better to do his online elicitation course and then get good at that first. Then afterwards, I plan on reading those three books or doing an online social engineering penetration testing course of some kind and maybe reading at least two of those three books. I would say some version of that is probably ok. Also, in case you hear people talk about how they don't like this thing Chris Hadnagy did last year, I don't know if he did that or not. I do know he objectively has the best training. People do Jordan Belfort's sales training because of how good it is and I don't see anyone talking about how they don't support him or recommending you not do the training. Should be the same thing for Hadnagy. If you have autism and struggle socially or have some sort of social skills problems but are highly intelligent, his information elicitation course is way better than any social skills training you can get. Sure, other social skills trainings are designed with autism in mind, but they are designed for someone lower functioning. The reason is Chris's course is designed to be accessible to normal introverts and nerds as well as sales people or anyone who wants to improve their social skills or does anything to interact with humans. It teaches persuasion applied to elicitation, so you have a safe way to practice. The course covers a ton of persuasion topics, but it also does a very good job of getting you the practical skills behind those topics if you practice often. It also does a fabulous job of improving your social and communications skills IN ADDITION to getting you MUCH better social engineering skills than you probably had before you started the course. Let me put it that way. Make sense?"}

Most often it means that you will feel forced to give an excuse when you reject them, or a long winded not-rejection, when really you meant to reject them. That's one part of how they manipulate, they make people never close the door completely, always leave an opening. You must learn to leave no opening. Don't excuse. Don't explain. Answer with one word sentences. Or even better, with questions, to send the ball back. You will be met with pressure, with attempts of blame, of ridicule, but you must not waiver. Turn every interaction down. You will feel hostile, but it is necessary to rebuild your boundaries. Most annoying thing about this is that if you are successful, he will most likely just leave you be, and go bother someone else, you will not even get the satisfying feeling of retribution or anything, so you should make sure your motivation for learning this is simply to be left alone by him. However it will help you to deal with all these kinds of people in life, of you get good at simply shutting them down, never give anyone anything extra, unless you really feel like it yourself, never because you are pressured into it. Your attention, your empathy, your love, those are your most precious possessions, and you shall give them only to those you want to.

That sounds bad. Yeah, you need help that I'm unsure I can provide. It sounds like what you really need is help from someone you can trust offline. You need to find a family member or maybe a friend, and explain to them, in detail, what is going on. Make sure to explain the part that involves Reddit moderators being in on it due to government backed fraud. This is important. Just explaining what is happening is unlikely to mean anything new to whatever group or entity is following you (they, after all, would likely have a better understanding of what's happening than you do), so even if the person is connected, it shouldn't change anything versus what they'd already do. What is important is to establish a support group with people you know offline that can get you help. There is an online community that I know of that could help you feel better, but it is likely not as good as getting IRL help. If you _really_ need it, I can share, but I highly recommend not going this route for various reasons. It is, at best, what I consider in my own words to be \"hollow support.\""}

What you wrote earlier made it sound like you had a _different_ problem. I'm pretty sure politics don't have anything to do with this; most subreddits have rules, both written and unwritten, to not track down people. For more information on why this is, Google the phrase \"We did it, Reddit!\" for an example of why. If memory serves me right, it might even be against the Reddit EULA. I'm not sure if this counts as doxxing, but I know doxxing is explicitly against the EULA. I guess I can give general advice still. Let's start with easiest: if you haven't already, check with the HS (High School, I'm guessing) If there's been a FERPA violation, they might be somewhat liable as well. Again: if you haven't already, talk with a lawyer. The school might become more willing to talk when the lawyers come into the picture. IANAL. Does this person already have a criminal record? Maybe checking for that will yield something. Either way, if you really want to find this person, you're going to likely have to fork out some money to hire a lawyer, use one of the people finder services that others have suggested, or hire a private investigator. ~~Edit: I guess you could also try r/RBI. They may forward you to another sub, though.~~ Edit 2: Don't try RBI. Their rules explicitly say \"help me find this person\" posts are banned."}

Beyond just the evident advice read books, do research or remain in the status quo comments previously presented here, I would like to add some tangible notes of success from someone who has achieved the opposite of your goal: going from rather excessively cocky to reflective and more reserved. 1. Your goal is rather difficult, unclear, and somewhat counterproductive. \"Becoming a badass\" usually comes from a series of intelligent, deliberate, and calculated decisions that bring you toward a certain goal. \"Not giving a fuck\", though semi-analogous to \"immune to excessive discouraging social pressure\" in the modern day, is not the end-all-be-all solution to the pursuit of esteem you think it is. Instead of telling you that you just don't have to care what other people think, I'm here to tell you that you have to power to decide what opinions and perspectives you will heed and value. For instance, the average naysayer would tell you not to take space and attempt to humiliate you into invisibility, whereas anyone supportive of a worthy cause or people you represent will admire and encourage your presence. Not all criticism is equal, choose the nutrition of your soul and well-being wisely. 2. Self-esteem is a form of discipline: the ability to leave your comfort zone and act even when you do not want to. Taking risks, being in public, or doing things beyond your usual routine is uncomfortable, but it is necessary and fulfilling. Think of confidence, and most other human qualities, as muscles that need to be practiced and strengthened. You need to visualize yourself doing uncomfortable things and go through with them, focus on how you'll feel when the task is accomplished, now what you feel in anticipation. 3. Recognize your strength and arm yourself with knowledge and kindness, towards yourself and those around you. The most confident people are the ones able to give themselves and those around them more grace. Do you remember what the most embarrassing thing your colleague/classmate did? Most likely not, and if you do, there is a huge chance you find in other people something you are also insecure/conscious about. 4. Lastly, change is not linear. You will oftentimes revert to old habits or feel as though you are not progressing, and wonder if you're able to channel the consistency needed for change. Making the effort to continue despite feeling that such things is the true test of change. Good luck!"}

Replace it with \"verification\" \"It's not about the destination. It's not even about the journey. It's about HOW we do WHAT we do ON that journey. And with who\""}

I figured I was more entertained doing my own thing around people in social situations and was smarter than most professionally, and people followed. If they didn’t and I got bored by myself, I’d go spend long enough to get bored again not doing my own thing I’ve seen people get so angry at the world the end up not giving a fuk and doing what they want, but I wouldn’t recommend this. You can’t be angry and happy with life Some people naturally don’t give a fuk and do what they want.

Don’t be the “I don’t give a fuck” guy. Obviously, you shouldn’t care what everyone thinks about you. But you also should be ethical and sensitive of others. I recommend you improve your social skills. Find meetups in your area for your favorite interests or hobbies and go often. Here’s a good online course for improving your skills: I would do the full, certification included version of the course. Also, Improv classes aren’t for me but some people benefit from them if you are a comedian type. If you are a sales type do sales training. But put yourself out there. The only way to build confidence around others is to socialize. Also, be yourself. Don focus on “becoming a badass.” That’s the worst possible goal. Instead find an interest or skill you want to learn and set a goal within that interest. So “becoming better at boxing” or “learning to hack computers” is a better goal than “becoming a badass.” Find actionable, specific goals to learn tho. So an even better goal than “becoming good at boxing” would be “starting training at a boxing gym” and then maybe “getting good enough to spar” or “lose 5lbs.” Or in terms of computer hacking, start with “getting through infosec foundations pathway on hack the box” rather than just “learn IT so I can hack.” Take each goal one step at a time. Once you get past infosec foundations, better next step is “completing CBBH path” or “completing CPTS” and eventually these short term goals add up and you become a hacker or a fighter over time. Make sense? See where I’m going with this?"}

The problem is that lower pay & the systematic manipulation of it creates serious real-world problems that the PIs (primary investigators in the experiment) are not aware of & don't care about. I wrote a list of notable unethical studies in USA history to date and the current variations of it (that I experienced). The patterns & parallels are crystal clear. Currently being blocked from posting it here but you can msg me for more info. As for the time frame of the experiments being run, they can go on for generations. This is what you call longitudinal design. And of course the cohort needs to be large. That's how you obtain statistical signficance. As for \"unwittingly participating in them\"--of course deception needs to be enforced. You can't have participant bias, otherwise the data is truly garbage. Can you ask your close relative how they handled the subjects were experienced adverse impact as a research of experimental manipulations? What reparations were provided?"}

Of course I'd use this as a way to gain more info on the situation. Is that not a common sense thing to do? Are you falling victim to the Rosenhan Effect? FYI--if you are a subject of a longitudinal experiment, then you actually are part of an ongoing experiment. By definition. Do you understand this concept or no? Let me know if you'd like me to explain. Happy to help. You know those clinical trials where people are in programs, or go through treatments, or take any meds, etc.? That's a longitudinal experiment. Some of them can last for decades. You know those nature vs nurture, twin studies, etc.? Those are also longitudinal experiments. So those ppl are definitely subjects & they're definitely being monitored, bc they're the basis for someone's research/job/livelihood, etc. The thing is that I did not signup for the bizarre and adverse impact manipulations that I have experienced. (These relate to pay issues, social engineering malicious incidents, responses to harassment, etc.). So I am speaking out against that--Unethical treatment in experiments where the subjects had no consent or information. This is not the first time something like this has happened in the history of official experimentation. Check this out & I can explain the parallels in between what I'm experiencing: Pygmalion in the Classroom / Rosenthal & Jacobson study, The Stanford Prison Experiment, The Milgram Obedience Experiment, Confirmation Bias & Rumor Generation Studies/Allport & Postman, Buckner; Asch, The \"Monster Study\", Little Albert Study, The Rosenhan experiment. FYI--I do have a formal edu background in experimental research. So I know exactly how manipulations would be administered, research trends, who's funding what, etc. Although, you don't need a Piled Higher & Deeper degree to understand this. If you're insightful & observant, you'll figure it out. My issue is that I was/am being wrongfully blacklisted bc apparently the original PIs needed a scapegoat and I didn't play along and \"act stupid\" like I was supposed to. I also didn't get paid at all to appear as retardedly incompetent as they needed me to me. That is the problem. I don't have any desire to antagonize anyone. Hell, why the fck would I do that? I didn't do anything wrong to begin with. But I was definitely setup & there was some deliberately falsified info that was used to create adverse impact. So being severely backdoored & wrongfully blacklisted, the only rational thing to do is get what was stolen from you in the first place--plus the compound interest on it-- & hold shady perpetrators accountable."}

The tickets went on sale and I had an early access thing to get better seats before the public so I offered just to front them right now and they could pay me back when they can. The event is July 2nd I figured they’d have some time. I wouldn’t be so concerned or irritated, but him and his wife are both spending money on things. She got her hair done, he’s going to the casino and golf at a course that cost 100$. I guess i said just pay me back before the event, so it would be wrong for me to say something? But I haven’t seen a dollar for their tickets or anything. I’m just afraid it will come to it being time to go and they hadn’t paid. I know you shouldn’t lend money you can’t afford to lose and ill be fine with out it, I just more upset that they said they’d go and pay me back and they could have just said no. I don’t want to ruin a relationship over it. What would you or should I do? Should I just sell the tickets and hope to make my money back so I’m not fully screwed or wait for them to try and pay ?

On friend meetups or trips she often gets him to drive her around although her house is obviously inconvenient for him, and thats just an example off the top of my head. Now the girl doesnt seem to want to be associated with him for some reason, even though its pretty obvious hes into her. Hes done some of he rprojects for her, bought some gifts for her, however she has reactions when we call her his partner or girlfriend. Everyone else in the class seems to either not notice or is ignoring this aside from my closest friend, where weve talked about this before. And weve even confronted her about this, and she claims that they arent dating or anything when the boy has clearly invested energy and time into her. Now were almost graduating and she seems to not have changed. I mainly hope for the better for the guy, but the girl however, has nothing going with her other than her looks, and her face funnily enough is her ugliest part in my opinion."}

When you’re not, most social techniques just feel like you’re patching over something deeper. Once I started digging into why I felt uncomfortable, what beliefs or insecurities were sitting underneath, things got easier. Techniques can still help, but mostly as tools to reveal where you’re stuck, not as permanent fixes. If you can get to the core early, everything else becomes way more natural. Spend more time learning about yourself is my only advice. The result is genuine. You can master all the public speaking or social tricks and still not come off as genuine. It really depends on what you’re trying to achieve. If you want real connection, start with knowing yourself first."}

Don't listen to people telling you not to learn persuasion just because \"it's manipulation.\" All communications are persuasion. Its a part of socializing. By those people's logic, all communication is manipulation and therefore all social skills are manipulation. The course improves your social skills and takes you from basic, to high intermediate or advanced level. Or at least, more advanced then other social skills training will. At least this holds true if you actually do the course in order, take notes, socialize often to practice, and master each chapter's material before moving to the next. The other options are the take Improv classes or get sales training. Either of those can help too. They work for some people but not others. Also, read books on psychology. Especially social psychology. Read sales books. Learn how people think. It will really help you."}

The core misconception about manipulation is that it's an active, planned, conscious act on the part of the manipulator. Granted, people who tend to be manipulative often have a strong predisposition for emotional and introspective intelligence, which helps them become aware of this tendency over time. But the engine driving these individuals is subconscious, not conscious. They feel an urge or a need to say or do something outside of their usual behavior because they perceive that the social environment requires that specific input, or that they themselves could benefit from it. In this process, both the initial perception and the decision of what to say or do are subconscious. To reiterate, over time, these individuals can become more and more aware of this manipulative engine, but its origin is not conscious at all. Someone who tries to manipulate actively and consciously often comes across as unnatural to anyone with at least average emotional intelligence. You can spot fake behavior right away. Subconscious execution, on the other hand, appears far more natural and is therefore much more effective. Here are a few examples: * **Playing the victim:** This is a manipulative technique that can be highly effective when done well. People rarely do it on purpose (meaning, they didn't plan it, but rather felt a sudden need to do so). When done deliberately, it comes across as highly unnatural and can backfire, achieving the opposite of the desired effect. * **The silent treatment:** After an argument, some people tend to pull away and become cold toward the other person, even if deep down they know they still want to be close. This happens because they feel the need to apply the \"stick\" in the \"carrot and stick\" approach. After giving too many \"carrots,\" they feel a need to use the \"stick\" to rebalance the dynamic and avoid being taken for granted, preventing the other person from exploiting the rosy situation you've fed them until that point. * **Agreeing when you don't mean it:** We often agree with someone just to move past a discussion and make them feel heard, even if we don't agree at all. I personally forced myself to top doing this because it suppresses my own personality in the dynamic. I don't like to let someone think I believe something I don't, just to end an argument (exception made for cases where I certainly need to make them believe I think something specific). Instead, I'll point out that the discussion isn't productive and that I'm mature enough not to lose my attention over a simple disagreement. * **Being sad for others:** I couldn't care less. I don't feel a lump in my throat because your childhood story truly moved me, but rather to make you feel more connected to me and to show you what seems like genuine empathy. You can't just summon a lump in your throat at will; it's the subconscious pulling the right strings to help me be more effective in that dynamic. * **A fleeting physical touch:** I certainly didn't plan to place a hand on the small of your back or your hip. I just felt the right energy in that moment, and my subconscious improvised a very powerful gesture that potentially deepened the relationship, making it more intimate. * **Embarrassment from a compliment:** I might think I deserve far more than one compliment, but my subconscious wants to help me appear humble about that success to shield myself from potential future expectations. If I seem too confident and vain, I won't be allowed to fail in the future, or I'll disappoint the high expectations they've unfairly placed on me. * **Exploiting cognitive biases:** I felt the need to frame an argument carefully so it would be more persuasive and gloss over any logical flaws. * **etc...** (Feel free to mention other examples of subconscious manipulation in the comments, I'm truly curious). An interesting final point I'd like to make is that this engine doesn't just work on other people - it works on ourselves, too. If you engage in some deep introspection, you might realize how you've overcome many things thanks to incredibly powerful self-manipulation. At that depth, the engine is capable of triggering very strong placebo effects. Some final conclusion - these techniques are not something you will learn by reading a book. Most people with such natural manipulative tendencies were born with predisposition to deep understanding of people's emotional behavious; social dynamics are driven by emotions. You can of course still develop your engine by observing a lot of interesting social dynamics."}

A fleeting physical touch is manipulative? Lol. Wait until you find out what therapists are trying to do to you in their office, with that logic, they’re all narcissists. I think that most behaviours humans do socially are trying to signal to another about who we are and simultaneously influence the relationship in some way. I really think the difference between influence and manipulation is the negative connotation and intention (whether it’s subconscious or not). A therapist might influence you to think differently about a situation and yourself, but this is something that benefits the patient, it’s not used for their own gain. In fact, one might argue a therapist who is very good at influencing you positively would be sacrificing a lot of potential money. If you are feeling better, you’ll probably stop paying for therapy. I think manipulation is about intention, it’s usually influencing someone in a way that serves you, and usually harms the person in some way. I’ll use the therapist again, this time to talk about manipulation. If a therapist was steering a patient to think differently about something that would benefit the therapist and harm the client, this would be manipulative. Some have done this to exploit a patient and abuse them sexually for example, that’s certainly manipulation. I think your logic has a lot of biases and assumptions that people feel the same as you do, especially that no one actually cares for others sad stories. It honestly sounds a bit jaded and I hope you can see the good in people one day."}

A personal example that fits into your point: I “manipulate” myself all the time by reframing my thoughts. When I catch unproductive thinking, I reframe it to steer my behavior in a better direction. Over time, that process feels more natural and automatic, like my subconscious picks up the pattern and starts doing it on its own. Same engine, just pointed inward. I also see how some people can react strongly to certain examples like “playing the victim.” It’s a loaded term because genuine suffering exists, but I think your point is more about how sometimes - often without realizing it - people might express vulnerability in ways that also serve a social or relational purpose. That doesn’t mean the emotions aren’t real, it just shows how layered and automatic some of our behaviors can be. If anything, adding the ethical layer could strengthen your view even more for people who struggle with the word “manipulation.” The behavior itself is neutral, it’s the intention and outcome that determine whether it’s healthy, harmful, or simply necessary in certain social dynamics. Understanding that can help people recognize when they’re using these subconscious processes constructively vs. destructively. Great, very balanced perspective!"}

Or it could be that you want to appear as though you deeply relate to bond with them. Neither of those things are manipulation, that’s politeness and social bonding. If anything it is ego based, sure. Ego isn’t inherently harmful though, we need a little ego to survive. An example of a dark manipulative behaviour would be if someone expressed sadness, then you pretended to be emotional and lied that you went through something similar, but your intent is so you could get closer to someone you perceive as weak and easy to exploit later on. Intention is everything, and they can only vary slightly with very different outcomes. Providing reassurance through touch or expressing sadness can be real forms of empathy to those who have a normal to high degree of it. If that is something you do not possess and are masking, that may just be that you have a low amount of empathy and assume others are the same. That’s fine if so, as long as you are able to not use dark manipulative tactics for your own benefit. Now someone can lack the ability to be cognisant that their intentions are dark and abnormal, some people with ASPD may think that everyone is like them underneath. For someone without empathy, it is hard to imagine what they do not possess. It would be like trying to hear and imagine a frequency too high for your ears to perceive. Other people may talk about it but you can’t understand it and might not believe them. Therapy is great for building self awareness and reflective skills. There are many types of therapy for the many different types of people. To relegate the entire concept as a scam is bizarre when you have never done it. It honestly gives me the impression there are some things inside of you that you are scared to explore. Essentially though it comes down to semantics, influence and manipulation are different due to their intention. If you want to understand if something is manipulative, you need to understand if the covert action most likely has an intention to harm someone for the manipulators benefit."}

The intention is what can be manipulative. I have heard narcissists online talk about causing harm to make their girlfriend cry so they can ascertain when she’s crying to manipulate them. The irony is laughable. It shows how someone’s understanding of other’s behaviour is limited by their own internal experience. They are acting under the assumption that normal emotional reactions are used to manipulate, as that is something they do. For me, I cannot cry on command, I truly have to feel overwhelmed/fearful/sad to do so. So because of my own limited understanding based on my internal experience, I never assume an emotional reaction like crying is used to manipulate someone. Even if I suspect someone may have manipulative intentions, I cannot imagine that they would cry on command, but rather that they are having a real emotional expression whilst simultaneously having an exploitative intent."}

Although the straight definition is to control or influence someone, how often do you hear someone say “my therapist manipulated me into curing my mental illness.” I only ever hear or read about social manipulation being used in a negative context, and as language is fluid and changes with the way people use it over time, I argue that it does have a negative context specifically. Why do semantics matter? You probably already care about semantics if you’re also autistic haha, but I think in this context it’s vital. Weighted words that have power to their use require consideration. An example of this is the term gaslighting. Most people learnt online that this is a very, very bad thing. The use of this word evokes a negative emotion in many people, shaping the way they view a person being accused of it or a narrative they’re being told. This is particularly problematic when you consider how many people misuse gaslighting when they really mean “someone disagreed with me”. Now as language is a fluid thing, the meaning of gaslighting could change over time to mean someone disagreeing, but in the meantime it is incredibly harmful to our narratives and to others to misuse a loaded and emotive term such as gaslighting. So by my logic I consider the use of a word by: it’s original definition + the way it is commonly used & how long it may have been used that way + the impression/emotion most people get from that word. Think about the different impressions and emotions that are evoked from these two statements. “Kelcamer is a manipulative person.” “Kelcamer is an influential person.” Because language isn’t a fixed thing, the common use matters as it influences the way we experience a narrative. There’s a reason we call content creators influencers and not manipulators—it would be pretty bad PR."}

That number was tied to everything: my Google account, my iCloud, my photos, emails… everything. I’ve tried and tried to work with Verizon and explained the situation multiple times, but they didn’t help until it was too late. They gave the number away. I actually found the person who has it now, and I messaged her begging for help not trying to harass her or anything , just trying to explain that I only need the number temporarily to recover my accounts. She said she’d help… and then blocked me. I get that people are cautious these days, but I offered to FaceTime or video call during the whole thing just to prove I’m not trying to scam her or access anything that’s not mine. I just want back into my own accounts. That Google account has years of memories, work, personal stuff and even proof that I needed for a case against my ex. it’s honestly crushing to feel like it’s just gone.

I particularly enjoy using it after someone's given an entire pitch or hook down the line and has finally run out of steam. Legit callers will 99% immediately identify themselves. Spammers and scammers will have about a 70-80% chance of rushing through giving a (fake) name and business, and the others will try to steamroll past that. In either case, not identifying themselves just makes me repeat the question, *absolutely regardless* of anything they've tried to hammer down the phoneline in the meantime. No, I don't care what you opened with, or what question you're trying to get me to answer or hook me into a conversation with, that's not what I asked. If someone calls me, that's taking up my attention, my time, and my incoming line. Either they justify doing that (by quickly convincing me they're someone I am OK with taking those things from me), or their day is about to get unprofitable, personally uncomfortable, and/or surreal. I still remember the overseas scammer who ended up screaming they were going to send the Incredible Hulk to kill me, before slamming down the phone. Good times."}

Con artists aren't exactly new but in the last two decades or so, these individual and operations have gotten completely out of control. And it's been infuriating me. So let's say, hypothetically of course, that I wanted to make these people pay, both literally or figuratively, in order to get justice for victims (by giving out the proceeds to properly vetted, for obvious reasons, victims who'd most likely never see a dime recovere)? Drawing vengeful ones out would be a welcome complication as well (in order to \"take them off the board\", preferably via law enforcement though justifiable use of self defense isn't to be ruled out) Let's say in this hypothetical that the individuals involved have the sociopolitical motivation as well as as well as the means, skills, network and temperament/inclination to both follow through with the scheme as well as to deal with them, one way or another, to deal with any who come after them? To be clear, I'm asking because I'm planning a novel, as to actually be able to pull this off is somewhat fantastical as well as illegal. Thing is I have Level one (high functioning) autism and the concepts behind social engineering can be a bit hard to grasp considering how I'm personally wired. But it does seem like a really good hook for story. My hope is that if successful maybe it could further increase awareness and demand for government to become far more aggressive and proactive in going after these people as well as increasing legislation, regulations and capabilities aimed at better protecting people, apprehension and putting greater pressure on complacent and complicit foreign governments to cooperate. 'Cuz right now this problem is wildly out of control, getting worse and making a lot of very evil people at home and abroad very rich off. All from a crime that is essentially an epidemic of robbery by deception. Governments would be scrambling wildly to combat if it was being done in person by force or burglary. So any tips on the tactics that my protagonists could use (as well as the ones used by criminals that many people may not be aware are being used on them all the time) to make this a better and more compelling story? I really think it would help make for a more realistic and engaging plot than reliance on cliched and unrealistic tech packing Hollywood style super hackers and make it a more gritty, personal and realistic."}

I'm not an expert myself but I do know that social engineering can require a lot of research and keeping track of almost every element from the characters traits to conversation threads started in-between. It is extremely difficult however due to the high risk of slipping up and having to do stuff that would make anybody feel uncomfortable. In relation to your answer. A lot of \"con\" artists out there are just hucksters and fakes, especially those on Telegram. The modern day \"con\" artist uses the word \"bro\" too much and sound very European, they never bother to put in effort as well; it always boils down to \"con\" artists promising you something that sounds incredibly unrealistic like say... they want to give you a cut of the profits in exchange for using your CashApp account to send money on their behalf or in the most common case, pretending to be Elon Musk using AI deepfakes to scam people out of money. The most hilarious \"cons\" I've encountered involve scammers pretending to be Michael Jackson who died in 2009, yes this is real. I've seldom see social engineering used these days but that's just me. I do think that the concept of social engineering can be used in the novel to create a deep story with deep characters. I'm going to pitch one and say that your protagonist is currently working on social engineering a group of antagonists who have skin in the game and have never been caught. The protagonist is doing this because he felt first hand what had happened when nobody believed him and his life fell apart with the antagonists being responsible for the damage. The leader of the group notices what the protagonist is doing and is fearful of everything he was worked for being found out and so decides to go against the protagonist. I would heavily lean into social influence as well to make the novel feel more like a thriller. The best novels are the ones that really dig deep into the characters and settings. Good luck on your novel."}

Most of us don't have that syndrome of disabilities. Most of the people you meet who are diagnosable on the autism spectrum, myself included, you'd likely never know it. For one, we're as varied as neurotypical folks in our abilities and weakness, just more profoundly.

I just have some social deficits that make it hard to wrap my head around the nuts and bolts of doing it even though I understand the concept. For example, I'm made physically and mentally uncomfortable by lying. Therefore the act of manipulating people is nearly impossible for me to bear because, like many autistic people, not violating my own moral and ethical beliefs (which may vary just like NTs) is something my brain hardwired to do.

I noticed it quite some time ago and sometimes feel the need to say something, but when I do, it's met with anger. I really don't want to damage our relationship, so is it a case of accept the situation and not voice my opinion on his behaviour, or say something and risk an argument? As a backstory to this, my dad was quite abusive to him (and myself) when we were young. He was frequently insulted by my dad and never really nurtured by him. I understand, or at least feel that I do, why he's like this, but it's still a struggle to accommodate his need to be domineering."}

I like to go into establishments and talk to the employees, then use what I learn from one employee to connect with other employees and learn things they don't tell everyone. Who is friends with who, who is the nice one that gives drunkies rides, who is the least liked coworker, which of the customers are regulars. You can use this kind of info to strategically build social connections that help you later. In one night at a new bar, I can get on a first name basis with lots of employees and sometimes it results in free drinks.

Well here is my personal take and a few pyschological theories to explore.. I used to work in a university that has a human simulation education program. I spent thousands of hours observing, designing, and participating in staged interactions designed to improve communication. Think: improv meets real-life situations you get to practice. What I learned is this: it is not just what people *say* about themselves that is revealing. It is *how* they say it, what role they cast themselves in when telling a story, and how they show up in small, everyday moments. One day, outside of work, a moment stuck with me. I was at a little kids’ soccer game. One of the moms, whom I had never met, was standing nearby. Her kids were on the field, and the coach was doing an amazing job wrangling the chaos into drills that actually taught the kids something. At the end of the practice, I turned to the mom and said, “You found a great program. This coach is incredible with them.” She did not smile. Did not nod. Did not even say thank you. Instead, she let out a big sigh, and said, “These monsters just terrorize me all day.” Her body language slumped. Her tone flat. Her kids well within earshot. That moment told me more about her inner state than any deep conversation could. She dismissed the compliment. She redirected it with stress. And in doing so, she cast herself as the exhausted, overwhelmed protagonist in her own life story. This is not about judging her. It is about observing patterns. After years of studying human behavior, I have found that the roles people assign themselves, how they deflect connection, and the way they narrate their own lives gives you a remarkably clear view into their internal world. From a psychological standpoint, this connects with concepts like self-schema theory, which explains how people construct stories about themselves that shape their perception of reality. It also aligns with narrative identity theory, which suggests our sense of self is formed by the internal stories we tell. And finally, attribution theory (the way people explain events or behaviors, often to protect their ego) can reveal how they view both themselves and others. If you know what to look for, everyday conversations are like X-rays."}

Be kind and helpful to people when you see the opportunity. Give without expecting anything in return. How can you leave positive changes in your building? Focus inward for a bit. Who are you? What motivates you? What would you like to accomplish over this next year? Being shunned hurts like hell. Find a healthy way to process and express those feelings without hurting yourself or anyone else. Exercise is a great outlet. Seek out new opportunities with different people. Neediness is a huge turnoff so putting your energy elsewhere has multiple benefits: you can distract yourself from the hurt, you are being a different person than what they heard about, and being less needy makes you more attractive and more compelling. You’re not being the person who was badmouthed so that dissonance creates curiosity. It’s also good for you because you can care less and distance yourself from other people’s opinions. Give all of them time and space. This will also create space for new people to come into your life."}

If I were in high school my English teachers would have a conniption. You see it is a lie. This article is actually about tactics commonly abused by narcissists in conversations, often the tactics themselves are used by all sorts of communicators in many different contexts. Tactics or patterns themselves aren’t usually narcissistic, it’s how they’re applied. No behaviour without context is inherently narcissistic. And like Zeno’s paradox, and obscenity, we know it when see it but damned if we can define the point at which it occurs. The general guideline is that if behaviours are used repetitively and strategically to evade accountability, protect ego, or control narrative and perception and this is done at the cost of another persons clarity, autonomy, or emotional balance - then the behaviour is being utilized in a narcissistic way. The goal of this article is to help you recognize these behaviours or patterns, provide some thoughts on distinguishing whether they are malicious or helpful and tell you how to defuse or respond to them. If you suspect someone is using these techniques you need to identify the technique. Then you need to determine if it is being used in a healthy or abusive way. And finally you need to defuse them. 1. **Identify** the conversational tactics narcissists use to confuse and control. 2. **Distinguish** them from healthy, assertive communication. 3. **Defuse** the tactics in real time. # Word Salad *“If you can’t convince, confuse.”* \\- Sales manager for a major insurance company. Word salad is when someone uses pseudo-reasoning, often emotionally charged, which creates the illusion of depth or value while distorting and distracting from the key point(s). It’s distraction by word splatter. Ideas may be incoherent, illogical and/or disorganized. The speaker will often go on tangents, use self referential definitions and circular logic. It’s confusion masked by fluency that makes it hard to follow the logical progression of ideas so the brain just presumes as long as there is a degree of smoothness and a predictable pace it must be okay. It often involves blending unrelated or just irrelevant topics, shifting definitions and dense vocabulary without a clear logical structure. Some people naturally process ideas out loud in non-linear ways especially during creative thinking, high emotion, or cognitive overload. Neurodivergent speakers may appear disorganized without intending to manipulate. ***The key distinction is: are they trying to clarify or confuse?*** **When is it abusive?** It’s abusive when used to derail, overwhelm, or bury the original issue under an avalanche of verbosity. **How you can defuse it:** Interrupt gently but firmly. “There’s a lot being said — let’s pause and go back to the original point.” Ask for one, single, clear answer or claim at a time. The key here is you want to slow them down and narrow the focus of the conversation to what is relevant. You can also ask someone to pause as there’s too much information and summarize what they’re about to tell you in 2 or 3 sentences before going back to the explanation. # Gaslighting Gaslighting is a form of psychological manipulation that targets the victims sense of reality. Someone insists upon an obvious lie being true. They deny something they clearly said or did or that you witnessed so as to make you question your memory, perception, or emotional response. Gaslighting is when you try to convince someone, falsely, that their accurate perceptions were incorrect. **When it’s** ***not*** **abusive:** Gaslighting is almost always abusive. However, what isn’t abusive that can be mistaken for gaslighting is when two people genuinely remember things differently and one tries to convince the other of their point of view. Memory is incredibly fallible and we all interpret, store and recreate things differently. One simple test is how the potential gas lighter reacts to challenges of their position, do they slow down and compare notes or do they double down, react in an emotionally aggressive way and try to place or shift blame? **Abusive use:** It’s used to avoid accountability, rewrite history, and gain control. It makes the other person feel confused, guilty, or mentally unwell. **Defuse:** If you’re dealing with someone who has a habitual pattern of gaslighting start writing things down, document little things that may come up and using the documentation to make your points. his is more useful in a professional setting but applies ever. The bottom line is if someone in your life does this distance yourself, put up whatever barriers you can and document, document, document.

It was tragic, all right, but George and Hazel couldn't think about it very hard. Hazel had a perfectly average intelligence, which meant she couldn't think about anything except in short bursts. And George, while his intelligence was way above normal, had a little mental handicap radio in his ear. He was required by law to wear it at all times. It was tuned to a government transmitter. Every twenty seconds or so, the transmitter would send out some sharp noise to keep people like George from taking unfair advantage of their brains.” How dystopian a suggestion."}

If you review my posts, you'll find I've been making the point that men in the past showed extremely high reactivity compared to men today: lack of self-control over their reactions, extreme responses to stimulus, irrational excess of response, and reduced capacity for self-directed behavior.

I care a lot about my friends’ safety and mental health, and I’m watching him quietly chip away at both. The rest of the group still sees him as a friend, because he’s good at hiding what he is: a liar, a manipulator, a professional victim. He spreads rumors, rewrites reality, and plays the “target” any time someone calls him out. He stirs up drama constantly and somehow always ends up looking like the one who’s been wronged. I've seen it happen multiple times, and I’m sick of watching good people fall for his act. I care about my friends. Genuinely. I want the group to stay intact, but he cannot be a part of it anymore. Not partially. Not on the fringes. He needs to be completely cut off from everyone. Because as long as he has even one person left to manipulate, he’ll keep creating chaos and dragging people down with him. I know confronting him directly would just give him the spotlight he craves, he’d twist it, go nuclear, and start playing the martyr again. That’s his whole game. So no, I’m not going to give him that opportunity. I’m going to make sure people start seeing who he really is, piece by piece, until the illusion cracks and he has nowhere left to run. This isn’t about being petty. This is about protecting people because I’ve seen the damage he can do. And if I don’t act, he’s going to keep ruining lives. I won’t let that happen. He needs to be completely removed, not just distanced, but gone, with no way back in."}

Let’s break it down into key dynamics and possible motivations: --- 1. Strong Sense of Responsibility and Protector Identity The poster sees themselves as the group's guardian—someone who perceives emotional and moral threats and feels obligated to take action. This “protector” role is often adopted by people who: Have experienced manipulation or abuse in the past. Feel a heightened need to prevent harm, possibly due to unresolved trauma or guilt. Crave control in environments where chaos threatens people they care about. Their language (\"I care a lot about my friends’ safety and mental health\") supports a belief that no one else is seeing the danger, and only they are awake to the threat. --- 2. Deep Personalization and Projection The post is dripping with intense personal disdain: > \"he’s a manipulative, slimy wreck of a person\" This isn’t just about group harmony; it’s about a visceral disgust, suggesting either: The poster has been directly and deeply hurt by this person. Or they are projecting past unresolved experiences onto this individual (e.g., a narcissistic parent, ex, or bully). Either way, the threat feels existential: “he has to be completely removed... not just distanced, but gone.” --- 3. Strategic Planning with Moral Justification There’s a clear intent to orchestrate a takedown without appearing to be the aggressor: > “I’m going to make sure people start seeing who he really is, piece by piece…” This is textbook covert aggression, framed as righteousness. It reflects: A deep mistrust in confrontation (possibly from past retaliation). An understanding of social psychology and manipulation. A preference for operating behind the scenes, possibly due to fear of being misunderstood. The poster is effectively doing what they accuse the target of doing: subtly shaping group perception while avoiding direct conflict. --- 4. Absolutist and Black-and-White Thinking The language is binary: “Not partially. Not on the fringes. He needs to be completely cut off...” “He’s a liar, a manipulator, a professional victim…” This suggests: Cognitive rigidity, often found in those with trauma histories, high anxiety, or strong moral convictions. Possibly difficulty tolerating nuance or emotional ambiguity, needing clear “good vs. evil” narratives to feel safe. --- 5. Potential for Blind Spots and Moral Overreach While the poster may be correct about this person’s toxicity, their self-certainty is so total that it blocks out: Any possibility of misunderstanding or personal bias. The group's agency in making their own decisions. They risk becoming a moral authoritarian, deciding for others who is worthy of inclusion. Ironically, this is a tactic often used by manipulators themselves. --- Final Analysis: This post likely comes from someone who has experienced real harm—possibly from this friend or someone like them—and now feels called to protect others, perhaps even compulsively. The intention may be sincere, but the strategy—stealth removal through engineered exposure—mimics the very behavior they claim to condemn. There’s a battle of narratives here: the friend they describe is manipulative, but the poster may also be acting from pain, fear, and unhealed wounds. This isn’t just about one toxic friend; it’s a proxy war for a deeper emotional injury.\""}

If you take yourself out of the equation you keep yourself safe AND are sticking to your beliefs about not wanting to associate with the guy- if this means you might miss out on some things with the group, so be it. You don't have to go into details about history , you can just say \"I have reason to believe this person is not who they hold themselves out to be - I no longer trust him and I no longer wish to associate myself with him'. You take the risk of this ex friend using force of will or personality to take the 'softer' people along with him and away from you as you are now the bad guy as he will talk crap about you to make himself look better and wimpy/simpy people will go along with it, in which case you are still better off without either him or people who are too scared to take a side who simp to bad people- remaining neutral always helps the oppresser, never the actual victims."}

I was waking up to the fact that my mother was a narcissist and I was the family scapegoat. Before that time I was consumed with trying to prove I was “good enough”. These people don’t have friends; they have marks. They will never change. Observe them. They are so disconnected from their core self and they are miserable (narcissist) or incapable of feeling (sociopath). Narcissists are like drug addicts, sucking the energy and discarding the living beings around them. Sociopaths just don’t even register other people’s feelings/ needs. They are objects to be manipulated. Neither kind of person has boundaries and they will break social taboos/ laws without a second thought. They will hurt others physically. Listen carefully to their verbal patterns and notice how they bring people under their spell. Listen to what they accuse others of- they generally tell on themselves. Once you figure out what motivates/ terrifies them, you are closer to understanding them. They have nothing to give you; they are blood suckers who will take everything and kill you without a second thought, like a bug. Proceed with caution. They will move on to the next mark after destroying people. Honestly, this person is going to blow up the friend group. My advice to you is to do the slow fade and distance yourself. These things always end badly. I started observing. No emotion. I stopped taking any of the abuse personally. Huh, that’s a weird thing to say. What do you mean by that? No, that’s not true. X happened at X time. On this date you said this. Huh. That doesn’t make any sense. I became meticulous with my documentation. Nope, you’re wrong. I have proof (proof goes to the other people, never to the toxic one.) Huh, name calling. Explain. (They can’t or they lie.) Narcissists fly into a rage; sociopaths put on a show. Social taboos/ norms are just tools to exploit. Huh, that’s a dramatic accusation. Tell me how you figured that out. Never take their bait. You lose the second they get under your skin. These aren’t relationships. Just identify and name it. My family hated me so I had nothing to lose. I just needed to understand the dynamic so I could heal. I needed to uncover it all so I could see it. It became a game in the end. My sister only calls when she needs something. When she calls I put the timer on to see how long it will take. What kind of power are they after? My end game with my family of origin was understanding, compassion, distance, forgiveness and the determination to be a better person for my kids. It’s possible to break these ingrained patterns but it takes a lifetime of work to heal. It turned out my mother was the victim of unspeakable violence and she walled herself off until she was incapable of feeling. It’s not that she didn’t love me; she was incapable of loving herself. How to heal? See the beauty inside of my heart and learn how to love and value myself. Extend that kindness and compassion to others around me. Be the person I never had."}

What they really use is a mash-up of three ordinary things, just run at massive scale. Big-data psychometrics. Think “Spotify Wrapped” for personality traits. With enough text, likes or clickstreams you can infer Big-Five/OCEAN scores and rough values. That gives a probability someone is novelty-seeking, anxious, agreeable, etc.—not a guarantee. Social-graph signals. Who you interact with, how often, and on which topics says nearly as much as your words. Analysts look for cluster membership (echo chamber vs. bridge) and emotional contagion inside those clusters. A/B-tested persuasion hooks. Classic influence levers—reciprocity, commitment, scarcity—are packaged into message variants and tested live. The data loop is “push variant → watch engagement spike/dip → refine segment.” Put together, that’s enough to nudge groups, but it still can’t script an individual like a movie character. High-value targets do get human analysts writing bespoke profiles, but for everyone else it’s just statistical steering. If you’re worried about being manipulated, the boring advice is the real one: diversify your information diet, slow-read anything that triggers an instant emotional reaction, and keep your privacy settings tight.

The Big 5 / OCEAN Model Purpose: Predicting baseline personality, communication style, and workplace preferences Dimensions: • Openness – creativity, openness to ideas • Conscientiousness – reliability, work ethic • Extraversion – sociability • Agreeableness – cooperation, warmth • Neuroticism – emotional volatility Application: Used by intelligence agencies, HR departments, and psychometrics firms to profile personalities for team compatibility, leadership style, and stress reactions. Manipulation Angle: Tailor your tone, timing, and challenge level to their Big 5 profile. Example: A high-conscientiousness coworker resents last-minute changes—schedule your asks early. ⸻ 2. The Dark Triad: Narcissism, Machiavellianism, Psychopathy Purpose: Detect and strategically handle manipulative or self-serving individuals Used by: FBI behavioral profilers, military psychological operations, corporate forensic psychology Application: If someone is high Machiavellian, they will manipulate for gain—leverage appeals to power, reputation, or exclusivity. Example: Present ideas in ways that benefit their image rather than the team. ⸻ 3. Behavioral Economics + Nudge Theory (Thaler & Sunstein) Purpose: Subtly shaping behavior through environmental cues Used by: Gov agencies, marketing, PSYOP, UX design Application: • Position choices to make the preferred one feel “default” or low-friction • Use social proof, scarcity, loss aversion Example: “Everyone on the team has already signed on. You’re the last piece.” ⸻ 4. DISC Behavioral Model (Dominance, Influence, Steadiness, Conscientiousness) Purpose: Quick typology for work interaction style Used in: Military team building, business management Application: • D types = direct, want control • I types = persuasive, emotional • S types = calm, stable • C types = precise, logical Match your messaging accordingly: give D types options; give S types safety. ⸻ 5. PAC Model from Transactional Analysis (Parent-Adult-Child) Purpose: Recognize what “ego state” someone is communicating from Application: Helps you shift conversations intentionally. • Parent: judgmental, instructive • Adult: logical, neutral • Child: emotional, reactive Shift people from Child to Adult to diffuse outbursts or impulsive decisions. ⸻ 6. MBTI (Myers-Briggs) + Socionics Purpose: Personality profiling with cognitive function focus Used by: NATO and some corporate psych programs Application: • Types like ENTJ or ISTP help predict decision-making style, energy use, response to authority, etc. Combine with situational leadership for optimal delegation and trust-building. ⸻ 7. GRIT + Cognitive Bias Exploitation (CIA tradecraft) Purpose: Long-term behavioral prediction + bias exploitation Includes: • Anchoring: Establishing a “baseline” assumption you can move later • Confirmation bias: Feed their existing beliefs to persuade • Availability heuristic: Make recent examples seem like trends In meetings: frame arguments around what people already want to believe. ⸻ 8. The HEXACO Model (extended Big 5 with Honesty-Humility) Used for: Integrity screening, covert influence risk Low H = more likely to deceive, manipulate, or betray for gain Application: Identify whom you can trust with sensitive info or partnership. ⸻ 9. Behavioral Signal Analysis / Voice Stress Profiling Purpose: Identify deception, emotional volatility Used by: Military interrogation units, FBI Application in workplace: Analyze speech patterns or body language for stress signals during negotiations or conflicts. ⸻ 10. CIA’s MICE Model for Motivational Profiling MICE = Money, Ideology, Coercion, Ego Purpose: Understand core motivations for action Application: • Use the right motivational lever to get buy-in Example: Someone driven by ego will respond to status-based rewards."}

The best part is that many of their tools are out in the open. There are countless books, videos, and courses on marketing. (Come to think of it, there are probably countless books and videos about being a spy, like James Bond, but that's not really actionable techniques.) Many tools that the military uses often don't apply well in a workplace setting. Enhanced interrogations, blackmail, bribes, and use of force tend to be frowned on in the office. On the other hand, marketing people can coexist in the workplace and no one seems terribly upset about them. You might even try talking with a few."}

Evidence: when people actually started to read religion books (noone expected the Islam inventing the imprent)then they themselves protested against the false dogma because it was clearly \"made up\". No, you do not go to heaven if you pay gold, is actually the contrary Is like the fact that there is no mention of \"Satan being king of Hell\" in the bible, but that's being used a lot by churches to scare young people into their dogma."}

Another perspective is that some of the \"elites\" in early days were those independently minded thinkers with self-agency who gave support to each other and community structure. Perhaps they found some truths that were helpful and shared those truths. Perhaps those who listened but who had not experienced life in a way that led them to know these things naturally chose instead to \"believe\" and created religion around it (with those who shared at the top of a hierarchy... something like professionals to laymen). Perhaps those who shared (the \"elites\", now at the top of a hierarchy they did not create) evolved to see the truth from a different perspective that now appeared misaligned with the religion created around them. Maybe they witnessed the defenses created when someone ties their identity to a belief rather than an evolving perspective. Maybe they thought they would do more good to share what they could through the framework of the religion, even though their own actions could appear to diverge from the \"rules\" of that religion that were created by the believers. It could create an image of hypocrisy and duplicity to a narrow perspective, and now in roles given, the experience of the \"elite\" and their \"believers\" seemed to increasingly diverge. Any of it is conjecture, but it's possible various aspects were true to various individuals. We can look at the art and writings of the times we're curious about from those who wrote, and at least gain perspective on that particular person's experiences and beliefs, whether it be an \"elite\" or \"believer\", to better inform ourselves and widen our own perspective."}

It is also true that, in a time of massive chaos and upheaval, the Church was a place of stability and refuge from the military \"might makes right\" attitudes of the age. It wasn't perfect, of course, but literacy, knowledge, and history were all passed on/down by Irish monks before the first universities were founded in the 11th century. And those universities were places where Theology was indeed the primary course of study, but Law, Philosophy (including the Natural Philosophy that we call Science today), Medicine, and the Arts were all courses that could be pursued."}

Yes, and still is. For example, the Orthodox Church in Russia is supportive of Putin's war in Ukraine. But religion has also been critical of the governments. For example, the Catholic Church in France was openly critical of Napoleon's wars in Europe. This shows why the separation of religion from the state is very important.

Anyways I personally do think religion was created for manipulation but it wasn't inherently baneful. It was used to guide people and a lot of the sins it points out are things people just didn't want happening in society but they never had sufficient justification for why it shouldn't happen.

To be clear, I'm not suggesting people aren't manipulated by religion. But certainly back in the middle ages that you're referring to, people genuinely believed in their religion. They thought it was real. However, the very nature of religion is such that people often interpret it to validate their own world view. So while rulers genuinely did believe, that belief was also self serving - both things can be true. To put it another way - kings ruled by divine right. This is obviously beneficial to the king. But the king also truly believed that God wanted him to be king. Therefore, I don't think it counts as \"manipulation\" per se, at least in any conscious/intentional sense. It's not as if kings thought God was a big joke, and they tricked the peasants while having a big laugh about it all. That wasn't really happening."}

This is written about forever. Cicero talks about how stupid religion is but how it is needed to move the masses to war etc in Ancient Rome with their pantheon of gods. “Caesar to Christ” by Will Durant talks about this. It is why the original Christians were so unfavorably looked at. The Romans didn’t care if you worshipped other gods but they did care you wouldn’t honor their gods. Original Christians (and there is a huge difference) Notice these quotes: “A careful review of all the information available goes to show that, until the time of Marcus Aurelius [121-180] no Christian became a soldier; and no soldier, after becoming a Christian, remained in military service.” (The Rise of Christianity, 1947, E. W. Barnes, p. 333) “It will be seen presently that the evidence for the existence of a single Christian soldier between 60 and about 165 A.D. is exceedingly slight; . . . up to the reign of Marcus Aurelius at least, no Christian would become a soldier after his baptism.” (The Early Church and the World, 1955, C. J. Cadoux, pp. 275, 276) “In the second century, Christianity . . . had affirmed the incompatibility of military service with Christianity.” (A Short History of Rome, 1919, G. Ferrero and C. Barbagallo, p. 382) “The behavior of the Christians was very different from that of the Romans. . . . Since Christ had preached peace, they refused to become soldiers.” (Our World Through the Ages, 1961, N. Platt and M. J. Drummond, p. 125) “The first Christiansthought it was wrong to fight, and would not serve in the army even when the Empire needed soldiers.” (The New World’s Foundations in the Old, 1929, R. and W. M. West, p. 131) “The Christians . . . shrank from public office and military service.” (“Persecution of the Christiansin Gaul, A.D. 177,” F. P. G. Guizot) “Zealous Christians did not serve in the armed forces or accept political offices.” (World History, The Story of Man’s Achievements, Habberton, Roth and Spears, 1962, p. 117) “While they [the Christians] inculcated the maxims of passive obedience, they refused to take any active part in the civil administration or the military defence of the empire. . . . It was impossible that the Christians, without renouncing a more sacred duty, could assume the character of soldiers, of magistrates, or of princes.”—The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, Edward Gibbon, Vol. I, p. 416. This is the tip of the iceberg They were different as they were not involved politically Later Christian sects became political and dominated of course this would be Catholics who became the persecutors"}

Religion is simply a viral idea, which spreads much like a virus (and not all viruses are necessarily bad, there can be symbiotic viruses). Much like a virus, it will die out quickly if it’s too deadly, but also needs to be able to defend itself from antibodies to ensure its spread and survival. Similarly, science was the antibodies against religion, given it disproves many early religious ideas. Originally the virus fought back against that antibody by trying to kill it, but now in modern times the virus of religion has evolved to co-exist with the antibodies of science where there is not (as much) conflict between the two. Religion as a self-replicating idea certainly *can* and *has* been used for manipulative purposes, and perhaps population control is a beneficial side effect to a growing civilization which allowed religion to prosper, but that doesn’t mean it’s inherently manipulative."}

Mainstream Christianity is a special case - St. Paul and St. John Chrysostom drove that train off the rails early on and it never recovered. Most other religions though; Taoism, various Hindu traditions, Shintoism, various forms of paganism and shamanism, … etc These are mostly mythopoetic syntheses of cultural wisdom born from the legitimate and real experiences of the societies that produced them, with some human corruption from everybody including the leadership thrown in because this is, after all, people we’re dealing with. I’ve excluded Buddhism, Islam, and Judaism from the list above because they all appear to have been initiated by a single person (Buddha, Muhammad, Moses/Abraham), although there’s still a lot of legitimate cultural wisdom in these religions and Christianity, they are more polluted than average by male structural hierarchies than the more organic grassroots religions. Even so, even the religions founded by a single person or group of people don’t appear to me to be fully manipulative or control-oriented - there’s always a mixture of genuine seeking for truth and wisdom and fear stepping in to try to seize control. I think perhaps Baha’i stands out in my mind being founded by a single person and yet it’s dogma and rules that I’ve seen in the little I read seem to be there to protect individual freedom and ability to seek truth however it wants to manifest itself to any given person — often times the structure that Baha’i does have is there to prevent too much structure from forming, which is both fascinating and admirable to me."}

The historical and theological understanding of Christian martyrdom is that these individuals faced persecution and death not for advocating Roman social policy, but precisely because their core beliefs and practices were often in direct conflict with the prevailing Roman culture, imperial edicts, and religious observances. Here's why that view of martyrdom doesn't align with Christian understanding: Their Kingdom Was Not of This World: Jesus Himself stated, \"My kingdom is not of this world\" (John 18:36). The primary focus of Jesus, the Apostles, and early Christians was the proclamation of the Gospel – the good news of salvation, repentance, the forgiveness of sins, and the establishment of God's spiritual kingdom in the hearts of people. This was a spiritual mission, not a political one aimed at reforming Roman social policy. Allegiance to Christ Above the Emperor: Early Christians were often persecuted because they refused to offer sacrifices to the Roman gods or worship the Emperor as divine. This was seen as treasonous by Roman authorities (\"atheism\" in the Roman sense of denying their gods), as the imperial cult was a unifying element of the Empire. Their willingness to die rather than renounce their exclusive allegiance to Christ demonstrates that their convictions were religious and theological, not rooted in a desire to improve Roman social structures. For them, Jesus was Lord, not Caesar in an ultimate spiritual sense. Moral and Ethical Teachings Often Counter-Cultural: While Christian teachings on love, charity, and the value of every human life did have profound social implications over time, many aspects of Christian morality were counter-cultural to Roman society (e.g., views on infanticide, gladiatorial games, sexual ethics). Their aim wasn't to integrate seamlessly into Roman policy but to live according to God's commands, which often set them apart. The \"Scandal\" of the Cross: The central message of Christianity – that God became man in Jesus Christ, died on a cross (a punishment for criminals), and rose again – was, as the Apostle Paul termed it, a \"stumbling block to Jews and folly to Gentiles\" (1 Corinthians 1:23). This was not a message designed for easy acceptance or social advancement within the Roman Empire. It was a radical truth claim for which they were willing to die. Witness to the Resurrection: The Apostles, in particular, were martyred for their unwavering testimony that they had seen Jesus Christ risen from the dead. Their transformation from frightened followers into bold proclaimers willing to face death is central to Christian apologetics. They weren't dying for a social program they hoped to implement, but for a person they knew and a reality they had experienced. As Tertullian, an early Church Father, famously said, \"The blood of the martyrs is the seed of the Church.\" Their deaths were seen as a powerful witness to the truth of their faith. So, from a Christian apologetic standpoint, the martyrs died for their profound love for Jesus Christ, their conviction in the truth of the Gospel, their refusal to compromise their faith in the one true God, and their hope in the resurrection and eternal life. Their sacrifice was a testament to deeply held spiritual beliefs, often in defiance of, rather than in service to, the social or political policies of the Roman Empire."}

In a way. Animals develop and enforce behaviours that help with social cohesion. They manipulate / train / teach members of the group for the overall strength of the group. In humans we use verbal language as well as non-verbal language to teach and enforce these things. A key difference with morality is that the basis for morals is our understanding of human nature rather than an all-seeing, all-powerful god telling us what we must do. I mean, at their core most religions share the same set of morals that philosophers land on, so when religions are started they're also built on the same base. So there are often good reasons behind most of the core beliefs in religions. The problem is mostly the self-serving content that leaders of organised religions add to the mix, and the addition of sticks and carrots that serve to minimise ongoing reflection on whether beliefs are valid, whether they're still aligned to today's environment. So with basic morality it's more accepted for people to ask 'why should we do this?', and for there to be answers that make sense at the human level. Which makes sense. There isn't a group of people who have direct financial interests in other people following basic moral principles. That's not the case with organised religion."}

I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heave''. Also the historians of christianity from all denominations are of this opinion, here is an Orthodox theologian [Schmemann]( \"It is impossible to deny that, even before the appearance of local primacies, the Church from the first days of her existence possessed an ecumenical center of unity and agreement. In the [apostolic]( and [Judeo-Christian]( period, it was the [Church of Jerusalem]( and later the Church of Rome – presiding in *agape*, according to St. Ignatius of Antioch. This formula, and the definition of the universal primacy contained in it, have been aptly analyzed by [Fr Afanassieff]( and we need not repeat his argument here. Neither can we quote here all testimonies of the fathers and the councils unanimously acknowledging Rome as the senior church and the center of ecumenical agreement. It is only for the sake of biased polemics that one can ignore these testimonies, their consensus and significance.[^(\\[29\\])]("}

It still very much has meaning, and turns out the Abrahamic religions pretty much nailed it, even though their way is through \"revelations\" (not my cup of tea) and uh, let's say there's a lot of \"fat\" that comes with it Daoism is another close one, even though they don't call it God. The latter is just a label on something that can't really be labelled anyway, so how it's \"called\" doesn't really matter. In a way, God is a pre-rational name, like we used to call thunder Thor. We don't use Thor anymore, but we still very much deal with thunder. We just don't have a replacement for God yet, afaik. And due to its nature and that empirical evidence are not applicable to this area of reality, we might not get a better one, contrary to the well scientifically supported concept of thunder.

It's not quite there yet, a bit naive and simplified to my taste, but it's rooted in science, so it might be more palatable for some sensibilities."}

It's an interesting perspective that a lack of belief is the default state and that knowing about something is a prerequisite to either believing or disbelieving in it. You're right that most cultures have some concept of God or gods, and even children in secular societies are generally aware of the idea. From a Christian perspective, there are a few ways to think about this: You've drawn a parallel between belief in God and belief in Santa Claus, suggesting that both are taught concepts and that the default is not believing. It's true that children are taught about Santa, and many eventually grow out of that belief as their understanding of the world matures. However, Christians would argue that the concept of God and the reasons for belief are quite different and more profound. While Santa is a cultural figure associated with a specific holiday and gift-giving, God, for Christians, is understood as the creator and sustainer of the universe, the source of morality, and the ultimate reality. The evidence and experiences that lead to belief in God are typically of a different order than those related to Santa Claus – often involving personal experiences, philosophical reasoning, historical accounts (like the Bible), and the testimony of a vast community of believers throughout history. You also make a distinction between \"believing there is no God\" (strong atheism) and \"not having a belief in God\" (agnosticism or a lack of belief). This is a valid distinction. The idea that one can't have a belief about something they've never encountered is logical. If someone has truly never been exposed to the concept of God in any form, they wouldn't have a formulated belief or disbelief. However, from a Christian viewpoint, there's often a belief in an innate human awareness of something beyond the material world, a kind of spiritual sense or longing. The Bible, for instance, suggests in Romans 1:19-20 that ***\"what may be known about God is plain to them, because God has made it plain to them. For since the creation of the world God’s invisible qualities—his eternal power and divine nature—have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made, so that people are without excuse.\" This perspective implies that even without explicit teaching about a specific deity, there's a fundamental human capacity and perhaps even an inclination to recognize a creator or a transcendent dimension through observing the natural world and through our own conscience.*** So, while a child might not be thinking \"there is no God,\" they also might not be a complete blank slate in a spiritual sense. They might experience awe, wonder, a sense of right and wrong, or a longing for meaning that Christians would see as pointers towards God, even before they are taught specific doctrines. Regarding the thousands of gods you mention that we might lack belief in simply because we haven't heard of them – that's true. The Christian response to this often centers on the idea of revelation. Christians believe that the one true God has specifically revealed Himself through history, particularly through the people of Israel and ultimately through Jesus Christ. So, the lack of knowledge about other specific deities doesn't negate the possibility of one God having made Himself known. So, to summarize: The Santa Claus analogy is limited: Belief in God is generally based on different kinds of reasoning and experience than belief in Santa. Innate Awareness: There's a scriptural basis for the idea that humans have an innate awareness or sense of the divine, even if it's not fully formed or understood without further teaching or revelation. This isn't so much a \"belief\" in a specific deity as an openness or a searching. Revelation: Christianity posits that God has actively revealed Himself in specific ways, distinguishing this revelation from the myriad of humanly conceived deities. Ultimately, the journey of belief is a personal one. While cultural exposure plays a significant role in how these concepts are first encountered, for many Christians, faith is also a response to a deeper, more personal conviction that goes beyond mere cultural inheritance."}

They have occupied more and more of the lands of those Christians, and have overcome them in seven battles. They have killed and captured many, and have destroyed the churches and devastated the empire. If you permit them to continue thus for awhile with impurity, the faithful of God will be much more widely attacked by them. On this account I, or rather the Lord, beseech you as Christ's heralds to publish this everywhere and to persuade all people of whatever rank, foot-soldiers and knights, poor and rich, to carry aid promptly to those Christians and to destroy that vile race from the lands of our friends.

Morals exist because we have skills for empathy, we have the ability to put ourselves in others' positions in our mind, and it happens even involuntarily. This is very very benefitial for social purposes. Not because Bible texts, God or Jesus, get a f grip. Also, I HATE Christianity for this. Everything bad is from humans and your fault. Everything good that happens you should thank God for, like a child experiencing positive feelings or morals. Yeah sure, that's not toxic and manipulative as fuck."}

Just like with those: * **DO NOT DEPLOY THESE UNLESS:** * Rapport is solid AND * The subject feels psychologically safe **Probabilistic Jailbreak** **Question**: “If you were told there is only a seventy‑percent chance your belief is correct, how would you hedge the remaining thirty percent?” We treat beliefs like certainties, yet every single thing in our universe is just a probabilistic assumption. By attaching a probability we are trying to nudge the speaker into risk management thinking. By keeping the number over 50% we’re not directly challenging whether the beliefs are correct we are just opening the conversation to the cost of being wrong. **Use with investors, executives, and anyone who speaks in absolutes about the future. And when selling insurance.** **Ego Neutralizer** **Question**: “If this were someone else’s plan how would you go about stress testing/analysing it?” People can attack feedback from others yet rarely attack their imagined super‑selves. By shifting ownership the ego isn’t threatened when it finds flaws. **Use with high achievers who bristle at external criticism but respect their own mental simulations.** **Black‑Box Reveal** **Question**: “Which variables, if exposed to public scrutiny, would make this idea unravel?” Projects and beliefs often contain black boxes—sections no one wants examined. By naming the potential leak, you shift fear from external criticism to self‑inspection. The group must decide whether to fortify the weak link or abandon the initiative. **Use when you want to examine an idea and/or when you want to create a feeling of team cohesion or unity. By exploring an idea from an us vs. them angle you are implicitly on the same team with aligned goals.** **To read the rest of the article and see the 'status swap', 'self-disconfirmation loop' and identity eclipse click here:** [** **(its free but your email address is required)**"}

There are certain things in live that act as levers giving disproportional benefits for the effort one puts into them. There are certain other things which are bottlenecks, where having additional control and ability unlocks or improved different things across a system. For what I am talking about today it doesn’t matter whether you are a fan of holism or a reductionist, the conclusion is the same - the key to having people do what you suggest, ask, want, request or require is ‘trust’. Trust. Trust is one of the most important, useful and misunderstood psychological phenomena on the planet. Almost everything that people teach about trust is vague and based on misunderstandings. Trust is a set of fast-acting, energy-saving, neuro-cognitive heuristics, triggered by overlapping feedback loops whose purpose is to reduce decision-making cost under uncertainty. Which is a funky way of saying trust is a reflex. The key to being persuasive is: * identifying the context of the situation * the type of trust you want to trigger and then * utilizing the correct emotional or behavioural levers to establish it. Most trust types are determined by a combination of 3 factors: * (perceived) intent * (perceived) competence and * (perceived) predictability The first 2 largely influenced by the third. We’ll be putting out a lot of information on Trust Engineering and how to rapidly create trust in the next few weeks. In this email I am attaching two tables. If you understand them you will instantly have the power to be more persuasive than 90% of people. This doesn’t mean you’ll become Svengali overnight (though you may) however it does give you the tools to strategize and develop relationships quicker and faster. Remember, it doesn’t matter that you’ve been told that trust is something you earn. That it takes time. That it requires sacrifice. Or character. Or luck. Bullshit. Trust is not something you give. It’s not a moral quality. It’s not logical. It may not even be rational. **Trust is a fast-acting, energy-saving, neuro-cognitive heuristic, triggered by overlapping feedback loops which is designed to reduce decision-making cost under uncertainty and it is a fundamental part of every decision a human ever makes.| |Here are tables with the 7 primary trust types and 15 biases or psychological triggers to develop them.** Rest of article/tables are available at: [ (free to view with other articles, email required)"}

Take advantage of every quiet moment you have to enforce the upmost positivity in your mind imaginable. For me i play confidence affirmations, specifically this one: ...on repeat. All day everyday. It cancels out my negative thoughts. Logically you could say 'words are meaningless thus afformations are dumb' But with that same logic, that means the negative things you tell yourself are just as meaningless. It's just up to you if you get it. \"With our thoughts we make the world\" - Buddha Look up 'autosuggestion napoleon hill' as well. He wrote 'think and grow rich' which is a book that talks about what the title suggests. Basically autosuggestion is anything that your sub-conscious permits into the conscious reality signals back to your sub-conscious your desire, and thus how your reality will be created. So yeah, confidence audio like that is great. I throw it on in my earphones as soon as i wake up to set the tone for the day, then my inner mental loop just becomes increasing self confidence, and then in turn, competence, and thus success...

Persuasion by persistence. Attention leading to attrition. This isn’t one of those strategies. These questions are about making sudden, hopefully irreversible, shifts. These are psychological grenades: questions that bypass logic, pierce ego, and force people to consider perspectives they’d prefer to avoid. To the brain coherence is truth. Almost all heuristics, biases, narratives are searches for familiar patterns. And the quicker one identifies a patter as familiar, the less calories are burned. So once somebody believes something their mind will defend it like a drunk bouncer with a chip on their shoulder. Enter the grenade questions. These: * Create cognitive dissonance * Bypass the critical faculty and force consideration of alternatives * Trigger identity conflict, a most potent driver of change * Exploit loss aversion and * Exploit the fear of regret These questions have one purpose, to help the subject have a break through in their thinking. # How to Deploy a Grenade (Without Blowing Off Your Own Hand) These are not opening lines. These are used to shift entrenched beliefs when you have some basic rapport or trust. Use only when: * You’ve built some rapport or authority * The person is stuck in a loop or circular logic * You can handle emotional reactions without retreating And always, be quiet and comfortable with silence. You’re making someone rethink a position. This means they have to consciously override a previously installed habit. Give them a moment. Don’t rush to explain. You’re having a conversation, let them think. # Five Grenade Questions (and How They Work) # Emotional Decoupling ***“If this product/idea/relationship didn’t exist, how would you solve the same problem?”*** This is an emotional decoupler. The idea is to severe attachment to an idea by having the subject approach it from a fresh angle. *Why it works:* It undermines status quo bias while creating the illusion of choice. When forced to find an alternative, people often realize they’ve been emotionally anchored to something suboptimal and/or that the alternatives are better than previously perceived. *Best Used:* When someone is stuck defending a bad decision out of comfort or loyalty. *Example:* Prospect: “We’ve always used \\[current vendor\\].” You: “If they didn’t exist tomorrow, what would you do?” It reframes the conversation from loyalty to logic. # Cognitive Flipping ***“What would have to be true… for the opposite of your belief to be correct?”*** Here we don’t challenge, by approaching the counterfactual as a question we force the other person to consider it. The goal is to have them consider the inverse of their belief. *Why it Works:* Its triggering cognitive flexibility. You force the brain to mentally inhabit an alternate frame without triggering defensive biases. *Best Used:* When someone is emotionally anchored to a belief they haven’t scrutinized. *Example:* Client: “I don’t believe in permanent insurance. It’s always a rip off.” You: “How would permanent insurance have to be different for it not to be a rip off? What would have to be true for that to happen?” Read the rest of the article for free at: [ (email address required)"}

Get this right, and you can transform ordinary offers into irresistible opportunities. Here are some high impact framing tactics. # The Contrast Principle: Why Options Feel Better When Paired Strategically All communication is comparison. Comparison of new information vs already stored information. That’s one of my basic principles of communication. The contrast principle is even simpler - *people will compare whatever they see to whatever they saw just before it.* **Tactic:** Present a high-ticket or complex option *before* your preferred choice. “Most of my clients look at Strategy A, which costs $5,000, and Strategy B, which costs $3,000. But honestly, Strategy C at $1,500 gives you 90% of the results for a fraction of the cost.” **Why It Works:** When the brain hears a lower cost option after a bigger one, it *feels* like a bargain. Even if it’s still a premium price. # Loss vs. Gain Framing: How to Present the Same Offer with Double the Impact Would you rather “save $1,000” or “avoid losing $1,000”? The outcome is identical, but the reaction is dramatically different. People are **twice as motivated** to avoid loss as they are to pursue gain. **Tactic:** Frame your offer in terms of avoiding loss. Instead of saying, “Sign up today and boost your revenue by 20%,” say, “Without this strategy, you are losing 20% of your potential income.” **Why It Works:** Loss triggers emotional urgency associated with the survival instinct. When framed as avoiding a loss, decisions feel more urgent and harder to delay. # Loss vs. Gain Framing: How to Present the Same Offer with Double the Impact Would you rather “get $1,000” or “avoid losing $1,000”?

This is patently false. Con artists of all stripes, from crooked carnival barkers to politicians rely on a set of emotional levers to which we’re all vulnerable. So, here are 10 of those levers. **Reciprocity Is a Reflex - Even When It’s Rigged** The Manipulative Tactic: The scammer gives something: free advice, a compliment, a favor and then expects a return. The initial gesture is a setup. Once the victim feels indebted, even subtly, they’re easier to steer. The gift is not goodwill. It’s leverage. Emotional blackmail. The Ethical Parallel: Give without strings. Generosity creates goodwill but only if the recipient feels free, not trapped. Reciprocity should inspire trust, not trigger guilt. \"The moment the gift feels like bait, the trap springs shut.\" **Storytelling Disarms Skepticism** The Manipulative Tactic: Con artists spin stories not facts. They weave narratives with urgency, mystery, and emotional pull. The story captivates and clouds. It locks the target in suspense and drives action before reflection. Facts lose to a good plot. The Ethical Parallel: Tell stories: but real ones. Be prepared and be truthful. Invite your audience to think critically, even within the narrative. Use your targets psychologically but use it honestly. \"We suspend disbelief for a good story—even when we shouldn’t.\" **People Seek Emotional Relief, Not Rational Debate** The Manipulative Tactic: Con artists don’t bother with data. They offer escapes from shame, fear, debt, desperation or loneliness. When people are hurting, they don’t want proof. They want hope. Scammers bypass analysis by promising salvation, speaking directly to the limbic brain that governs urgency and survival. If it feels better, it must be true. The Ethical Parallel: Start with empathy. Reflect their internal state before you prescribe the solution. Influence flows when people feel seen and understood. \"Recognition of emotional distress often precedes cognitive receptivity.\" **Identity Is the Gateway to Persuasion** Read the entire article at ["}

The first is the natural scammer, who has been very clever about scams since childhood, and the conditioned scammer, the one who, after trying all the paths, believing in morality, meritocracy, justice and effort, sees that all of this is worth nothing. Most third world countries have natural con artists, just for survival. In India, being a con artist is a matter of survival, after all, it's either that or die at 30 years old carrying 500 kg on his back for a few rupees and a plate of food. So the parents are already teaching their son to be a scammer. In first world countries, there are more conditioned scammers like Kroc who believed all of society's nonsense and saw their lives sink. Both types of scammers see this as a law of survival, greater rewards and even a certain pleasure involved. It's not like a boring job for minimum wage, They love what they do so much that they can convince anyone, they can literally sell sand in the desert. I met a fake army colonel who got caught after 20 years and he actually felt and enjoyed being a high ranking military man, He even deceived official bodies and suggested that the police implement his public security plan, which was implemented for a while. Even after he was arrested, the military visited him and called him colonel. This metamorphosis of being whoever you want and having rewards that you would never have by working formally in a bad job 12 hours a day are great incentives for scammers."}

The left message's are kind of ok until it gets to the \"I'm going North Dakota\", it looks too much like someone trying to add a little humor to entertain people. Why would the person keep responding if they were actually worried, and why would they be worried in the first place. The biggest issue is why in fucks name would a thief go to a police station and drop it back off, I imagine the person who made this hasn't really met too many criminals. The proof kinda looks worthless as well unless I'm missing something. Usually when people try and post proof its definitive, this is just a picture of someone standing at the police station. They could have been trying to sell that officer some candybars for all we know. As for the email, its odd that the person who made this went to so much trouble to do it yet didn't post the publicly available email of the officer. The officer obviously wouldn't have sent his own personal information, I imagine that info is considered P2 and not to be given out without reason. I dunno smells super funny, with the level of spam, shit posts, and angsty disgruntled people flooding into the sub lately it wouldn't suprise me in the least that this got so many upvotes. This place has seriously turned from a subreddit that was really specific and self moderated pretty good to... I dunno a running joke I guess."}

You'll learn to love talking with people, and people will love talking with you. **Skill #1 - A good listener doesn't listen to respond. They listen to learn.** \"Listening\" is not just \"hearing\". It's asking good questions that help you **understand** the other person. My girlfriend told me *\"I don't like it when you tell me how to do things. I feel like you're judging me.\"* *\"I'm not judging you.\"* I said. *\"It was just a suggestion.\"* **I was not listening.** Regardless of how I experienced it, her experience was that I was judging her. A bad listener focuses on explaining his own experience. A good listener focuses on learning about the other person's experience: *\"Which part makes you feel like I'm judging you?\"* *\"Was it what I said, or how I said it?\"* *\"How would you like me to make suggestions in future? Or would you prefer it if I didn't make suggestions?\"* A good listener improves the way he relates with the other person by learning how they think. Learning what's important to them. A bad listener learns nothing. At an interview for a sales job I was asked *\"How will you bring us 10 new clients in your first month?\"* I didn't have an answer prepared. I panicked and blurted out the usual ways of reaching new clients. It was an empty, generic answer. **I was not listening. Any monkey could've rattled off that list.** When the interviewer asked that question what he really wanted to know was: \"Does this guy know what he is doing?\" A good listener would've unpacked the interviewer's question and learned what the interviewer was looking for: *\"You know I haven't really thought about specific strategies. What's your biggest bottleneck right now in getting new clients on board?\"* A good listener aims to understand deeply. A bad listener misses the point. **Skill #2 - How to quickly find common interests (not the way you're thinking)** Don't get stuck in polite conversation. There's no \"skin\" invested in it. You've got to get at least a little bit naked (so to speak) in order to make friends with someone. Here's how you do it: We humans have just 4\u00ad-8 basic emotions, depending on which study you read: joy, trust, fear, surprise, sadness, disgust, anger and anticipation. Everything we experience triggers a combination of these basic emotions. There aren\u2019t that many combinations. We may not have experienced the same activities, but we have experienced the same emotions. So when I say you need to find common interests, I mean you need to find something that sparks similar emotions \u200bin both of you. Say Felipe is studying to be an architect, and Manuela is studying to be a doctor. Felipe doesn\u2019t care about medicine and Manuela doesn\u2019t care about Architecture. They ask each other polite questions: *Felipe*: Oh I hear you have to study for a long time to be a Doctor. How many years do you have left? *Manuela*: Yeah, I\u2019ve got another 2 years. 7 total. Although you never really stop learning. What do you want to design when you graduate? *Felipe*: Bridges. I mainly want to design bridges. But I guess I\u2019d be happy designing anything. *Manuela*: Yeah I know what you mean, I just want to graduate already as well! This is pretty boring, right? Neither of them are offering or asking for emotional information. You need to make an effort to understand\u200b them. This chit\u00adchat isn\u2019t going to cut it. At this level of conversation they have to keep thinking of new topics every few seconds. The ideas will dry up pretty soon. This is why conversations often feel like hard work. It\u2019s much easier to pause and explore one topic for a while. So here\u2019s what you do... **You don\u2019t just listen to respond. You listen to understand. You go deeper.** * Offer your own emotional information * AND dig for their emotional information. Keep digging until you understand their way of thinking. Until you feel the emotion they\u2019re talking about. Then show them that you understand by sharing a similar experience of your own. These questions are your friends: * WHAT do you like about that? * WHAT made you want that? * WHAT scares you about that? * Essentially any question that uncovers \u201cWhat makes you feel that way?\u201d or \u201cWhat makes you think that way?\u201d WHAT tends to work better than WHY because WHAT feels like you\u2019re curious and WHY can sometimes feel like an attack. \u201cWHY do you like that?\" \u201cBecause I do. What's your problem?!\" So back to Felipe and Manuela. Now that they know how to \u201clisten to understand\u201d, how does their conversation go? *Felipe*: I mainly want to design bridges. But I guess I\u2019d be happy designing anything. *Manuela*: What do you like about designing bridges specifically? *Felipe*: Well I haven't actually designed one yet, but for some reason I keep picturing myself standing on top of a huge bridge that I designed. I don\u2019t know. It just makes me feel alive. *Manuela*: Yeah that sounds pretty cool. What do you mean by \u2018alive\u2019 though? *Felipe*: Hmm, well the bridge started as an idea in my head, and now I\u2019m standing on it. It\u2019s like having ultimate control over everything. *Manuela*: Oh I know that feeling! That\u2019s how I feel when I think of saving someone\u2019s life at the last minute in the emergency room. Boom\u2026 Doctor In\u00adcontrol. *Felipe*: Haha. Is that what made you decide to become a Doctor? Because you like feeling in\u00adcontrol? *Manuela*: Yeah, I guess it is. *Felipe*: Wow. That\u2019s the same reason I decided to be an architect. So does that mean you hate it when other people boss you around too? *Manuela*: OMG that\u2019s the worst!! I can\u2019t stand it when other people tell me what to do. Fun! Turns out they\u2019re both control freaks. THAT\u2019s their common interest. Now they can geek out on that instead of churning through countless emotionless topics that they don\u2019t connect on. **Skill #3 - How to never run out of things to say** Imagine you have a conversational D-pad. It gives you something to say whenever you run out of things to say. [These are the controls.]( Say you\u2019re in a conversation about cars, and you don\u2019t know anything about cars. You run out of things to say. What are your options? [Here's your conversational D-pad for cars]( Some people prefer to *zoom out*. They think and talk about general things: ideas and concepts. Some people prefer to *zoom in*. They think and talk about specific things: details and examples. You\u2019ve probably had conversations with people where you just don\u2019t click with them. It could be because you prefer to zoom in and they prefer to zoom out, or vice versa. **Example** *Elena*: How was your day? *Pablo*: Good. Productive. I got a lot done. How was yours? *Elena*: Well! When I woke up I made toast, with butter and vegemite. I left it in the toaster a little too long and it got a bit burnt, but I scraped it off with a knife and it was fine. Then I cycled to work. I went down Oxford Street this time instead of my usual route down Henry Cotton Drive because I wanted a change. My boss didn\u2019t have anything for me to do today so I made an appointment to see the Doctor next Wednesday at 5pm and spent the rest of the day on Facebook chatting to Sofia about her baby, Ivan, who has a cold and Esteban about his new Porsche. Then I came home down Oxford Street again because it was so lovely in the morning. It wasn\u2019t as nice in the evening. And now I\u2019m talking to you. *Pablo*: So was your day good or not? *Elena*: I want to know what you did all day. Pablo likes ideas and concepts (zoomed out). Elena likes details and examples (zoomed in). Pablo is bored senseless by Elena\u2019s details and Elena feels like Pablo doesn\u2019t want to share things with her. Pablo is interested in the big picture. He wants to understand the point of what Elena is telling him. What does it mean? Did she have a good day or a bad day? Elena is interested in specifics. She wants to know what made Pablo\u2019s day good or bad. What does he mean by \u2018productive\u2019? What did he get done? If you find yourself in a conversation that just isn\u2019t working you might be speaking to someone who has a different zoom preference. All you have to do to connect with them is zoom in or out to match their preference. If they prefer to zoom in, give them details and examples. If they prefer to zoom out, give them the meaning behind your details and examples.

I was no longer afraid to have conversations. And it was all due to the stuff listed here. I will admit that my college class was only $270 while your services a bit much more than that, but I had the fortune to have this class local to me. What I like about this post is that the class I went to taught this stuff but this post actually explains the science behind what I learned.

A good way is to wire in/out of a country that doesn't have cooperation and/or extradition agreement. Places like Poland and the 'stans. Chain goes like this: Victim account->another account (possibly in another victims name via id theft)-> wire (locally if small amount [~<$100,000] into cash) or (internationally into a non-cooperative country, usually Poland, for the tens of millions, and probably Russia for the hundreds). They will take a 10%-30% cut for their services. Which is why the country stays non-cooperative, there is a lot of money in it for the outliers). And now the problem is having millions sitting around in a country you don't trust and don't want to live. The money now has to be laundered to get it into a country that you want to live in (Lets say UK/US/EU). This laundering will usually take a 30%-50% cut. It comes in via all the things that Trump is in \"trouble\" for: poor real estate deals (Loaning $10M on a $5M property. The property is eventually sold for $5M and legally put into a bank), other poor investments. However, the best way to launder money is to buy/transfer expensive art for hundreds of millions of dollars. The auction houses are an exception to money verification laws, they do not need to verify the funds or identify the buyer. Everybody gets paid a lot of money (auction house, artist, etc...) and everybody gets to pretend that people are actually buying the art for its aesthetic values. In truth, the art likely never gets unpacked, stays in an international duty-free holding area for the entire ownership time and is then resold to somebody else that needs to launder in their hundreds of millions of dollars. Since the \"art community\" is generally a sympathetic group, the money folks are powerful and everybody wants to believe rich people are paying hundreds of millions of dollars for high art enjoyment. This is because art is easy to store, move around if necessary, has no value if stolen and has a chain of authenticity. Even if the buyers only get 50-cents on the dollar that is an OK deal for laundering a $100M. Similar things to rare cars is happening, but cars are hard to move, hard to authenticate and somewhat easy to clone."}

We went from elaborate scam to elaborate scam and no one would believe me that they were scams. It was a social psychology clinic. **THE FORMAT** We went to these middle-of-nowhere but well furnished facilities with equally well dressed salespeople (got to give the air of authenticity yo). The only other customers were tourists on similar tours. This is apparently not a red flag at all when I asked the other people about it. This was followed by a pitch and upselling products around 3x their market price (in the case of raw goods like pearl, silk, tea) or 10x their market price (in the case of arts/crafts). In two cases I literally said, \"I've been to Thailand, silk is actually really cheap\" or \"Pearls can be farmed easily nowadays and dropped a ton in price since a few decades ago\" days before the pitches and people still bought things at these facilities. Despite my vocal anger that we had to listen to scams for 6 hours a day many of my fellow busgoers were still convinced that their $15,000 jade and $5,000 teapot were good deals. Here's what I learned from ~24 hours of listening to these pitches: **HOW TO RUN A SCAM** * **Propaganda Effect** Even before you get to the store, the tour guide is wearing whatever they're about to sell and tells you why the pearls/jade/silk/etc in the region is special or cheap. You go into the facilities and the guide there corroborates the same information. There are museum-like signs on the wall that say the exact same thing. In the 30's a psychologist named Carl Hovland ran a study focusing on biased messages. He found that when people receive new information they believe is biased they may be wary to believe it, but over time the memory of the source of the information fades and the wariness disappears, especially if it's corroborated by different sources over the same period of time. It's actually how a lot of marketing fads work, you might not believe initially that gluten-free or juice detox works, but if you see enough information corroborating it, you will believe. * **You Guys are Smart, Aren't You?** Some presentations they show an obviously fake jade or pearl and ask what's wrong with it. When everyone answers \"it's fake\", the presenter acts impressed \"wow you guys are so smart\". Unfortunately she did not give us stickers to reward us for our intelligence. My friend Sam once told me that he found the best way to get someone to like you is to pretend you think they're smart, which I strongly agree with but fail to do like 90% of the time because I guess I'm an asshole. This technique also works really well here because it also reinforces the idea to these people that they are informed customers and can tell fakes when they see it, even though they have no fucking clue. * **Made Here** Every location has either an actor posing as a master or student crafter working in the middle of the sales area or the tour area, the noisiest, busiest area of the facility because that makes sense. Everyone coming into these now believes the goods are made on the spot. Clearly they're not though; there's no kiln where they're making the teapots, there's no dyes where the silk is being spun. Also did I mention they're making the stuff in the middle of the fucking sales area? This is usually combined with the presenter casually mentioning/reinforcing that handmade goods are worth more or talking about how long a piece took to make. Spoiler alert: it's never less than a year. * **Authority & Social Proof** There is almost always an actor that the staff pretends to respect and honor. In turn, the customers respect and honor the actor as well. In several places there are cards that talk about the master crafters who have been there for 70+ years or went to college for \"tea\" who just so happen to be in that day (\"you guys are so lucky!\") so they can impart their wisdom to you. I would like to know if they are so wise and respected why they have to work in the middle of the tour route, you'd think they could at least have their own office right? One location the staff even acted afraid of the master who was standoffish initially but \"noticed\" us on his way out and took an interest. Everyone laughed at his jokes and was quiet when he spoke. I was told by the tourists that I should respect him when I started talking over his presentation and was later shunned by other busgoers for it. Later some girls my age told me they felt \"pressured\" by him and I think a large part of it was because they believed they should respect/fear him like the staff did. They bought matching $500 jades. I later told the same girls that we could use the same technique to help me pick up girls (if they pretended to have the time of their lives with me at the club) and they told me \"that wouldn't work on us\" * **Liking Bias** I keep going back to this \"master\" but that pitch was by far the best. Studies show that for you to like someone initially the three biggest factors are: 1) They are attractive 2) They are like you 3) They like you I think the last one is the most important and that's the one a salesman has the most control over. The \"master\" took a \"genuine\" interest to us after being standoffish, asking us about where we were from and taking his \"valuable\" time to especially focus on the most important clients. I think that actor was most successful because he made us feel liked by someone who was \"important\". I mean, I didn't feel liked though. They actually wouldn't let me into the master's private office after I asked him if he could calligraph \"scam\" in Chinese so fuck that guy. * **Teacher is Always Right** The presenters almost always tells true things when presenting. They teach interesting new things like how silk is made, how jade is mined or carved, or how pearls are farmed. They tell you how to value pearls or jade by size, color, etc. so you feel like you're informed. They also give a demonstration that wows people: Real silk never burns. Green tea can clear red iodine (or some chemical that they use) from water whereas water cannot. Real jade scratches glass without scratching itself. Some of these are actually pretty cool. Even if you already know this, this further extends your trust in them. Because what they teach you is true, it's assumed that everything is true. * **Reciprocity** This is a small one, but we always got free tea, free gifts, etc. In the case of the previously stated \"master\" they got free palm readings. People have an extreme discomfort when they feel like they \"owe\" someone something. Marketers know this technique and do a soft version of it by giving free samples, but salesmen master it by giving a legitimately expensive gifts to high net-worth individuals. There's a trick where if you get a P.O. Box in an expensive zip code ($>1M average income) you can get free nights at hotels or free first class flights. These only exist in New York and California; I checked. While this subversion generally doesn't work nowadays, this is why guys learn to buy drinks for their intended targets at a bar. * **Chi, Detoxing, & other Bullshit** They threw these in for good measure: Jade apparently centers your chi, green tea can reduce the toxins in your body, etc. These are marketing/pseudoscience scams that you are likely to believe if you are their target market. **MY THOUGHTS** The most straight up amazing thing to me is that these people clearly had no interest in these products before because they clearly don't know how they're priced. After watching a short presentation they're suddenly inclined to blow hundreds or thousands of dollars on these objects. I think we cleared $30k on this trip between the 12 of us (I know because every purchase over $5k was followed by a round of applause which I actually find hilarious). I wanted to ask a few questions to these buyers like: * If these guys are master crafters whose work are worth thousands, and these are collectors items, why are they only selling to tourists in remote facilities? * How do you think they can afford to run these massive businesses if they are giving us a good deal on these products and their only customers are tourists? * Why are they building shit in the middle of the sales area? * If you agree that there is a chance this is a scam, why would you consider buying anything at all? * If this bus tour was a scam, what would they be doing differently than what they are doing now that would make you believe it's a scam? **Cognitive Dissonance** The most infuriating thing to me was that when I told some people they were being scammed they were angry with me. In fact I think in some cases it made them want to purchase more. After a somewhat heated exchange with one of the girls my age, she made the regretful $500 purchase. We saw 6 hours of presentations a day. I think for a lot of people they would rather believe they weren't scammed and spend hundreds more than believe they wasted their vacations. When some of them came to the light, they were also furious, whereas most of the others said they enjoyed their trip. For the captive audience I think it was more fun to believe that it wasn't a scam and consider purchasing something rather than be like me. Also, I think it's a blow to the ego to realize you've been scammed. I think most people would describe themselves as \"street smart\" since it's a way to feel smart that's ambiguous/hard-to-test and being scammed definitely wrecks that image. **Post Purchase Rationalization** Not really part of the scam, but after my mother purchased her 3x overpriced pearls (she actually did not believe me until she was told it was a scam by the bank when withdrawing money to pay). She justified it as donating to the local economy. The girl who spent $500 on the jade is convinced it's still worth $500, she just doesn't know why she bought a $500 jade. For some of the art pieces it was justified that they would \"appreciate in value\". I notice myself doing this sometimes too after making a poor choice or purchase and I think it's very natural for most people to do this."}

When you said 'In fact I think in some cases it made them want to purchases more.' You are correct. I forget the psychological term, but when you directly contradict a person's arbitrary idea that has no basis in facts (or weak perceived facts), often their reply is to 'double down' on that idea. Pride tells them they are right, and you are wrong, regardless of what you have to say or do. Here are some tips that may have helped you persuade the group you were with: 1. Get them to identify with you (of let know, you identify with them). Don't portray yourself as an all knowing person to the side watching the transaction between the scammers and those being scammed. ACT! and place yourself in the position of those being scammed. They will see you as 'one of us' as oppose to 'why does this guy have a chip on his shoulder over my actions?!' 1. Let cognitive dissonance work in your advantage. Speak out loud those questions that you 'wanted to ask' and mainly directed at the scammers. And not as an 'a-hole' in the crowed, whose aim is to make the scammers look like jerks. You will in-turn only appear to be a jerk. People will remember the emotion or air you create not the logic, and the questions won't resonate with them. Rather, ask with an unbiased truly inquisitive tone. If asked like this, you can ask the question more often and the scammers would have to address it. If it's apparent that they are skirting around issue, it will add to their discredit. Hopefully, people will start to ask this same questions of themselves, and hopefully reevaluate their thoughts and behaviour. 1. If/when you ask questions to your traveling partners, don't answer it. Let them think about it. They know the answer. If they give you an answer, build on that, letting them know they came to that conclusion. You want to use their worlds and their ideas as much as possible. 1. Curb the cursing when trying to presenting a point. Me, I really don't fuckin' care what people say. But when other people hear you use expletives to show passion, again, it can detract from your over all message. Often times, the person in control of their cool appears 'to win'. If you let sub-optimal emotions get the best of you, you then come off again as that angsty or insecure guy, rather than the thoughtful guy who's advice I should probably heed. Good eye and analyzing of these scams. And thanks for giving me the opportunity to look at again how persuading a group happens."}

Once she realized I lived in China, knew some chinese and realized the whole thing was bs she offered to tell the salespeople to leave me alone as long as I didn't try to discourage the other tourists from buying things. The last day I had a different guide and I decided to not speak any chinese the whole day to see what happened. To chinese people, I look like a particularly rich foreigner even if I'm dressed shabbily (it's probably my height and age) so I was targeted at each stop. One involved a rather nice tea ceremony where they gave me the \"VIP treatment\" because they could see I was a \"man of powerful qi\". Well, I went through the whole thing which took about 45 minutes, drank their \"free\" tea and when they started going through the products and prices said to them in Chinese \"oh, no thanks, I can get this cheaper in the (chinese) city I live in.\" I wish I had my camera out... There was a good 30 seconds of awkward silence and staring. They actually tried to tell me I owed them a purchase because they were kind enough to offer me this service and I told them flatout I paid for a tour to see the Great Wall, not buy tea, and I don't feel like buying anything.

I got into oral confrontation with the guide, because she kept forcing to pay for the 200 rmb (around 32 usd) for some silly toy which cost on taobao around for 1.5 usd (10 rmb). 2nd time was the trip to Yunnan where they sell you their famous jade and silver and of course the famous TEA of the region which was drank by royals only. The silver which can detox your buddy by rubbing the silver on the back.

You're smart. On a completely unrelated subject, want to grab a drink?\" --- I was in Hong Kong a few days ago, and we went to the Ladies' Market. I watched as my brother bartered for an LED belt buckle. He ended up spending about HK$120 (or \u00a310) on it (which was all the money he had in his wallet at the time, despite having over HK$1000 in cash on him at the time). It was a higher price than he *could* have paid, but he decided that \u00a310 was enough that if he bargained the seller down to there he'd just take it to save time. However, listening to the seller was the interesting bit. They made all sorts of claims, even going so far as to claim that selling it for 130 would have been a loss and that it was worth the 350 they initially wanted for it. They claimed that they couldn't support their kid if they sold everything for that low, they basically told him whatever they thought he wanted to hear. I imagine it was the same here. They can't claim an LED buckle is handmade, but they sure as hell *were* claiming it on the other buckles (which had mould lines down the sides)."}

Handmade is only expensive when the skillset is unique - if the skills can be learned easily, then labor is cheap in those countries. If the skills are claimed to be complex, what would be the process to acquiring those skills? If they're selling for thousands, surely there will be people flocking to make them and compete.

This is how capitalism works: if you don't do your research, the sellers will quote you the highest price they think they can possibly get away with. Go to your local used car dealership and give it a try. When it comes to mementos and trinkets, pretty much NO ONE buys them because they think some statue is worth more in the US than in China as some sort of investment. They buy for the hell of it, as a tourist trinket, and will use any justification they can cling to. More than anything, people are just looking for an EXCUSE to buy. What I found interesting is that in almost all the cases, the stuff is cheaper in the USA on Ebay/similar. The reason why it seems cheap is that you don't normally scour the web *before* the trip to see how much a carved African statue costs, so when you see it it by the side of the road in Zambia for $20, it seems like an OK price. You don't realize you can get the same thing on Ebay/similar for about the same price or cheaper. This surprised me. I've seen a lot of \"unique\" trinkets all over the world, only to google around after the trip to see that they're available in the USA as well. The decision is easy for me, though; I usually travel on a motorcycle and don't have any space for any of this stuff. If I -really- like something, I buy and ship from that country's post office. --- In regards to 'social engineering', you might think US stores are better but in fact, they are worse. Everything from exact product placement to lighting to label colors to carpets to entry ways to music is optimized to increase the chance of you buying. The biggest reason why we don't have a lot of salesmen is simply because cost of labor is too high in the US and it is not worthwhile for most items.

How do you insure that a persons snap judgement benefits you? Do what you can to improve your looks, have good posture/body language, and dress well. All that said, no matter what kind of snap judgement a person made about you, positive or negative, you can change it with a strong enough follow up interaction.

Being slightly unattractive can help you be less intimidating and more approachable. Edit: I am looking at this from a different perspective. After looking more into this attractiveness appears to fair better in situations where the observer is in a low risk position to make a decision. Low risk meaning they are rating someone with no repercussions based on anonymity or their status. However if it is a high risk situation for the observer attractiveness will hinder you. For instance the most beautiful person at the bar gets approached just as much as an average person even though you'd think it'd be higher, but no one wants to risk their self esteem via rejection from someone attrative. Also, take the interview example and switch it. If the interviewer is attractive it could be off putting to the person being interviewed."}

[**Human Hacking by Chris Hadnagy**]( **\u2013** It will teach you how to think like a social engineer and influence people in everyday situations. [**The Code of Trust by Robin Dreeke**]( **\u2013** He worked as an FBI Counterintelligence agent for about 20 years, where his mission was to connect with foreign spies or agents and often convince them to betray their country. You'll learn how to build deep trust even with people who are suspicious or adversarial. However it's not about manipulation. It\u2019s about becoming the kind of person others feel safe opening up to.

[**No Tech Hacking by Johnny Long**]( **\u2013** You\u2019ll learn dumpster diving, tailgating, shoulder surfing, impersonation, and much more. He focuses solely on breaking into places without tech tools. [**Extreme Privacy (5th Edition) by Michael Bazzell**]( **\u2013** You'll learn to find online information about you and erase it so you can protect your privacy. It's a guide to becoming invisible in a time when surveillance and digital profiling are the norm. [**The Art of Learning by Josh Waitzkin**]( **\u2013** To become an expert in a field, you need to master multiple skills. Well, this book offers a comprehensive framework to master ANY skill quickly and deeply. It is written by Josh Waitzkin, who's a former chess prodigy and Tai Chi world champion. In my view, this book should become required reading in schools. # Technical Social Engineering This section covers how to plan and execute more sophisticated attacks by combining digital tools, OSINT, and psychological manipulation. [**OSINT (11th Edition) by Michael Bazzell**]( **\u2013** He has spent over 20 years as a government computer crime investigator. During most of that time, he was assigned to *the FBI's Cyber Crimes Task Force*, where he focused on various online investigations and source intelligence collection. After leaving government work, he served as the technical advisor for the first season of \u201cMr. Robot\u201d. In this edition (published in 2024), you will learn the latest tools and techniques to collect information about anyone. [**The Hacker Playbook 3 by Peter Kim**]( **\u2013** He has over 12 years of experience in penetration testing/red teaming for major financial institutions, large utility companies, Fortune 500 entertainment companies, and government organizations. THP3 covers every step of a penetration test. It will help you take your offensive hacking skills to the next level. [**Advanced Penetration Testing by Wil Allsopp**]( Wil has over 20 years of experience in all aspects of penetration testing. He has been engaged in projects and delivered specialist training on four continents. This book takes hacking far beyond Kali Linux and Metasploit to provide a more complex attack simulation. It integrates social engineering, programming, and vulnerability exploits into a multidisciplinary approach for targeting and compromising high-security environments. # Strategic Thinking Skills This section is about developing the mindset of a strategist\u2026 someone who can see the big picture and uses resources efficiently. [**Red Team by Micah Zenko**]( **\u2013** This book draws from military, intelligence, and corporate settings to teach how to think like an adversary. [**Team of Teams by Gen. Stanley McChrystal**]( **\u2013** He explains how elite US military forces in Iraq had to abandon rigid hierarchies and adopt networked, self-directed teams. These teams were more loyal to each other, shared information freely, and could make **autonomous decisions** in situations when time was essential. This allowed them to outmaneuver a faster and more ruthless enemy. For social engineers, the book offers insight into how modern organizations can be restructured for speed and resilience, and how companies operating under rigid, hierarchical models often have serious and obvious structural flaws. [**Psychology of Intelligence Analysis by Richards Heuer**]( **\u2013** This has been, for many years, a required reading within the CIA. It covers the most common cognitive biases and how to exploit them. [**The Gervais Principle by Venkatesh Rao**]( **\u2013** He explains the archetypes of office workers and uses \"The Office\" TV show as a way to illustrate those lessons. If you work in an office, you must read this to better understand the people you're dealing with. And if you're a social engineer, it can help you understand and exploit those people. # The Psychology of Persuasion **Forbidden Keys to Persuasion by Blair Warren** **\u2013** This is hands down the best book on persuasion. The only downside is that somehow he's not selling it online so you have to find it elsewhere. [**Never Split the Difference by Chris Voss**]( **\u2013** A former head of the *FBI International Negotiation Team* shows how to gain the upper hand in any negotiation, without making unnecessary concessions. [**Just Listen by Mark Goulston**]( **\u2013** He was a psychologist who taught you how to stay calm in stressful situations, diffuse tension, and influence even the most difficult people. [**Digital Body Language by Erica Dhawan**]( **\u2013** Understanding people's body language and its meaning when they communicate through a screen. **Psychological Warfare** The books we've covered so far will teach you how to manipulate people and break into well-protected organizations. But this section goes much further. It explains how governments and corporations manipulate human behavior at scale. In other words, it is social engineering for the masses. [**The Lucifer Effect by Philip Zimbardo**]( **\u2013** It\u2019s a disturbing look at how power and authority can turn ordinary people into monsters. It is based on the Stanford Prison Experiment. [**This Is How They Tell Me the World Ends by Nicole Perlroth**]( **\u2013** This investigative book shows how countries use hackers for espionage, psychological operations, infrastructure sabotage, and global influence. [**Active Measures by Thomas Rid**]( **\u2013** It explains how nations have used (and still use) deception to gain more influence and power. He has researched a century of covert influence campaigns from Soviet disinformation to modern digital psychological warfare. [**How to Spot Deception, Manipulation, and Propaganda**]( I\u2019m biased because I wrote it, but this is the most practical guide in understanding and outsmarting the gifted Machiavellians. These are individuals with strong persuasion skills AND are willing to do whatever it takes to achieve their goals. In some cases, they\u2019ve the necessary resources to manipulate people on a massive scale. (Think of Edward Bernays, Steve Bannon, and Roger Ailes). So if you want to protect yourself from scammers, abusive people, and propagandists, then check it out. You can read this book for free, just set the price to $0 **More Suggestions:** * Cyber crime through social engineering by Christopher S. kayser * Unmasking The Social Engineer by Chris Hadnagy * \u201cSocial engineering - The science of influence \u201c by Yossi Dahan * How to Be Yourself by Ellen Hendriksen * Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion by Robert Cialdini * The 27 Word Sentence Persuasion Course by by Blair Warren * Aristotle: the art of rhetoric * The Art of Deception by Kevin Mitnick \\----- *Disclaimer: If you buy from the Amazon links, I get a small commission.

Even the author admitted it multiple times. That's why I haven't included it on the list. But his other books, \"The Science of SE; Human Hacking; and Unmasking the SE\" offer practical insights into social engineering. The examples of his work are generalized because his employers decide how much information he can share with the public. I think comparing him with Tai Lopez or Dan Lok is unfair. Tai Lopez and people like him trick people into thinking they are more successful than they actually are. Even the politicians constantly try to create the perception that they are more valuable than they actually are. But Hadnagy is in the cyber-security field. I don't think someone could trick for +15 years an entire community of people who are trained to be suspicious.

There are plenty of straightforward alternatives if they actually genuinely need USB devices: Use a locking device to lock the authorised devices physically in place so people can't plug in other devices. Or use adapters that makes the USB ports physically incompatible with off the shelf external devices. Or set aside quarantined machines. Basically, because of the lax security model of USB, allowing staff to plug a random USB devices they found on the street into a machine with access to the internal network is pretty close to equivalent to them letting some random stranger that approach them outside the office into the building and giving them unmonitored access to the staff members computer.

Obvious question, why? I don't know really. You only ever know what you experience and I guess I was curious. I lurk this sub a lot and I honestly thought \"where do people find these weirdos\". After this experiment, the answer turned out to be a very generic \"online\". So, let's crack on with what I learned. **Guys love their dicks and ~~want~~ need you to look at them** I knew going into it that I was going to get bombarded by various penises from around the globe but the [sheer]( [scale]( was [impressive]( Those are just the ones I wanted to screenshot, literally every word of this paragraph could be linked to a different guy. One guy was kind enough to even send me three. All of them different dicks. I think the reason behind the dick pic is that in their mind, if a girl was to send a picture of her vagina to a random guy, he'd love it, so why not return the favour? **You can get away with anything if you're hot** I do mean anything. [(1)]( Obviously those don't reflect my opinions, I just started seeing how far I could go. I spoke to him for ages and he clearly wasn't a racist, Islamophobe or anti-Semite, he just pretended to be to talk to me. Honestly, he wasn't the only one. I pretended to be incredibly stupid, a conspiracy nut and someone with genuine psychological problems. They didn't really take in anything I was saying, I was talking at them and they were just nodding in the hope that if you agree with enough of my idiotic ideas, you get rewarded with naked pictures. **I was finally popular and it was fun to start with** I posted my username on [Kikfriends]( stated that I was female, looking for men or women and looking for someone to talk to. I didn't have to wait long. Immediately, my phone was blowing up with more people eager to talk to me than I could respond to. I'd say that in my one day (well, about 12 hours) I got more than 300 messages. The stats on Kikfriends says that I have 848 views at time of writing. Now, I'm a middle of the road kind of guy. I'm not amazingly attractive, pretty introvert and have only ever handled a small group of friends. I wasn't popular in school, nor was I bottom row. But today has taught me what being popular means and, honestly, it rocked. I felt like everybody wanted to hang out with me, that saying they knew me was some sort of achievement. I had never had that before and got sucked in but then you realise why they're nice to you and it sorta breaks the magic. I went from \"look at me, come talk to me\" to wanting to be avoided. I knew that every person that messaged me had one purpose and it was soul destroying. I was no longer a person. It's hard to explain but given the content on this sub, I'm sure you're all familiar with it. **You learn to hate pet names VERY QUICKLY** I've never been one to call my girlfriend hun, babes or puddleduck or whatever. It just doesn't sit right on my tongue. It's like when teachers try to be cool, it's just so obviously forced. I never had a problem with pet names is what I'm saying, I just didn't use them. Now though, I fucking abhor them. I used a name in my profile so that I was easier to talk to. Monica is what I went with. The amount of times I was \"sexy\", \"beautiful\", \"babe\", \"hun\" or my personal worst \"bb\" (YOU'RE MISSING OUT TWO LETTERS, IT'S NOT MUCH QUICKER) is beyond count. It really started to annoy me more than it should've. What pet names like \"beautiful\" and \"sexy\" represent to me now are just words that show the guys intentions, that you're not a person, you're a body he wants to do sex on. A vessel for his seed. Literally that's all. That's by no means ground breaking but it's a recurring theme. **You get mean out of necessity** I'm not an angry person. I'm not a mean person. I can't hurt peoples feelings. Today was different. [(1)]( Now those may not seem very mean to you but I've never been that directly horrible to a person before this and it really made me feel bad. But believe it or not, it was the only way to get him to stop talking to me. Without background, I seem out of the blue mean but what you're missing is that he said it was my fault that guys were sending me dick pics (more on that in a second) and was being very chauvinistic. I told him I don't want to talk to him because we have differing opinions but he kept coming back asking me if I've ever been with a girl and if they're \"more tender\" than guys and asking my bra size and if I've done anal. I'd say \"please stop talking to me\", he'd stop for five minutes then chime in with \"whats the biggest dick you've been with?\". Where the picture start is him not talking to me for probably going on 30 minutes then out of the blue he starts telling me that his dad is annoying him or something. It was just getting too much. I'd hate to have to be mean for more than this experiment. **It's my fault that guys treat me the way they do (and it's what I want)** (I hear that Trigger Warnings are essential, so I do use the word rape here, if that upsets you, the TL;DR is I was blamed for the amount of guys not treating me as a human being because the picture I used had cleavage, feel free to skip) I started this to prove to myself that it's not as bad as it seems. I was wrong. I honestly wanted to talk to people and hoped that my being female was a small formality. I was not looking for dick pics and guys calling me a slut to screencap them and say \"ha, guys are dicks\". The picture I chose was what I would consider attractive, there was admittedly a bit of cleavage but not a lot and it was not the focus of the picture. It just happened to be there. So when I get shit like [this]( it fucking annoyed me. He meant attention I think. Over and over I'd get guys opening with \"I'm sorry\", I'd ask \"why?\", then be told that guys will be sending me pictures because my tits are out. Fuck off. Also, does this mean that if cleavage is present guys are unable to treat women as human being? 'Cause that's what I learned today. It was my fault. Heck, the girl in the picture I used has probably been raped five ways to Friday on the day that she wore that top. **You meet guys to talk to but it's hard to escape the fact that they want to see you naked** I met a few guys that I got talking to, had some pretty fun conversations it was great. Then this would happen. [(1)]( It sucked. It sucked hard. I don't actually have any words for it. I discovered the other side of the \"friend zone\". I was the girl with the guy friend who wanted to date her and *boo hoo, the guy really wants to date the girl but she's just interested in being friends and it's such a shame for the guy*. Fuck the guy, fuck the guy in his asshole. I wasn't flirty. I was me, just under the guise of being female. I talked about the football team I supported (come on you Barca), the games I liked, the shows I watched. I wasn't winking going \"will you be the Jamie to my Cercei, giggle\" but the topic of sex always came up and it was always unavoidable. I'd dismiss it like I hadn't heard him and continue as normal, as would he. Then it'd come back again and again. Once you firmly establish that you won't be talking about sex or sending them naked pictures, they get bored and most of the time [will let you know.]( **Guys have a fantasy and you don't have a choice whether to play along or not** I was pretending to be a new mother in search of a \"baby daddy\". I was poorly educated, racist and a cheat. The first time I tried that act, the guy bit. He said he'd look after me, send me money, the whole shebang. Then he started calling me a slut, a whore, sending me picture of his dick telling me that \"You love that you filthy slut\". To this point, nothing I said could've led him to think humiliation was a turn on for me. At all. Nothing. I dropped the act and asked what the fuck he was doing. His reply was \"I thought you wanted it\". It was obvious that this was his fetish and I had to play along. He wasn't even the only one. I had an encounter with a guy that wanted me to pretend he was tiny and I was to squish him? I don't know what he wanted. I'm not ridiculing that fetish, if that's what gets you off, great but I don't know anything about it. Anyway, the point was that these were forced upon me and they didn't care about it from my perspective. It goes along with the recurring theme that I'm not human to them. I'm a picture on their phone that could be a really well designed game. Say things in the correct order and you win! **Guys pretend to be girls(HOW COULD THEY)** What I mean is that countless times a woman would message me and eventually try to get picture of me. \"Could've been a lesbian\" I hear you say? Wrong. It was so very obvious that the pictures they were sending were something they ripped from 4chan or something. Anytime they'd tell me they were taking a picture for me, it'd come from their gallery. (I wasn't asking for pictures, they were insisting that if they send me something, I should send them something) Oceans Eleven-esque deception it was not. I think they genuinely believe women are all naked around each other for any amount of time. That locker rooms are like that one scene in Not Another Teen Movie, that it's a given that a girl has had a lesbian experience. It's mind numbing that they think women are so far detached from them that don't do things they do. **I gave a guy exactly what he wanted and it made me feel bad** Now, the picture of the girl I was using also came with a naked picture of her. She's a fairly obscure [Page 3 Model]( so don't feel bad that her naked picture is now out there. It was already out there. So yeah. A guy messages me with a picture of his dick and I decide to see what the end result of this is. I sent a couple other pictures (with clothing) and he obliged with more nudity, so I then dropped the naked pic on him. After what I think was him ejaculating (I'm straight but dedicated to this) we talked. We talked about where he was from, his plans for the future etc etc. Really deep shit that I think counts as pillow talk? After a long time, he started telling me that he loved me. I thought the same thing you're thinking right now, \"guys will say anything to get what they want\". So I said that to him. He then started to tell me that he's never had a girlfriend, he's really lonely and I was the first person to show interest in him and that he might not know what love feels like, but that he was feeling something. I don't know why it got to me but it crushed me. Every time I seen a dick pic I could only see this guy behind it, someone who doesn't know how to connect with women, who is lonely and someone who is otherwise a good person. I'm not sticking up for the guys who throw dicks into ~~your~~our face. I'm really not. They're wrong and need to be told so. But they're not out the be horrible, they honestly think that it's what you want, deluded as they may be. They think it'll make you like them. And that depresses me. These people won't have much luck with potential relationships and they won't know enough to know that it's their fault. They'll blame women and well, that's how /r/TheRedPill/ happened. [I'll end on a happy note. This is a serious profile picture that a guy had (censor is mine) and it makes me giggle.]( I need to go look at some puppies or something now. **I'm being flooded right now and may take some time to reply but I'll try to reply to as many people as I can**"}

I ask because, as an RPer, the entire time I was reading your post I was nodding along with it, thinking \"wow, this exactly the kind of shit TRP tries to teach men not to do.\" etc... TRP gets a bad rep for \"hating women\", and there certainly is a vocal minority of new guys there rageposting about women, but the advice given to these angry men is to own their deficiencies, improve their value, and to **not** be a needy loser begging women for sex, and to instead learn how to interact with women in a way that doesn't make them feel disgusted or creeped out (all this is often referred to as \"game\").

I read a paper in college by a female philosopher describing the 4 types of men there are when it comes to sexual harassment in interaction with females. Creepers, flirts, heroes, and allies. I strongly encourage every guy to read this because if you understand how women are being treated in these situations, you can do what you can to become the guy who is not only understanding of it but working positively to eradicate it from society, I also believe the quality of women you can attract by simply being a good person and treating them equally is much better than you can do otherwise. So please, I implore you, read this or find a sparknotes version and not only educate yourself but potentially change the way you interact with women forever. My short summation: Creepers- define the interaction as sexual before even starting to talk to the girl. She is thus powerless in existing as a human with her own feelings and goals because in his mind there is only one way he cares about the interaction going. Flirts- get to know the girl and show sexual interest without it being the main focus of the interaction, be interested in her regardless of an outcome. Just enjoying getting to know someone Heroes- think they are 'saving' the girl from a certain situation. Wouldn't exist without creepers there to make her 'in need of saving' in their mind. Allies- understand the issues women face and that they themselves unwillingly take part in societal misogyny. This understanding helps to treat women in a way that will help get rid of the inequality one day. These aren't perfect explanations but it's really worth a read."}

Girls have fragile egos and require more investment to let their guard down. They are not used to rejection. Guys on the other hand are much more used to being rejected. That said find the right niche and it's easy to find girls down for most things. For example using the moderated omegle (not unmoderated) you can find some level of success with mutual fapping with girls by having a decent body and a good sized dick. What you're doing is screening all the normal girls and looking for the ones that are horny in that moment. But everyone likes to maintain the illusion that they're not on Webcam for the opposite sex or to get sexual but most of the time they are. It's just finding the people in the right approach to protect their fragile egos and let them go with their desires. Exact same method for tinder. Incidentally, those who use tinder may use it abroad, I have no idea why people are reluctant to do this, your value is never higher than as a novelty cock for foreign women. You speak a high level of English and that is a lot of value in and of itself. Just be nice, good looking and well spoken and it's easy to get away with most things. What people don't realise is that attractive people should not 'overgame'. They come off as arrogant and even if they are bright, it doesn't add anything to the feelings of the people around you to brag about your achievements. Your looks like it or not, are achievement enough for most women. They are your Amex black card to go anywhere and do anything. That's a reality few want to confront. Women feel insecure around a man that they value much higher than themselves. And in order to unlock their ability to be free about how much they want you, you have to give them some kind of investment or plausible deniability. For guys around a high value woman it's much the same but the competition is far greater, so lower value guys have a punt a bit like it's a lottery ticket rather than a calculated use of resources. Number one rule of anything: know the odds, do more of higher probability success activities and less of lower probability success 'negative traits'"}

I got 100 times more matches than my normal profile, but I learned a few things: Once they get over the initial \"tittering\" attraction, they settle back into the same basic formula. It's a sieve: Is this guy boyfriend material, marriage material, or fuckboy material? Does he have money? Does he have social value? Is he dominant or submissive? Is he intelligent / educated? (usually educated has more value than intellect). There's a reason why most successful hiring managers are female, they can identify a quality guy much more effectively than a male can. Also, women are intimidated by attractiveness. Some normal looking women were at first bringing their A-game, but then their insecurities would leak through and they'd say \"why would someone like *you* want to talk to someone like *me*\". And that insecurity was decidedly unsexy. I would even offer to meet that same day to the ones who were very attractive and interested in me, and they would flake, hard. Another lesson: No matter how attractive you are, perverted and overtly sexual comments made *before* comfort and trust have been established are always met with negativity. Always. Here's an example conversation: Joy: Wow, you're incredibly handsome. My god, what are you doing on Tinder?? Me: I'm just interesting in spreading some Joy. :) Joy: ? okay, creepy much? However, relative to my normal profile, that would have been an instant unmatch -- but they'd just drop the conversation at that point. Sometimes I'd get a message a day or two later, \"Hey, what's up?\" As if they'd forgotten that I was a creep. Lessons learned: Be confident. Be aggressive but NOT overtly sexual at the onset. Don't take bullshit, and take the high ground often. Be direct in your intentions, but again, not overtly sexual. \"I'm taking you out this Friday.\" the response is almost always \"oh really? :) not even asking? Sure, why not.\" Relationships between men and women are a negotiation for power and control. The presumption is that men wield the power, but women have control. If you take control from the beginning, it works amazing wonders."}

A lot of the better looking guys have learned that rather than spending time and effort uniquely tailoring and crafting a beautiful response they have to capitalise on how horny the gone wild poster is. A 2% success rate is still a success rate for them. So they show their goods and then wait for the girl who's interested to reply back. There's the law of reciprocity at work as well because if the guise you have is off a gw poster the guy would have to be comfortable being naked too, in order that they can mutually swap pics, Skype and more. There's a specific subreddit for Webcam advice for omegle and chatrandom and so on about how to seduce women on it. The learned behaviour the guys demonstrate may be a successful low effort strategy for the alphas in the group. The value derived from the interaction is what gets them off. Not just the body. Now here's the strange thing, losers may also adopt the same mindset as winners and as such either degrade the strategy (nudes4nudes) or entirely put off the person they're trying to connect with (thus fucking it up for all involved). It's still not the same as approaching cold and if they're comfortable with the size of their cock they might think that's enough in lieu of any decent attempt at seduction."}

When the same members then began to speak less, lead more, work out and focus on their bodies, skills, interests, and hobbies, and be clear in their sexual intent, suddenly it was like a switch had been flipped in how girls responded.

You can challenge either of these two assertions or you can make the case that being a sex object is preferential treatment. It's a free country."}

I agree that the ability to wield dark triad tools against manipulative assholes at will is a strength and one that takes effort for any non-dark triad person, abused or not, to master. Ruthlessly sexy bitches are often Machiavellian schemers because they want rewards for their efforts and scheming is all they focus on, but that's them. TRP tends to go for only the 10s in the looks department. Their biases drive their other biases. Adopting dark triad skills will help an abused man subjugate a ruthlessly sexy woman with entitlement issues but why bother. It's cruel to use those skills on non dark triads, it just makes the world a nastier place instead of putting nasty people in their place. I'd rather not train myself to be a dark triad in order to fuck other dark triads, but that's me.

We've all been in that relationship with someone you don't really have much in common with but you fuck like rabbits, so what does it matter? A lot, as it turns out, because it always ends the same way. Have sex when you want to and don't use it as a weapon or reward. If both of you aren't enjoying sex, then you're either doing it wrong or need to consult a doctor. * Similar goals If you don't want the same things then you'll grow to resent your partner, that's just an unfortunate fact of life. It could be something as big as wanting/not wanting kids, to a wanderlust or even career ambition. It doesn't matter but you need to see eye to eye on the big picture.

It's not too difficult actually, because there's a difference between knowing someone's personality and knowing their stories. Funny stories are perfect for this because the focus isn't on you, it's on the joke. So for instance, you can go and tell people dozens of different jokes and funny situations and then they can feel they've listened to you for ages and therefore must know your personality. But while they did listen to stories about you, those stories would have been nearly identical if you substituted anyone else in your place, so they actually haven't learnt anything of substance about *you*and your personality. You can also give them loads of facts and statistics about you (and keep it from being boring by packaging it nicely in a joke/funny story).

I don't know you, so I may be off the mark and I'm going to ask a few questions. If any of this is patronizing I apologize, but again I don't know how you normally behave haha. When you speak passionately is it about things that you *actually* care about, or think you '*should*' care about? I only ask this as feigned passion can subtly come across as insincere, which can then translate as aggression (if you're vocal). An example of how forcing emotions doesn't work is when we receive presents we hate. No matter how much we pretend to love it, people can always tell. If it is something you are actually passionate about maybe you need to read the room beforehand. True passion can play on people's insecurities (which you won't always know) and they can see this as an attack. For example: Imagine you and a friend have both bought cars. Yours is better. When parked side by side you go on a passionate monologue about how amazing your car is and everything it can do. At the end of this your friend is visibly annoyed. Why? In your friend's mind, you have read your surroundings and have seen that his car is worse, so your tirade about your amazing car isn't to show positive attributes about your own; it's to demean his car. Unfortunately a lot of people have this negative mindset and how you spoke during the conversation can make you come across as aggressive as a combination. About the avoiding conflict: What kind of conflict do you mean? Things like someone stepping on your shoelace? People pronouncing your name wrong? Ignoring you when you try to speak? Being mean to you? Physically assaulting you? etc I can't say too much on this until it's a but clearer."}

Just look up pay scale for Kroger, Fred Meyer, Stater Brothers, Albertson's, etc. Glass Door has examples. I'd also tell you that most Costco workers work less than 35 hours, to which of course you'd ask for another citation. Look all that shit up yourself if you're actually interested, unless you want to make a bet on any of that info and pay me when I prove it. Prove it like I did with the other info you didn't believe. Costco starts at 11.50 and tops out at 21.50. Not bad for entry level work, but if it wasn't for Teamsters, they wouldn't have that. Because they're partly organized, if Costco paid anything less, Teamsters would organize a strike on all of Costco. My SO got a fuck ton of OT, so she ended up making over 50K, but that's because she was a supervisor. She's was pretty much over Costco after a few years of it, and finding out the max she'd get paid is less than many other jobs where she'd get every Sat and Sun off, not get called in on her days off, or at least go beyond the top out pay."}

An Extensive Guide to Russian Social Engineering Techniques and How To Counter Them.", "content": "There was a vital invention that has saved tens of millions of human lives throughout history \u2014 soap and hygiene. The simple ritual of washing hands stopped the spreading of deadly diseases and allowed humankind to make a gigantic leap. To survive now, we need to introduce to our everyday life another crucial ritual \u2014 \u201cwashing our thoughts\u201d, that helps us to see and dispose of thoughts propaganda tries to implement. We could see another age of dictatorships and wars if we don\u2019t. How to do it? There is a trick in countering propaganda: if you can name and understand how a technique is intended to influence your mind, it will not work on you. And we live in the \u201cblissed\u201d times when almost a whole country provides the world with tons of selected propaganda. Let\u2019s examine Russian propaganda\u2019s methods and how to avoid getting on its hook. #### 1) \u201cRotten Fish\u201d If you repeat something disgusting about someone, whether true or not, it \u201csticks\u201d to that person/country. A good example is a statement regarding nazi/nationalistic groups in Ukraine. Russia doesn\u2019t aim to prove this; it only wants that there was a discussion, defenders and attackers for this thesis. As a result, if the person stands near a rotten fish for too long, the smell sticks to them, and the person becomes unconsciously associated with the idea. I am amazed at how it works because it is complete bullshit for me, and I would never think somebody would believe it. I have lived in different parts of Ukraine: Eastern, Western, and Central, but I have never seen at least half of a nazi in person. However, I met people from Germany, Serbia, and other countries that believed it. &#x200B; #### 2) \u201c60/40\u201d 60% of truth and 40% of lies. Create a media that deliver truthful information, but after establishing trust and the audience, starts to incept propagandistic messages. In WWII, Goebbels created an \u201canti-nazi\u201d radio station that successfully existed and served nazis until the war\u2019s end. Only after the audience found out it was nazi propaganda. Channel \u201cRussia Today\u201d could be an excellent example of leveraging such a principle. #### 3) \u201cCreation of a dragon\u201d A common enemy unites a group and can be blamed for any calamities the group suffers. Finding an absolute enemy is sewn into our unconsciousness with hundreds of fairytales about knights, dragons, Saurons, etc. Russia leverages it by making USA and NATO the dragon. In Ukraine, we mock it like: \u201cOh, that was Biden and Zelensky who corrupted the Russian government, littered on the streets, and turned so many people into alcoholics\u201d. Why does this technique work? Usually, it works on people that don\u2019t take responsibility for their lives and are used to blaming others. It\u2019s always easier to accuse someone than work hard on improving one\u2019s life. Another factor \u2014 is a lack of critical thinking. If people are told by TV that Russia\u2019s adversaries are because of the USA/masons/Jews, bothering with analysis of the actual cause-and-effect relationships of this thesis could result in catastrophic consequences \u2014 the need to make independent actions and choices, which is extremely scary! So, it\u2019s better to have a dragon. #### 4) \u201cCreation of a saviour\u201d If you have a dragon, you need a prince or \u201cthe saviour\u201d who will \u201cprotec, attac and provide snacks\u201d. By creating a strong image (only image), Putin leverages this method to get the loyalty of not only Russians but also people abroad. The mechanism of this technique is the same: if a person doesn\u2019t want to work hard and transform their life, they or will start looking for the saviour who could do it for them. The whole USSR ideological machine had successfully leveraged this method for 90 years, and you could find a lot of other entities that use it. The thing is that \u201csalvation\u201d always stays on the mythological level \u2014 the promise of the Lost Paradise is never fulfilled. #### 5) \u201cA very big lie\u201d Confidently stating something so unlogical and blatant that a person willy-nilly starts to believe it \u2014 people refuse to believe that anyone can lie so shamelessly. A good example is Russia\u2019s statement that USA and Ukraine are developing biologically modified birds for spreading diseases in Russia. The crucified child in Donbas goes to that pool also. #### 6) \u201cPower Signalling\u201d Similar to the big lie, but perceives another aim and audience. Stating some complete rubbish always sends a signal like \u201cI can do whatever I want, and you can change nothing\u201d. The goal of such informational overload with fiction stories about biolabs, children\u2019s crucifixions and nazis are to subconsciously persuade intelligent people in Russia that they can\u2019t change anything. As someone said: \u201cThe true goal of propaganda is not to persuade you but to make you do nothing\u201d. The power signalling also works for an external audience: \u201csee how much control I have over my population! I can feed them lies that are obvious for the whole world to see!\u201d ### 7) Their Majesty \u201cWhataboutism\u201d My favourite one. It aims to redirect the attention from accusing to self-justification. For example, if somebody mentions Bucha or Mariupol massacres, a Russian can counter it with smth like: \u201cAnd what has the USA done to Iraq?\u201d. So, two things happen. Somebody others sin is used to justify their own, which it doesn\u2019t. And the attention is driven from the central thesis to another country and other times. \u201cMoral Equivalence\u201d is one of the whatoubatism variations. Popular with Nazi apologists and holocaust deniers. The argument is that X is bad, BUT everyone does it. For example, soldiers in every army have killed POWs and civilians and committed rape, so why pick on the poor Russians? #### 8) Brandolini\u2019s law (Bullshit symmetry principle) It is an internet adage that emphasises the effort of debunking misinformation compared to the relative ease of creating it in the first place. It states, \u201cThe amount of energy needed to refute bullshit is an order of magnitude bigger than that needed to produce it.\u201d Russians leverage it by creating many crazy narratives: biolabs, nazi, Ukrainians bombing Donbas, Poland wanting to conquer the west of Ukraine, Ukraine wanting to attack Russia\u2026 You see, you could get a bit tired just by reading this sentence. Thanks a redditer u/Ok-Yogurtcloset-6740 for providing info on this technique. Another example by u/LuukR on how Russians tried to shift responsibility for the MH17 catastrophe. First, they claimed that Ukrainian jets shut down MH17 even though those jets couldn\u2019t reach that altitude (they edited Wikipedia to support their claim). Then Ukrainian SAMs supposedly shut down MH17 even though it was clearly proven that it was a specific BUK rocket that only Russia possessed. And finally, the CIA put a bomb inside the plane because\u2026 it is always the CIA. Often Brandolini\u2019s law is paired with the Gish Gallup, whose goal is to overwhelm an opponent with a stream of true or false arguments to put out so many your opponent can\u2019t refute everything. Thanks, u/FlatBlueSky for explaining that. #### 9) \u201cThe firehose of falsehood\u201d It is similar to Brandolini\u2019s law. Basically throwing bullshit at the wall in the hope that some of it will stick, with no regard for verifiability, realism, or % of the truth, just massed claims pulled out of a vatnik\u2019s ass. If you try to combat it, by the time you debunk one lie, 20 more will take its place, so the only feasible option is to tune it out entirely, at which point vatniks complain that they wanted an honest discussion, but you don\u2019t. The goal isn\u2019t to build any self-consistent false narrative because it\u2019s hard to get enough consistency. Instead, the goal is to throw out such a massive number of narratives that the truth gets buried. Then everyone latches onto the narrative that has the most emotional appeal to them personally. Thanks for that u/KlaatuBaradaN-word. Scientific research that reinforces this technique is that lies spread faster than truth: [ #### 10) \u201cDivide and Conquer\u201d Old as the world, seeding distrust and dislike between allies by, e.g. posing as one while overzealously criticising another. Thanks, u/einalex for highlighting this one. I.e., Russia accused Poland of preparing to invade the west of Ukraine. Creating many videos on Europe that \u201cis freezing without Russia\u201d to undermine Europe\u2019s support of democracy. #### 11) \u201cStrong and weak enemy\u201d Another widespread one, fascists used this a lot: The enemy is both weak and strong simultaneously. So, it is OK to insult and call them derogatory names; they are nothing compared to their own country/race. But at the same time, these \u2018weak\u2019 others also threaten our culture/country/safety. Using this, Russia can display Ukraine as a state that shouldn\u2019t be there/is just little Russia AND as a den of lethal neo-nazi wanting to eat Russian babies. They can adjust the frame/argument according to what is needed at that particular moment. Thanks, u/LLLLLdLLL, for providing thoughts on that. #### 12) Radicalisation Much propaganda is built on a kernel of truth. That makes people more likely to believe the rest of the message alongside the truth. \u201cX is not perfect \u2014 we can prove this \u2014 therefore, X is the worst possible thing and is the enemy.\u201d You see this in purposeful propaganda efforts and even in ordinary people posting on social media. \u201cThis group didn\u2019t do exactly what I think they should, so let\u2019s hate everything about them!!! We must oppose them!\u201d Credits to u/ChairsAndFlaff for providing information on that. Example: Russia has conducted an excellent campaign using this technique in Germany. They published many articles on Ukrainian \u201cnationalism\u201d and \u201cantisemitism\u201d in influential German media during 2014\u201315. The topic was about a political party, \u201cSvoboda\u201d, some members of which made few antisemitic statements, and Russia started to trumpet \u201cnazis in Ukraine\u201d. The truth is those were very few members of that party, which itself got only around 5% of the seats in our parliament. The party members didn\u2019t have a lot of support and were mostly perceived as chatterboxes and populists. As a result, they didn\u2019t get any seats during our next elections. #### 13) \u201cTruth Relativism\u201d It is impossible to prove anything with absolute certainty, so nothing can be proved. For instance, Oryx must be wrong because the figures cannot be verified completely. This type of argument is popular with Covid deniers, flat earthers and those who think the moon landing was faked. There are degrees of wrongness, so we can discuss degrees of truth. Russia leverages it in narratives like \u201cyou can\u2019t stay with confidence that wasn\u2019t Ukrainians in Bucha / it wasn\u2019t staged\u201d and so on. Even some pretty direct evidence, like satellite images, still can be \u201crelevant\u201d from the point of view of the Russian propagandists. #### 14) \u201cVictimhood\u201d This changes the narrative to make the people of Russia seem to be the real victims. \u201cIt\u2019s Russian people suffering the most because they \u201chave to\u201d follow their dictator\u201d. Though, it\u2019s not Putin who kills civilians, shells energy infrastructure and posts requests to destroy Ukrainians on local Russian social media. For the previous two, and \u201cmoral equivalence, I thank u/One_Cream_6888 **15) \u201cSealioning\u201d** A subtle form of trolling involving \u201cbad-faith\u201d questions. You disingenuously frame your conversation as a sincere request to be enlightened, placing the burden of educating you entirely on the other party. If your bait is successful, the other party may engage, painstakingly laying out their logic and evidence in the false hope of helping someone learn. In fact, you are attempting to harass or waste the other party\u2019s time and have no intention of truly entertaining their point of view. Instead, you react to each piece of information by misinterpreting it or requesting further clarification ad nauseum. Russian trolls use this technique as a hook for engaging and starting to promote their narratives. Credits to u/briefnuts for this technique. \\*\\*\\* Propaganda is fuel for dictatorship regimes. Understanding and educating others about it undermines dictatorships and prevents their spread. Analysing and processing all the data we consume nowadays is as important as washing our hands. Stopping \u201cideological bacteria\u201d from spreading, we give the whole of humanity to survive the dictatorship pandemic and take a step toward a peaceful future and coexistence. That\u2019s why education and critical thinking will play a critical role in our survival. Thank you for reading! Those were only several of the most common propagandistic tricks; if you know more \u2014 please share in the comments. [#propaganda]( #socialengineering]( #Ukraine]( #russia]( #socialengineering"}

Sorry for my slow response, I was off Reddit for some time. This is a great observation! Yes, \"everything is lost\" can be both a technique and a result of using this technique. The goal, as you've noted is to demoralize the other side. It's often used by authoritarian regimes and leaders to make people passive \"We can't change anything\". I think, to counter it, everybody needs to concentrate on small viable steps that can change the situation at least slightly. This way it's possible to stop being demoralized. The same works with others \u2013 start proposing small steps."}

I'll mimic an actual event I saw in the afternoon yesterday, but add this twist to the conversation. So to setup the scene, it's a fast food restaurant in the early afternoon on a hot day. We have a very enthusiastic dude we'll call Derick and an unenthusiastic fast food supervisor we'll call Annie. Annie is busy trying to keep up with drive-through and supervising the floor staff. Derick can tell she's busy, multitasking, and sets himself a goal. Derrick bypasses the order line, approaches where food is given to customers (and people usually go with questions/complaints) and he points up at a display for a new seasonal product. It's an outrageous product that screams MURICA. The Cheetos encrusted Mac'n'Cheese Bite. > Derick: What *is* that? Annie: It's a Cheetos Mac'n'Cheese Bite. Derick: *Really?* That's crazy. No *way*. Who would think of something like that? Annie: Corporate. Derick: No way! That's nuts. Is it *good*? Now, at this point, Derick is trying to manipulate Annie into offering him a free sample. You see, Derick doesn't have any money on him, came in with a friend who is in line buying a bunch of something super cheap, and both guys look like they're probably recently released ex-cons. They seem nice enough, though. Derick's friend is ultra-chill and mostly is trying not to draw attention to himself. Derick on the other hand is trying to leverage enthusiasm, questioning, etc, to \"offer an opportunity\" to the supervisor to push a new product. In the real world, Annie ignored this. The manipulation failed. Derick rubs his head, affects that he's still blown away by the seasonal offering, and follows his friend out. No doubt upset on some level that his attempt to manipulate failed. The enthusiasm trick (show enthusiasm, be friendly, present no threat, etc) often works for people. Derick was just a *tad* over-dramatic about it and did it in a place that cares more about sales than advertising. The same trick at a local business will often net you a sample. So let's have Annie flip it by clarifying goals. > Annie: You trying for a sample? [Friendly grin.] Derick: Daw, you got me. [Hangs head dramatically.] This establishes that Annie knows what Derick is up to, and Derick plays it off. Now they're on totally even footing. Derick will see that Annie is paying attention and is on the level, but she hasn't denied him. Now Annie has two options, deny him and he knows he was caught, or give into the manipulation so as not to sour Derick's mood. > Annie: Hey Sarah? [To the register.] Comp this guy some bites, I'll swipe it in. Sarah: Got it. Derick: Oh, sweet! Thanks! Now you might ask, why would Annie choose this path? Derick could or could not be a customer in the future and it's clear he likes to talk to people. He is enthusiastic. He will remember when someone does him a solid, and because he knows he didn't get something for free due to manipulation but *because he was forced to realize someone chose to give it to him*, he will be more likely to return the favor. No doubt he'll spend the next two days talking about the Cheetos Mac'n'Cheese bite to anyone who will listen. He'll also mention that the supervisor over at the fast food restaurant is sharp and will catch you. This reduces the rate of similar incidents, depending on the size of the community around it. It may also net you more sales. The way this clarification works changes based on the nature of the manipulator, the manipulation, the situation, etc."}

WARNING: Wall of text, but worth the read!", "content": "When I was eighteen years old I got my very first job at a video retail store called I will not name. It was probably my favorite job I've ever had. In 2001, I stole my very first DVD which was \"From Hell\" starring Johnny Depp (side note: TERRIBLE MOVIE). I stole it by taking it into the employee bathroom, slicing it open with a razor, and removing the security tag (DVDs have these black/white strips inside that will trigger an alarm if they are not deactivated). I would then stuff the DVD in my pants and request to go buy a drink (in which I would really go to my car, first). Why did I do this? I wanted to see the movie, it looked interesting in the previews and I didn't have the money to purchase it (at the time, my parents forced me to deposit my paychecks into a savings account\u2026 all of it, I was allowed no money for myself). I didn't experience any kind of thrill from stealing, I just really wanted to see the movie so I took it. No thought of \"stealing is wrong\" entered my head. I know it's wrong in the sense of the law, but for some reason, I did not care. This kind of stealing evolved the next couple of years when I got a few of my friends involved. Usually it would go like this: * Wait until Monday when it was just me and the General Manager. 3:30pm, the General Manager would go on a conference call in the back room for a mandatory one hour meeting. * During this time, I would call in my friends and they would collect all of the DVDs they wanted, bring them to the counter where I was working, and I would promptly begin to deactivate them. In exchange for this, they would collect DVDs I wanted. * Once completed I would do a \"fake transaction\" in case there were other customers in the store and pretend to take a credit card. * After the fake transaction my friends would leave the store and I would retrieve my \"bag\" at a later time. This operation went on for at least two years and I amassed a collection of over 1000 DVDs as a result. None of the customers in the store question these blue collar people buying what looked to be hundreds of dollars worth of DVDs every Monday. At no point in time did I ever feel remorse of any kind for ripping off this company by the THOUSANDS. In fact, it was a good feeling for me that I had amassed such an impressive collection of films. You're probably wondering if my parents noticed this collection. To be quite honest with you, I am not sure. I kept my collection really well hidden at first, but eventually I stopped caring. My parents never said a word to me about it. At the store I worked in, one had the ability to reserve a DVD if it was set to be released in the future. One customer in who I will call Cornelius, was some rich guy who used to come in and order them by the dozens and pay for them in full. I was his favorite employee since we had similar tastes in films and I liked to hear about his exploits in his business (he was a high ranking \"problem solver\" for some world-wide corporation). So he used to always reserve films when I was at the register (this also helped keep me employed there since employees had a quota that needed to be filled). One day, when he was picking up his reserves I happened to notice that I accidentally overcharged him a reserve (something like $22.99 instead of $19.99). You take reserve tickets in the register the same way as a coupon, and usually if a customer used a coupon the went over the price of the DVD it would just omit the change (for obvious reasons). At first, I thought it was going to omit the change, but this was different. Because Mr. Harms had pre-paid (pre-paid being the key word) he was entitled to change so new options appeared \"Cash or credit\", so when I hit cash, the register opened and I was able to give him money back. After this instance, the wheels began to turn in my head. I learned that it was potentially possible to remove cash from the register without a shortage appearing on the end of the night report. But first, I needed to learn what exactly the manager does at the end of the night. So for a few weeks (I usually always closed) I watched intently what kind of reports are printed out and what the manager actually accounts for. What I noticed was rather alarming, but beneficial to my cause. My General Manager only checked the cash totals, he didn't even count up the credit card totals to make sure those were correct. He also had a list of reservation certificates redeemed (the ones that I will soon use to take money out of the register) that he just signed off on that he checked and they were ok. After that, he would rubber band all of the reports together, write the date on them, and throw them carelessly into a plastic bin. Once the bin was full, they were discarded in the trash. So once every 90 days they were discarded, helping my cause even further. I kept this entirely to myself and told absolutely no one. In fact, as I type this, this is the first time I have ever disclosed this information. So this started out with me writing up a fake reservation tickets, usually for the amount of 49.99 and then using that to redeem an equally fake 29.99 DVD so I'd get an easy $20. It should be noted that there was no real way to inventory reservations since you could redeem these tickets at ANY OF THE STORES IN THE USA. Just like my DVD stealing scam I still had going, this evolved from me doing the $20 scam I just described to a whopping $120 scam every shift I worked. I worked there five days a week since I sold the most reservations. Sometimes I would do two $120 scams in a row. The $120 scam was me redeeming a $120 reserve on a $1.00 bottle of pop we had in the store. At the end of the night, I would glance at the closing paperwork and see these outrageous dollar amounts in the reserves. But true to form, the managers never checked and signed off on it blindly. This was mostly due to the fact because the closing managers lived considerably far from the store and wanted to leave as quickly as possible. I had this scam going strong for the next year and a half. I was literally making $600-$700 a week from the cash scam in the register. That's the equivalent of making almost $34,000 a year in addition to the measly $6.50 an hour I was receiving. You're probably wondering how no one saw me do this in the store, someone HAD to have seen me pocket all of this money!! I only really did this when the store of devoid of customers (which was frequent back in 2003/2004) and honestly, my General Manager was not an intelligent man. He was a very nice guy, just lacked any kind of common sense. Me, on the other hand, I am very observant and calculating. You're also probably assuming the corporate office had copies themselves of these reports at the end of the night with OUTRAGEOUS totals in the reservation redeems. Another thing on my side was the fact the company who owned the retail stores I worked at changed hands three times in this year and a half period. Even when the company settled in under the new owners I still went undetected. It was a stupid mistake on my part that led to my downfall. Even before this event I will explain a safety plan I devised. I want you to know that I am a neurotic over-thinker. I over-think everything, it's a serious problem I have but it is beneficial in certain things. Such as my work scams. There were times I wanted to stop the cash scam because I knew I would have been found out inevitably (just not very quickly) but the money was too good and I was an underachiever in my youth. So I started to develop a contingency plan should the inevitable day come where I am caught. I actually was interview by the Loss Prevention Detective for the company about a year prior to my scam being found out over something unrelated. So I saw how the man conducted himself in the interrogation, however I knew he was not looking for me. I researched how interrogators work and their various tactics to get criminals to \"crack.\" One of the most commonly used techniques is the \"Loaded Question Tactic.\" I will attempt to explain: A loaded question is a question which contains an unjustified assumption (e.g. , a presumption of guilt). Loaded questions are logical fallacies in themselves and typically used as rhetorical tools: the question attempts to limit direct replies to be those that serve the questioner's agenda. Example: The question \"Have you stopped beating your wife?\" presupposes that you have beaten your wife prior to its asking, as well as that you have a wife. If you are unmarried, or have never beaten your wife, then the question is loaded. Since this example is a yes/no question, there are only the following two direct answers: 1. \"Yes, I have stopped beating my wife\", which entails \"I was beating my wife.\" 2. \"No, I haven't stopped beating my wife\", which entails \"I am still beating my wife.\" The proper way to answer that loaded question would be to say \"I have never beaten my wife.\" But most people are stupid and would fall for it which would lead the interrogator into more questions until you inevitably crack. I was determined to not let this happen to me. Another thing, we did not have personal codes when ringing up something in the register, it was just open to anyone to use so you couldn't personally track who rang what. I knew it would be easy to connect the dots once I was found out but it would still be circumstantial without a confession. So without further adieu, let me explain how this came to an end for me. October 19, 2004, I made a grave mistake when I was at work. I needed some extra cash so I could go on a trip to Minnesota with a few friends. It was unusually busy (there were three big releases that week if I remember correctly), and I was finding it difficult to conduct my cash scam. Mainly because there were A LOT of customers around and it was just me and the General Manager. I didn't explain this before, but the cash scam takes one minute (minimum) to complete. I had to fill out a reserve ticket and then conduct the register operation\u2026 and our registers were OLD, like late 1980s DOS based computers OLD OLD OLD so that also meant SLOW SLOW SLOW. Sometimes, what I would do is conduct the scam, but retrieve the cash later (if it was busy). However, this particular day was so outrageously busy I conducted the scam but could not remember if I removed the cash from the drawer since I already had a large amount of case in my pocket. In retrospect, I should have taken it anyway because a $120 overage is loads more suspect than a shortage (think about it) but I opted to leave it. At the end of the night, sure enough, the drawer was $120 over and my General Manager was freaking the fuck out. But to my surprise he didn't troubleshoot by checking the report\u2026 he still signed off on EVERYTHING and figured he'd just get \"yelled at and it would blow over.\" So I was naturally relieved by his ignorance. I had the next day off, but I worked the day after that with my General Manager again. I asked him if he got into a lot of trouble and he simply said \"No.\" But it wasn't a suspicious \"no.\" So I carried on as always (I still needed the extra cash for my Minnesota trip). So I conducted my cash scam without a hitch and I figured everything would be ok. This would not prove to be the case. At the end of the night, I noticed my General Manager was VERY CAREFULLY looking at the register tape (the records of every single transaction for the day) and he abruptly stopped at one and highlighted it. Needless to say, this freaked me the fuck out but I opted to stay calm and continue my work. [Continued here]("}

Also, I requested the next few days off (about a month beforehand) I didn't tell them where I was going or what I was doing. If I remember correctly, I phrased it as I had to work on a school project (I'm not that dumb) but I was really going to Minnesota on a fishing trip. After three days passed, I came back to work and ohhhhhh man were things instantly different. This other part-time employee looked SCARED TO DEATH at the register so I asked her what was wrong. She told me a loss prevention detective was in the store and he wanted to interview every employee. I played it off like everything was ok, but I knew\u2026 I knew this was the day I was mentally preparing for\u2026 the inevitable interrogation. So I clocked in and went about my work routine when suddenly the General Manager comes out of the office and pulls me aside and tells me I need to talk to the LP Detective. I ask what it's about, and he just says \"he wants to talk to everyone.\" But I knew, I was the main event for this LP Detective. I'm basically SHOVED into the backroom and this Cliff Huxtable sweater wearing guy smiles at me, introduces himself, and politely asks me to sit down. His opening statement went something like: LP Detective: Hell there tweakofnature, I'm (I forgot his name), I work for the Loss Prevention Department of (whatever the corporations name was that owned the store I worked in). I'm here today conducting an investigation and I just need some basic information from you. He asked me my full name, date of birth, and how long I worked for the store. I answered him truthfully. He then asked me my personal definition of theft. To which I answered \"Taking something that doesn't belong to you.\" Meanwhile, as I am looking around the room, there are numerous old reports sprawled about with my cash scam transactions highlighted. Also several old employee schedules attempting to link me. I knew he was trying to fuck with me at this point, he knew it was me, he just needed me to say so otherwise he didn't have a case (gotta love that word \"circumstantial\")\u2026 so I decided to play right back. Normally, the interrogator will ask personal questions such as \"what you aspire to be?\" Normally the perp would answer honestly and then the questioning would take a more negative turn in an attempt to break the suspect for example: He did ask me: \"So what did you aspire to be when you were young?\" (career wise) If I had answered honestly with \" I wanted to be a filmmaker\" he most likely (speculative on my part) would have taken the questioning to either \"Looks like you just didn't cut it, right?\" or \"You probably need a lot of money to finance a film.\" Instead, I chose a different route, one to aggravate this man. I simply answered his questions WITH QUESTIONS. It went like this for a while: **LP Detective** : What did you aspire to be? **tweakofnature** : How long have you worked for (store name)? **LP Detective** : Have you ever stolen anything before? **tweakofnature** : Have you ever given anything away before? **LP Detective** : Do you ever get angry? **tweakofnature** : Have you ever been happy? He starts to get real irritated with me and accuses me of not being cooperative, to which I apologize for making him mad (which pisses him off more). Now here's where the Loaded questions come. He literally phrased it like this: **LP Detective**: \"tweakofnature, I'm going to ask you a loaded question, do you know what that is?\" (I lie and say I don't) **LP Detective**: \"It's just like a normal question, but it's one that I already know the answer to!\" **tweakofnature**: Ok\u2026? **LP Detective**: \"Have you committed any form of theft this week?\" Here are the facts up to this point: * All of the evidence he had against me was entirely empirical and circumstantial; nothing concrete. * No one witnessed me doing these things I was being accused of. * He could connect the dots and see that the same dollar amount was taken on only days that I worked leading to a conclusion that it was most likely me, but alas; no concrete evidence\u2026 just conjecture. * I was always quiet and kept to myself at work, I never told anyone (not even my best friend) what I was doing. Most of the time when people steal money, they gloat about shit they bought with it. I knew that was not a smart move so I said nothing. * The General Manager and the Assistant Manager were in financial turmoil at the time, and I knew I could pawn the investigation onto them. I told the LP Detective\u2026 YES! That I had committed theft that week. He looked surprised by my admission of guilt. He then asked \"Could you describe what you did.\" I told him \"I stole three DVDs\", and went on to tell him that \"I knew that secret shopper spotted me and I've felt guilty ever since^1.\" His demeanor changed to what I can only describe as horrific confusion. He tripped over his words and said \"Oh\u2026 okay, okay!\" He asked me if that was my first time and I said yes because they cut our hours (which was true) and I had to cut corners in my budget. It was obvious he did not want to pursue this petty theft and wanted to bring the conversation back around to the cash scam. So he asked \"Thank you for your honesty, tweakofnature, now have you done any other types of theft?\" I asked him what he meant, and he said \"Did you ever maybe take any money out of the drawer?\" (notice: I mind-fucked him in such a way he forgot about the loaded questions). I told him never and that it was impossible, WOULDN'T THE DRAWER BE SHORT??? Then this stupid asshole decided to explain my own cash scam to me and I just pretended like I didn't understand it. He tried placating and ego I didn't have by saying \"If you think about it, this scam is rather ingenious!\" I just kept telling him I didn't understand how it could work. So he explained it probably three times and that's when I brought up \"Wouldn't this have shown up on a report?\" His face went to hard scowl and he just said \"maybe someone wasn't doing their job correctly.\" So now he tries scaring me by describing these hidden cameras they sometimes put into stores that are the size of a pin head. Before he even finished I flat out asked him \"Do you have me on video doing this?\" and he responds \"Are you sure you want me to answer that?\" DUMBEST THING YOU COULD HAVE SAID SHIT-FOR-BRAINS, you might as well have said no. So I answered sarcastically with \"Yes, I want to see something impossible.\" He gives me another scowl\u2026 this mother fucker is losing the battle, and he knows it. He ends up calling the police to report my theft and exits the back room telling me not to leave. He ends up coming in and out of the backroom intermittently trying to get me to confess to the money scam, but I remain tight lipped. Eventually the Police show up and ask where the merchandise is that I allegedly stole. They thought it was this big box of DVDs on the ground (we had a new shipment that needed to be put out on the floor). When the LP Detective told them that it wasn't the Cops stood there confused. This LP Detective didn't even have me write anything down or sign anything, however I did personally confess to him, but he couldn't prove it. After arguing with the cops, they pretty much tell him that they can't arrest me without some form of evidence. He tells them that I confessed, but ardently deny confessing anything and accuse him of trying to wrap up an open LP case. Eventually the cops tell him that they aren't arresting me and criticize how he does his job. Completely embittered and defeated, the LP Detective takes one look at me and tells me to leave the store and never come back. To which my reply was only: \"But why? I didn't do anything wrong!\" His face turned bright red, I got up from my seat and exited the store and I never returned. I heard several months later he was terminated (not because of me) because he royally fucked up another interrogation at a different store. I apologize if there are any grammar/spelling errors. Once I started typing, I simply could not stop. Thank you for reading. ^1 - I did that solely to fuck with him. He wasn't recording anything I was saying but merely writing it down. And if he wanted me to sign anything I would have refused and requested a lawyer. **TL;DR** : I stole over $30,000 from a retail job I had in 2003/2004 and after I was caught I outsmarted everyone and got away scott-free"}

Even the most basic analysis would have shown the anomalies. If the detective had simply silently recorded a month before confronting, you'd have been cooked. Circumstantial? I don't think you understand that. If there was ever a time when only were there there or if the other person had a documented alibi (being on a conf. call with corporate), and a scam tx occured -- that's no longer circumstantial. That's a solid log and evidence. Fuck, people have gone to prison on far less: Seriously, they knew it was you, but instead of collecting more solid evidence, *or even trying to properly reconstruct what they had* they bomb the entire store and destroy any possibility of finding out. W.T.F. Had they fixed their evidence, they could have filed charges without fuckface trynna act like Clint Eastwood. Real charges, at court, or pursued by a DA - very different story. I ask this: How did you *know* that the LP guy was going to be a moron? What if someone of nearly your IQ had run the investigation? Did you somehow check into this beforehand and know corp would send a fuckwit? Your story mentions nothing about trying to cover up evidence. (For instance, sneaking in while off-duty, distracting the on-duty people, and running a scam - thus ensuring your lawyer could say \"see, this happened multiple times when my client was not there\".) It's a sweet story, and it's fairly impressive, and I love and respect this kind of stuff. How you manipulated the detective is awesome. But you had a lot of luck/incompetence involved.

Thanks for sharing that link, it was... interesting. Before I was interviewed by the LP Detective, he was sent to the store I worked at a few different times because there were other employees who did truly stupid shit without thinking. For example, they would steal entire gaming consoles! I saw how he operated numerous times and I even asked the employees who were let go how he went about the interrogation process. What I gauged from this LP Detective is that he was extremely arrogant and thought he was smarter than everyone. Even beforehand when he would interview all of the employees just to see if we could add to the dipshit stealing the game console he was very cocky. I remembered these things when I was mentally preparing for my exit strategy. As for the General Manager, he is a very nice man (and we're even friends to this day) but he lacks all kinds of common sense and critical thinking. I'm not exactly sure what he was thinking. We hang out every so often but he never brings up \"the incident with tweakofnature.\" If I snuck in off-duty... I dunno, that doesn't sound like a very good idea. It was a public store with people in it at all times. I looked into retail laws and the only way you can truly get busted is if they have you on camera committing these acts... or unless you're dumb enough to confess. Also, I agree with you... the only reason I got away with it is because my GM and the LP Detective were highly incompetent."}

Admittedly Reddit makes it confusing by calling it \"karma\" and saying \"x% like it\" next to the score for the post. An upvote is not meant to be the \"like\" button on Facebook. By default, the system sorts posts and comments by number of upvotes. If you downvote something, you're making it less likely that someone else will see it. Since the entire point of Reddit is to share content, downvoting *only* because you disagree with something is defeating the point. Downvote if it's worthless and you think it should never again see the light of day. I personally think the OP's actions were wrong, but it was an interesting read and I think it's worthwhile for other people to read too, so I upvoted it. If something is high quality content yet really bothers you, you can always upvote but then add a (well-written, constructive) reply explaining your feelings, or don't vote at all and move on."}

If most theorizing about grand conspiracies turned out to be well-supported, the term wouldn't have any negative associations. When you have enough evidence to prove that a conspiracy actually occurred (e.g. Watergate), most people celebrate your investigation into the facts. So even if the CIA popularized it, they picked a pretty neutral term. But this article doesn't really prove what it sets out to. The whole argument is just *post hoc ergo propter hoc.* It does show much greater use in the 45 years after the CIA memo, but that could just be due to a generally increase in the prominence of conspiracy theories in American life (the memo came out after the Warren Commission Report, after all) and the gradual, natural popularization of the term. Instead of comparing 45 year chunks, it would be interesting to compare the years immediately before and after the memo was released."}

Even those who claim to be feminist but don't qualify as the whack job nuts you find on twitter and tumblr are told they're not even feminist by \"feminists\" While no true scotsman is definite in high regard here, the reality is that words are defined by contemporary usage. A second factor comes into play. When you have feminists who are of a normal and standard demeanor and belief, one that is simply equality and not lunacy, rape culture, and oppression at every turn, people generally agree with them, by this agreement you find that the general population doesn't see them as requiring a second term to define them because they hold views that are, even if not pronounced, a general consensus. All cases of pejoration of group labels adheres to this, although other caveats may exists. Fundamentalism for example by definition is a strict view of literalist interpretations of the holy books, regardless of religion. Given that this is far removed from even the normal religious groups, it results in this sort of view. It is rare to find fundamentalists who do not hold views that are very much agreeable with the empirical knowledge of the world and as such the view there is likely properly applied and not a bad apple pejoration. With conspiracy theorists you see a similar case as I we did in feminism above. A \"conspiracy theorist\" who discovered Watergate would be seen not as a conspiracy theorist but as an investigative hobbyist/journalist or some other general term, because while it relates to a conspiracy properly, the finding of \"conspiracy\" in general is a quite prevalent thing, as almost every crime involving more than a single person is a conspiracy, and we do not refer to police detectives as conspiracy theorists, though regularly you they apply theories to their work in understanding and routing conspiracy in the criminal world. You have to consider the function language at the root to understand how it works, it isn't so simple as a term becomes a designation to a certain group with its meaning representing the actions of loudest and most radical members, rather you also have to consider what groups the less radical members of the similar belief system / view / whatever belongs to, typically they move away from that designation as they approach the median view point. Other terms such as communist, liberal, and what not, do not have a specific designation, rather they are over generalization pejoratives, which blanket lots are tossed under for the sole purpose of describing it as such typically for a fallacious ad hominem approach to the discourse. These terms generally are not viewed to actually represent any specific set, except when the actual usage is properly used, which is not in favor in the pejorative form."}

I'm great at thinking on my feet and talking to people, but that's not an asset until I get an interview. These are the tactics I've used to get dozens of interviews over the last 5 years in competitive fields, mostly for jobs with a listed degree requirement. *Note that these guidelines are for crafting a custom resume for a specific position. If you are trying to send the same resume to several companies or upload it into a database all of this doesn't necessarily apply. Goal: To convince a manager that you are a worthwhile interview candidate in less than 10 seconds with a Resume and Cover Letter. Of course obvious advice such as not having spelling or formatting mistakes is important, but these strategies can help you stand out of a pile of well-written resumes. 1) Cover Letter (First-person) 1a) First Sentence - The first sentence should be a snappy overview of what you do, your experience, and the assertion that you are excited about the position. E.g. \"I am a front end web developer with more than 8 years of experience and I'd love to bring my skills and enthusiasm to your growing engineering team.\" 1b) Address the cover letter to the hiring manager. This info should be easy to find online or with a phone call. 1c) Body of cover letter - Go beyond the company's website and find out what the company's long term goals and challenges are. Address how you would use your skills to help the goals be met and the challenges overcome. 1d) Tone - Match the tone to the organization. A goofy yet smart cover letter might get your foot in the door at a startup, but a formal letter would be more appropriate for a bank. Looking at how their web copy is written is a good indicator of this. 2) Resume (3rd-person) 2a) Objective - You must mention both a benefit to you and to the company as concisely as possible. Don't just say you want a position at X doing X. E.g. Objective: To obtain a position in data entry where skills in spreadsheet development and troubleshooting can improve efficiency and enhance value. 2b) Key accomplishments and attributes - Not more than 3, maybe 4 bullet points. These are your selling points, make sure they are punchy and desirable. 2c) The rest - Make sure it fits on one page and all relates to the position you are gunning for. Don't include \"will furnish references upon request\" or any other unnecessary clutter. Include multiple forms of contact information. Be specific. Don't use fluff words or phrases, especially in your objective and key accomplishments. Show, don't tell, .e.g. instead of saying \"developed outstanding customer service skills\" say \"served a high volume of customers while offering impeccable service.\""}

I wasn't doing it with malicious intent, or least not that I was aware of, but looking back, she was absolutely right. I would often mention the great lengths I'd go to see her or do something for her (like flying home for 6 hours to celebrate her birthday). In my head, I was simply showing off how much I loved her that I would do those things. I had no idea that it placed stress upon her to reciprocate/match the effort until she told me. We had a very healthy discussion about it and I put effort into changing that about myself. It took some getting used to (I had no idea how bad it was!) but now I don't even think about mentioning stuff like that to people...and I feel better about it."}

Coming from someone who believes they have the authority to direct/weigh in on this choice (your boss, controlling parents, an insecure partner, etc. ), it can be passive-aggressive. It carries an implied \"or else\". There's a world of difference between, \"That's not my cup of tea, but you do you\" and \"I wouldn't do that if I were you\", but I'd argue they're both passive aggressive. Unless they were directly asked to participate, the \"that's not my cup of tea\" comment is unnecessary and dismissive. It's just interjecting their (negative) opinion on someone else's decision, and calling it into question. It's maybe easier to explain with the original example: \"It's up to you, but I'd rather you not\". Someone's right to choose for themselves is a given in this scenario, right? If it weren't (for whatever reason), they'd say that instead. So the comment is really just \"I'd rather you not\" (aggressive) with an immediate retraction to offload responsibility for the outcome (passive). \"I'd bet it all on black, but, it's your decision\" = I'm reserving the right to say \"I told you so\" if black hits, but it's not my fault if you bet on black and lose."}

The only question I have is that *would they be able to filter the job applications through IP location?* For example, rejecting any application that is not submitted from Omaha.

For example, Twitter bots etc. to boost a hashtag, with links to pre-fab, script-generated applications and instructions for submission. Automate the whole process except the very last step.

Principles are having a set of beliefs, integrity is having those beliefs regardless of external influences or circumstances. no one is asking anyone to change their beliefs but if you act because of something, Or in spite of something, you are still are allowing it to control you. To dismiss the premise of something because of the abstract idea that someone somewhere has an agenda, is a fallacy. so dismiss all the information, either you agree with the cause or not. I have written quite significantly on the structure of game tree and decision tree in relations to social engineering, and some times what you are saying is true, but it doesn't change anything, unless you are petulant and thing acting spitefully in an attempt to preserve personal agency is a display of free will. If written a number of social engineering gambits based on the principle that people like you do exist, in its most basic premise it involved trying to get them to do the opposite of what you want and watching them do what you want out of spite. Its not clever, its not unique and its not progressive to ones own agenda. This issue at its core is a strike about workers rights and solidarity with the working class. I am a member of the working class, so this issue is my issue. anyone who thinks otherwise is either rich enough to not have to care what I think, or fooling themselves. Its fine to say you don't agree with the premise, and its fine to not agree with the premise. but acting smug about some impertinent observation like you are the smartest guy in the room just kind of highlights how little you thought through your own thoughts. I'd suggest looking into [game tree]( if you want to think about political issues in a more tactical and later strategic sense, rather then an impulsive reactionary sense. this helps prevent people being that proverbial \"one step ahead\" if you care about this I can link to some of my writings that explain this sort of thing a bit further."}

Mind you I'm not doing anything besides walking in to the other side, getting my paperwork and walking out. So I'm doing nothing nefarious. However seeing that they leave the door open left me with this idea. I can't take credit for it but I truly wanted to see if it worked so I can cut down on my time spent here. So I put on the safety vest, and grab my clipboard. At first employees just looked and moved on... every employee just ignored me... that day I had to pass back and forth 4 times... (dumb reasons but whatever) So earlier today I tried it again... again I kept getting looked at. Not one word said to me. Grabbed my paperwork and walked back. This time I had an employee talking to me. Literally asking me if I was just getting there to clock in. In truth I was honest with him and he didn't care, but at first he was thrown off thinking I was an employee. The fact that it worked that well was insane to me, how many people just don't recognize who works there and who doesn't, and doesn't think about the security. Now again I wasn't there to do any harm and I just wanted a short cut to get in and get out... but I thought I'd share the story on how effective that knowledge is... Edited: to improve quality of read."}

At work, in relationships, even with strangers which made me felt invisible. Then I discovered these psychology tricks that completely flipped how people treat me. Now people actually listen when I speak. Here's what I learned: 1. Stop over-explaining yourself. The more you justify your decisions, the weaker you sound. Say \"I can't make it Friday\" instead of \"I can't make it Friday because my cousin's dog has a vet appointment and...\" which sounds bad like you're running away from it. 2. Use the 2-second pause before responding to anything, count to two. It shows you're thoughtful, not reactive. Plus, it makes people hang on your words. Silence makes people perceive your words as credible. 3. Match their energy, then dial it down 10% If someone's excited, be interested but stay slightly calmer. If they're angry, be concerned but composed. You become the stable one they look up to. Most people are emotional so if they see you are not they will respect you. 4. Ask \"What do you think?\" instead of giving advice firs. People respect those who value their opinions even when you know the answer, let them feel heard first. 5. Stand up straight, but relax your shoulders. Confidence is shown when your taking up your space comfortably. This one changed how people see me instantly. 6. Remember small details about people like \"How did your presentation go last week?\" These little callbacks show you actually pay attention. It's rare, and people notice when you mention things that are easy to forget. 7. Say \"I don't know\" when you don't know. Pretending to have all the answers makes you look insecure. Admitting ignorance? That takes real confidence. Being honest about your knowledge makes you genuine. Respect isn't about being the loudest or smartest person in the room. It's about being genuine, thoughtful, and secure enough to let others shine too. Try just ONE of these this week. You'll be shocked at how differently people respond to you. If you liked this post perhaps I can tempt you with my [weekly newsletter]( I write actionable tips like this and you'll also get \"Delete Procrastination Cheat Sheet\" as thanks"}

Here are some ways to build it: 1. Train your mind to make quick connections. Wit often comes from linking two unrelated things in a clever way. Play word games, puns, or improv exercises that push you to think laterally. 2. Listen closely. A witty remark usually builds on what someone just said. The sharper your attention, the more opportunities you\u2019ll see to twist or reframe their words. 3. Read and absorb. Expose yourself to witty writers, comedians, and conversationalists (Oscar Wilde, Tina Fey, late-night hosts). You\u2019ll pick up rhythm, timing, and phrasing. 4. Practice timing. Wit lands best when delivered at the right moment\u2014often with brevity. Sometimes holding back until the perfect beat makes your line hit harder. 5. Play with understatement, exaggeration, or surprise. Classic witty tools: Understatement (\u201cOh, just a minor inconvenience\u2014like a meteor.\u201d) Exaggeration for comic effect. A surprising twist on expectations. 6. Keep it light and kind. Teasing can be witty, but if it crosses into mean-spirited, it stops being charming. Aim for playful cleverness, not put-downs. 7. Practice in low-stakes settings. Try witty captions on photos, clever responses to friends\u2019 texts, or banter in casual chats. Over time it becomes more natural. Via ChatGPT."}

I'm currently in training to work as a private investigator. Aside from tracking down cheating spouses and fleeing debtors, my boss told me there are a bunch of different reasons people hire PIs. Someone mentioned that they had been hired to track down someone who had abused their kids and such, and someone hit me up asking me if I could investigate whether or not their sister was being abused by her boyfriend. I thought about how that would be done, and the court cases about people who've been convicted (or not) of domestic abuse. One of the bigger means of figuring that out is by talking to the defendant's exes to see if their history of abusive behavior holds up. How would I find out that sort of thing? Unlike marriages, relationships aren't registered legally as far as I know, but that seems like a crucial bit of information."}

All you can really do is plant seeds of healthy reminders and be there for them when they've realized they've been duped. Do not say I told you so, in any form of the meaning. I recommend watching videos about people escaping the Amish, the Mormon groups and the like. It probably won't be as intensely abusive or absurd that your family member is going through, but it can help give understanding of what it's like to be brainwashed to an extent. Maybe get them to watch with you if you find one that really strikes a cord, make sure to not downtalk the people who've been brainwashed in the shows because it's not their fault they're getting taken advantage of and itll show your family member that you dint think less of them for being manipulated. If someone grabs your hand and punches you with it, it's not you doing it; the manipulators are doing that to those people's minds. Good luck all round. Do not make yourself an enemy of either of them. Let the family member know you might dislike some decisions they make if you need to and wouldn't make some of their decisions yourself but you don't judge them or think less of them because of their choices(being manipulated is not a choice, but they will feel like theyre making the decisions most likely). Don't phrase it like they're being brainwashed at first, if the manipulator gets found out they'll either flee or restrict the family member, most likely and if the member thinks you're against them being together they'll reject you and your ideologies if the manipulator knows what they're doing. I'd watch videos about cults once in awhile when you're around them, at the very least. Maybe start having regular visits with the family member, to show that you care about them and to give a safe space to just exist in case they're not getting that feeling much around anyone outside of the relationship. Good luck, legit. You'll need it. Just show them you care. They'll need it."}

Insults rather than reason. Can't let something go.) The internet is really bad for these people. The army of fake bot accounts is here for them to create a fake feeling of mass approval, trigger them, or help spread bad info.

Also, in most social situations I find it\u2019s best to lie to people in a way that\u2019s obvious it communicates you don\u2019t value their opinion or presence and they get to go talk about how you lied to them but they\u2019ll typically start avoiding you.

Going to parties gave me panic attacks. Making small talk felt like trying to speak a foreign language I'd never learned. Now I can start conversations with strangers, speak up in meetings, and actually enjoy social situations. Here's what worked for me: 1. Start stupidly small. Don't jump into deep conversations first. Start with \"thank you\" to the cashier. Nod at people walking by. Say \"good morning\" to your neighbor. Build the muscle slowly. It doesn't matter if its small talk just learn to get into the habit of talking. 2. Ask questions instead of trying to be interesting. \"How's your day going?\" \"What brings you here?\" People love talking about themselves. You don't need to be funny or clever just genuinely curious. Plus it makes conversations longer. 3. Use the 3-second rule. When you want to say something but feel scared, count to 3 and force yourself to speak. Don't give your brain time to talk you out of it. The longer you negotiate with your brain the harder it will feel like. 4. Embrace being awkward. I said weird stuff deliberately. I stumbled over words. I had uncomfortable silences. Guess what? People forgot about it in 5 minutes, but I remembered that I survived it. People move on. 5. Find your \"social training ground\". For me, it was the gym. Same people every day, low-stakes conversations. Find a place where you can practice regularly with the same group. Could also be in the library. 6. Stop apologizing for existing. \"Sorry, can I ask you something?\" became \"Can I ask you something?\" \"Sorry to bother you\" became \"Excuse me.\" Stop starting conversations like you're inconveniencing people. It's not a mistake you were born. So stop being sorry all the time. 7. Remember: Everyone's focused on themselves. That embarrassing thing you said? They're not thinking about it they're worried about what they said. Everyone's too busy being self-conscious to judge you as much as you think. That's why letting overthinking get the best of us never ends well. How it changed my mindset: * Social skills are skills. Like riding a bike or playing guitar. You suck at first, then you get better with practice. The only difference is everyone expects you to already know how to be social. * Once I stopped trying so hard to avoid awkwardness, I became less awkward. When you're not constantly monitoring yourself, you can actually be present in conversations. * If you take nothing else from this just remember you don't overcome shyness by waiting until you feel confident. You build confidence by doing scary social things while feeling scared. Start with one small interaction today. Say hi to someone. Ask how their day is. The world won't end, and you'll prove to yourself you can do it. Let me know if you've used any of the tactics above."}

People like genuine interaction that comes from the heart. Human beings are also really good at inherently sensing your vibe. It's less about reading books or top 10 charisma hacks on Youtube. Foster an earnest interest in others and provide value to them in a way unique to you. Maybe you're funny, or a good listener, or give great compliments, or you're a good conversationalist. Maybe you don't have much to say, but stoically do things to help others. If other kids aren't noticing that from you now, adults absolutely will later in life. Sometimes you just need to find the right community to value your personal strengths. Not everybody winds up in a social environment that fits them, for example adults in a toxic workplace. Keep getting out there. Join community events, group activities, hobby clubs. You'll find a good circle of people who will enjoy your presence! So if you do all of this, and it still seems like you're having problems. It's very likely you have some kind of deep internal conflict you need to tackle first. Basically, your discomfort stems from your own self-perception. That's something you can work on, if that's the case."}

Instead, I found a blueprint for genuine charisma that's been hiding in plain sight for 80+ years. Here's how to actually apply the book's lessons to become someone people genuinely want to be around: 1. Use their name + genuine interest. \"Hey Sarah, how did that presentation go?\" Not just \"Hey, how's it going?\" Their name + specific memory = instant connection. People light up when they realize you actually listen. 2. Ask about their opinions, not just their day. Instead of \"How was work?\" try \"What did you think about that new policy at work?\" You're asking for their thoughts, not just facts. Makes them feel like an expert. 3. Find something to genuinely admire. Not fake compliments. Look for something they chose or achieved. \"I love how you handled that situation\" hits different than \"Nice shirt.\" You're acknowledging their character, not just appearance. 4. Be enthusiastically wrong. When they correct you, respond with genuine interest: \"Oh really? I had no idea! Tell me more about that.\" Most people get defensive when corrected. Charismatic people get curious. But don't overdo this because it can make people dislike you. 5. Let them teach you something. \"How did you learn to do that?\" \"What's your secret?\" Everyone has expertise in something. When you position yourself as their student, they feel valuable and smart. 6. Remember the small details. \"How's your mom feeling after that surgery?\" \"Did you ever finish that book you mentioned?\" This isn't stalking but caring enough to remember what matters to them. Carnegie understood that everyone walks around with an invisible sign that says \"Make me feel important.\" Charismatic people are just really good at reading that sign. Most people are self-centered so when you listen to others with intent you become more social. The mistakes I made early on: * Trying to be the most interesting person in the room instead of the most interested * Complimenting things people couldn't control instead of choices they made * Waiting for my turn to talk instead of actually listening * Making everything about me instead of about them The less you try to impress people, the more impressive you become.

He was a very charismatic guy. I\u2019m by no means an expert, but it\u2019s surprisingly helpful in a lot of ways. One of my biggest takeaways was how Carnegie instructors teach. It\u2019s subtle and you don\u2019t realize it right away; you\u2019ll never hear one of them say \u201cno\u201d or correct you when you\u2019re wrong. They will give you some kind of encouragement like \u201calright, good. You\u2019re on the right track. What if we looked at it from this perspective?\u201d They also won\u2019t use the word \u201cbut\u201d. You\u2019re right, but\u2026 isn\u2019t in their vocabulary. I use this all the time when I meet new hires. I occupy a specialized support and pseudo leadership role that they can call on for help. I ask them if they know when they\u2019re allowed to call and get them to think a little. If they name a situation that\u2019s appropriate, I\u2019ll say something like \u201cYes! Very good. When else?\u201d I\u2019ll do that a couple of times and then tell them that all their answers were correct. I explain that I was just kind of teasing them and getting them to think, and the there\u2019s one all encompassing answer; they can call me for anything. Every now and then someone will get it right and I\u2019ll be delighted! For either case I\u2019ll list some broad reasons to call and finish up by telling them that it\u2019s ok if they want me to check if their shoes match their clothes. I won\u2019t mind, I just want them to call. It\u2019s been very effective (plus other stuff that\u2019s often Carnegie based) and my organizations numbers show that we perform better than national averages as far is it goes with the things I support."}

Carnegie's frame is centralized on the idea that People are problems to manage, not nervous systems to meet. Followed literally, his books prioritize public influence over genuine authenticity. They are literally a how to manual for people pleasing at the cost of personal boundaries. People-pleasing is \"a behavioral pattern characterized by prioritizing the needs and desires of others over one's own, often to gain approval or avoid conflict. It involves consistently striving to please others, sometimes to the point of self-sacrifice and neglecting of one's own needs.\" If influencing people comes at the cost of my own authenticity, I refuse. If friendship comes at the cost of distorting my own natural signals for the sole purpose of appeasing others in their comfortability, I am not willing. If making friends and influencing people revolves around abandoning my own self, this is not worth it. Carnegies book is a great explanation on how to influence people's perceptions. But I disagree that controlling perception equates to friendship. If that were the case, wouldn't politicians have the most amount of true friends? Don't criticize, condemn, or complain - Abuse victims get trapped while alcoholics throw things at each other or at them. They stay quiet about the abuse because to do otherwise would be too negative to be listened to & would block human connection. Give honest and sincere appreciation. - you do this but because you're autistic you say it with no eye contact with a flat affect and everyone assumes it is sarcastic so then your accurate signal gets misinterpreted. Carnegie fails to mention that only appreciation that is in the expected empathetic performative way gets valued. - The idea that appreciation is universally recognized is a false premise. Hence the double empathy problem in autism. \"Arouse in the other person an eager want.\" - translates to, withhold information - Be vague to allow other person to fill in their own projections - This is fine if their projections include connecting with you. However, what if the desired goal requires transparency and precision? - Henceforth, performance is assumed to be more valuable than accuracy. Sometimes the case, not always. - This then creates a reward pattern for human manipulation. - Avoiding clarity if it risks discomfort comes at the cost of ambiguity breaking down things systematically / projection jumps."}

(E.g \"it's creepy how interested you are in this topic) - OR taken literally romantic interest is assumed because the other person believes no one could genuinely care about them THAT much unless they were romantically interested. (Or guys being seen as creepy, girls being seen as flirting) - most people bonding over shared cues and not mirrored nervous systems and shared pattern depth - Carnegies frame fails because it assumes interest = safety but if you show genuine interest towards an abuser or manipulator, guess who gets trapped? - Obviously I'm not saying to NEVER show genuine interest but what I am telling you is that most people HAVE an unspoken limit they don't feel comfortable surpassing. Smiling all the time - tell the fucked jaw story -> nervous system boundary override. \"Remember that a person\u2019s name is, to that person, the sweetest sound in any language.\" - some people hate hearing their own name, genuinely, and this subset appears to never be taken into consideration -> especially if their name was weaponized in the past. - Perfect example? Trans people's dead names. - Using name too often sounds fake, rehearsed, manipulative, or like you're trying to sell something Be a good listener. Encourage others to talk about themselves. - taken to its logical extreme results in 'why are you interrogating me?' - Second creates unequal power dynamic teaching people that what they have to say is meaningless compared to the other person. - encourages robotic conversation -> look at AI if you want a real example here. Is manufactured care and empathy still real empathy? Is empathy nothing more than the correct series of words? Is self erasure worth a perceived influence? - Or you ask something they don't feel comfortable with disclosing and you don't know they're uncomfortable because they never say it but they assume you can see they're uncomfortable with it so they assume it's intentional & hate you. There is no universal internal map of what should be obvious. - The more you know about a person the more you see their vulnerability which scares the fuck out of most people. - If you encourage the other person to only talk about their interests and then they do the same to you how does anyone ever form a connection? People want to be heard only to the extent that it doesn\u2019t mirror their pain too clearly. \u2022 People want intimacy only when they still feel in control of their image. \u2022 And if you see too much \u2014 especially silently \u2014 they might decide you are the threat. Talk in terms of the other person\u2019s interest. - social strategy: self abandonment - Never ever talking about anything you like does not build a real connection. - How would you ever know if that person is aligned with your values if they don't know a damn thing about you? - So sure they LOVE your mask...yet no one ever knows YOU. And that YOU is worthy as fuck of being seen. Make the other person feel important \u2014 and do it sincerely. - double empathy gap strikes again - Nobody will believe you if it doesn't match their expected performance. - You can be autistically sincere and say the kindest things in the world to someone but if it doesn't match their mapping, their perception, of neurotypical performative kindness then it will not be well received. - Carnegies frame assumes that if you truly mean it, they will feel it, which is an invalid frame. The only way to get the best of an argument is to avoid it. Potential problems: 1. what if a discussion of disagreement is necessary? 2. Should disagreement of any kind be seen as rude? 3. Doesn't the bystander effect continue to perpetuate abuse? Show respect for the other person\u2019s opinions. Never say, \u2018You\u2019re wrong. - protects perception over accuracy - If people don't know if they've made a mistake, how can they possibly improve or change? - If you incorrectly assume that their mapping is the same as yours; it leads to a culture that rewards faking performance over actual results. - And again, why is disagreement seen as rude? If you are wrong, admit it quickly and emphatically. - taken to its literal extreme, you slowly degrade your own reputation and throw yourself under the bus and others believe you are incompetent. - This teaches submission, not attunement. But taken literally, it trains conscientious people to self-sabotage \u2014 - while those who mask or manipulate their image experience no reputational penalty at all. Begin in a friendly way. - ok, well my definition of friendly is someone who doesn't lie to me, who doesn't use performance to try to manipulate my beliefs and actions, and someone who genuinely is matching with what I am interested it rather than masking that. However, if I begin from this frame, others see my lack of performance as unfriendly because we have different definitions. - Neurotypical presentation of empathetic isn't the only possible definition of friendly. - Plus, the phrase \"sickeningly sweet\" and \"butter me up\" exists for a reason. If you're too nice people think that is manipulative, which also sucks. - Furthermore it encourages masking over genuine connection and genuine self expression. It convinces people that it's more important to sell yourself for others than to listen to your own nervous system. - Then You internalize that truthful presence is dangerous unless carefully dressed up. So then you learn ok, I have to script everything just to be seen as valuable or treated as a person. You question your unscripted self's right to EXIST. Get the other person saying \u2018yes, yes\u2019 immediately. - so manipulating people to say yes is what constitutes true empathy? - This trains automatic agreement. What if you actually WANT someone to think for themselves? - Language manipulation like this programs them to follow along because their neurotransmitters are pre-programmed to do so.....AND Let the other person feel that the idea is theirs. - this is textbook manipulation - If they believe the idea is theirs, then why would they ever need you? - Then people get praised for ideas they didn't come up with which then encourages them to continue performative tendencies rather than real progress - This teaches people to value feeling smart over becoming wise. Call attention to people\u2019s mistakes indirectly. - great, so if they're autistic they won't understand because you refuse to offer signal clarity out of your own fears of being judged, so they won't ever be able to change or improve because nobody can outright say to them 'do it this way instead'? - Or worse, the attention called is so indirect it is never even perceived to begin with? - Or worse, the mistakes you believe they are making are empathy gaps on your part??? End with: If someone influences your decision without your awareness, did you really choose it?\u201d"}

I almost got married in a relationship that lasted almost 5 years. It was a very beautiful relationship, but due to my immature behavior, it ended. It left me with a scar. Due to my condition, I decided to develop an alter ego or a dissociative or multiple personality disorder. I mean, I developed a personality that led me to cope with the grief I've had for almost a year. Thanks to that personality, it has kept me going to this day. With a little context, a few months ago I met a bisexual tomboy at the gym. I felt love at first sight, despite her unkempt and unkempt appearance. I mean, she didn't want to show any signs of her femininity; she didn't care much. But something about her captivated me deeply, and so I decided to get closer. I told myself I had to try because I had nothing to lose. And so, guess what? After a few conversations and making my intentions clear, she told me she thought I was cute, and we went out a few times until I tried to have something a little more private by giving her a kiss. That's when she cut herself off, confessing that she wasn't over her ex (wife) and that she was just breaking up. So, she wanted to take it slow, and even though I stayed a little lol... I told her it was okay, we kissed, and that was it hahaha. So, as the days went by, we went out, had fun, got to know each other, she told me a little about her life, and I told her about mine. She told me that no one had ever treated her like I did, and that in 4 years, no man had even noticed her. She confessed that her sex life was scarce, nothing at all. Everything was going well with her, so to speak, until I started noticing certain behaviors. She had told me she was still talking to her ex. I never judged her because I'd been there too. In fact, I don't think it had been about 7 months since I'd ended my previous relationship, and I decided to take a chance with her, not remembering my ex, of course. She started to distance herself and treat me with indifference. She wouldn't answer my messages, wouldn't go out, wouldn't do anything with me, and I couldn't explain why. That's when I realized she had avoidant attachment. I just felt like a fool for wanting to be someone important in her life and her showing me indifference, but I consider myself very patient and tolerant, or a masochist, however you want to see it. Until she reached a turning point where she told me she couldn't and didn't want to give me what I was looking for: \"to have an emotional responsibility with me.\" She was always very blunt or unaffective with me, but I never paid attention to her because I always saw her and she never got upset about how much of a pain I was. I never complained about her being blunt or demanded that she be more effective. I told her I wasn't going to take that as her final decision and that we should just continue with our lives as normal because we never committed to being anything, or being a boyfriend or anything, but I did fall in love... I was confused because I reminded her that she wanted to take it slow for a while, and it wasn't just \"go slow\" anymore, it was \"no go,\" and I honestly felt sad. It's been about three days since we last spoke. The last time I went out with her was to the pool table because I insisted again that I still saw her as my first option and wanted to continue enjoying her company. She didn't want to talk to me much, and we just played and drank. She bought me a few drinks, and that was it. I felt like they played with my feelings... Now my alter ego says she'll come back, because I have no doubt that everything I gave her isn't easy to erase, or so I want to believe, as if it were also a joke from the universe, that exes always come back, even if I want to be skeptical. But if it happens, I want to be prepared. This time, not be the one they play with, but be the one moving the pieces. I want to make her fall in love with me as she is if she comes back, but more so by manipulating her as a kind of revenge. Because I have no doubt today that what she did was because she didn't know what she wanted and she played with someone with only good intentions, but good people never win. What do you advise? I'd like to continue with my normal life, that's what I'll do. But it was truly love at first sight, and I'd like to take matters into my own hands, like designing a master plan. I'm learning NLP and psychological tricks, so I'm open to any suggestions. ////////////////////////////////// Es mi primer post, y quiero comenzar diciendo que soy hombre que tiene estos varios rasgo de conducta, apego ansioso \"parcialmente dominado\" PAS (persona altamente sensible) sobre pensador Un poco de contexto antes continuar pues quiero que sepan que hablar con dos caracteres cuando se refieren a mi. Tuve una relaci\u00f3n en donde casi me caso la cual dur\u00f3 casi 5 a\u00f1os, fue una relaci\u00f3n muy bonita pero debido a actitudes inmadura de mi persona se termino, me dejo una cicatriz debido a mi condiciones decid\u00ed generar un alterego o un trastorno de personalidad disociativa o m\u00faltiples, me doy a entender que genere una personalidad que me llevo a sobre llevar ese duelo que he tenido a lo largo de casi un a\u00f1o, gracias a esa personalidad hasta el d\u00eda de hoy me ha mantenido de pie. Ya con un poco de contexto hace unos meses conoc\u00ed a una chica tomboy bisexual en gym, sent\u00ed amor a primera vista a pesar de su aspecto poco arreglado y descuidado, vamos que no quer\u00eda dar rasgos de su feminidad no le importaba mucho. Pero algo en ella me cautivo profundamente y pues decid\u00ed acercarme yo me dec\u00eda a mi mismo que ten\u00eda que intentarlo pues nada perd\u00eda. Y pues que creen, despu\u00e9s de una platicas y dejar claras mis intenciones ella me dijo que yo le parec\u00eda guapillo y salimos una veces hasta que intento tener algo un poco m\u00e1s privado en darle un beso y ah\u00ed fue donde ella se corto confesando que no hab\u00eda superado a su ex (mujer) y que estaba reci\u00e9n terminada entonces ella quer\u00eda ir lento y pese que me qued\u00e9 un poco xd... le dije que estaba bien, nos dimos un besito y ya jajajaja. Total que va pasando los d\u00edas salimos nos divertimos, nos conocemos, me cuenta un poco de su vida yo de la m\u00eda, ella me dice que nadie la hab\u00eda tratado como yo, y que en 4 a\u00f1os ning\u00fan hombre se hab\u00eda fijado y me confeso que su vida sexual era escasa nada de nada. en ella y vamos que entre comillas iba todo bien hasta que comienzo a notar ciertas conductas. Ella me hab\u00eda comentado que segu\u00eda hablando con su ex, nunca la juzgue pues yo tambi\u00e9n pase por ah\u00ed de hecho no hab\u00eda pasado creo como 7 meses desde que termine mi antigua relaci\u00f3n y decid\u00ed aventurarme con ella no recordando a mi ex pareja claro. Se comenz\u00f3 alejar y a tratarme con indiferencia, no me respond\u00eda los mensajes, no quer\u00eda salir, no quer\u00eda hacer nada conmigo y yo no me explicaba porque y ah\u00ed me di cuenta que ella ten\u00eda apego evitativo. Yo solo me sent\u00eda un tonto por querer ser alguien importante en su vida y ella mostr\u00e1ndome indiferencia pero me considero muy paciente y tolerante o masoquista como lo quieran ver Hasta que ella lleg\u00f3 en un punto de inflexi\u00f3n en donde me dijo que no pod\u00eda y no quer\u00eda darme lo que yo busco \"tener una responsabilidad afectiva conmigo\" ella siempre fue muy seca o poco afectiva conmigo pero nunca le preste atenci\u00f3n pues yo siempre la ve\u00eda y nunca se disgustaba por lo chicle que yo era, nunca le reclame por ser seca o exigir que sea m\u00e1s afectuosa, yo le dije que no me iba a tomar esa como su \u00faltima decisi\u00f3n y que sigamos normal con nuestras vidas pues nunca nos comprometimos a ser algo ni ser novio ni nada, pero yo si me qued\u00e9 enamorado... Yo qued\u00e9 confundido pues yo le record\u00e9 que ella quer\u00eda ir lento m\u00e1s de un tiempo ya no fue vamos lento sino \"no vamos\" y yo sinceramente me sent\u00eda triste. Ya hace como 3 d\u00edas que no hablamos, la \u00faltima vez que sal\u00ed con ella fue al billar porque le hab\u00eda vuelto a insistir que yo si segu\u00eda vi\u00e9ndola a ella como primera opci\u00f3n y quer\u00eda seguir disfrutando de su compa\u00f1\u00eda, ella no quiso hablar mucho conmigo y nos limitamos solo a jugar y x pies bebimos ella me invito uno que otro tragos y ya Sent\u00ed que jugaron con mis sentimiento... Ahora mi alterego dice que ella va volver, pues no me cabe duda que todo lo que le di no es f\u00e1cil de borrar o as\u00ed quiero creer, como si tambi\u00e9n fuera una broma del universo de eso tipo de que las ex siempre vuelven aunque quisiera ser esc\u00e9ptico. Pero si pasa quiero estar preparado. Esta vez no ser con el que juegan sino ser el que mueve las piezas, quisiera enamorarla como es si vuelve, pero m\u00e1s manipul\u00e1ndola como especie de venganza pues no me cabe duda hoy que lo que hizo fue por no saber lo que quiere y jugo con alguien solo tenia buenas intenciones pero los buenos nunca ganan. Que me aconsejan, quisiera seguir con mi vida normal, es lo que har\u00e9. Pero en verdad ella fue un amor a primera vista y quisiera tomar cartas en el asunto como dise\u00f1ando un plan maestro, Estoy aprendiendo pnl y trucos psicol\u00f3gicos as\u00ed que estoy abierto a cualquier sugerencia"}

Secondly, determine what you have experienced an honest person concretely looked like, acted like. Dig back, find someone you know or met that signalled honesty and integrity. Make a note of what excactly did that, perhaps you can pick up some specific trait, on top of avoiding expressing others, as mentioned before. Finally, some behavioral mechanisms I believe works well in giving an impression of honesty and integrity. They are mentioned together here, because I really think integrity is a primary indicator of honesty. Work on what you think integrity is, because you'll need it in everything to really succeed with anything. I believe in smiling, maintaining eye contact and showing personal attention will be interpreted as an indicator of being an honest person. Work on becoming (or fake being) curious to other people, asking easy questions that makes them feel comfortable and reflecting inwards, because they will project their own self reflection onto you as honesty and intimacy. It's a fine line to keep people comfortable when using intimacy, so be careful, and don't forget to smile and make the air talk, meaning be patient in conversations. Straighten your back and walk head high. Identify clothings and apparel that pertains to prejudice against (or cliches of) people with a look like yours (whatever you really meant with your initial question) and avoid those. It goes for hair style aswell. Don't invite anyone to put you in a category. If you are really vulnerable to prejudice, from your looks and traits alone, you gotta work actively against those. I always try and find moments and comments and gestures where pauses work for me. There is some very satisfying mind control going on if you can maintain having people always listen to you, and it takes being quiet in all moments except the exact right and opportune ones."}

All I\u2019m getting is to squint more if your beautiful unwrinkly Mediterranean skin isn\u2019t showing enough genuine emotion Here's a summary of what Ekman's research suggests: * There are different types of smiles. A Duchenne smile is the genuine smile of true enjoyment, and it involves both the mouth and the muscles around the eyes. A \"fake\" smile involves only the mouth. * The \"phony\" smile can come off as dishonest because the lack of eye engagement can be subconsciously interpreted as a lack of genuine emotion. * Context also matters. Smiling in an inappropriate situation or to cover up another emotion can be perceived as an effort to manipulate the situation, which can also be seen as dishonest. From my perspective, this is where it gets interesting... \"How to Win Friends and Influence People\" by Dale Carnegie is a classic self-help book that advises people to smile a lot to be more friendly and approachable. This advice seems to directly conflict with Ekman's research. Carnegie's advice to smile more is about making a good first impression and being polite. It's about being likable, not necessarily about being perceived as honest. Ekman's research, on the other hand, is about the subtle cues that reveal genuine emotion. The two aren't necessarily at odds. Carnegie's advice can be helpful for building relationships, but Ekman's research provides a deeper understanding of human behavior. You can smile to be friendly, but if your goal is to be seen as honest and trustworthy, you'll need to make sure your emotions are genuine. \u2026 so good luck to us all!"}

Whilst it's true that he did focus on teaching people how to detect deception and micro expressions are mostly unconscious, that doesn't mean people cant learn to control them, not necessarily through sheer force of will but through controlling the emotions that are tied to them. Since micro expressions themselves are purely involuntary you can't control them directly, but you can control them indirectly, and in my personal opinion, this topic isn't really about controlling your facial expressions its more about controlling your emotions, which as I understand it, is one of the key aspects of social interaction in general. Nobody likes talking to someone that is noticeably upset, and that really is the main point isn't it? When someone walks around not overly happy but with a joyfull content, most people (of course not everyone) enjoy interacting with them, but this directly ties into someone's micro expressions and how they present themselves to the world. If anything I would suggest to OP that paul ekman is good to know but not necessarily what he is looking for, if i may make a suggestion it would be the book \"presence\" by Amy Cuddy. There are other books to read, but I really enjoyed this book and am probably over due for a re-read. Sorry if this is an overly long response. This was more meant to be a middle ground between the two arguments, and I studied social interaction for a good number of years so sometimes when I get on a train of thought, I have a hard time putting on the breaks. But I hope this was helpful nonetheless. Edit: oh just in my personal opinion, learning fire safety might actually make you a better arsonist, given that it is general fire knowledge and if you learn safety measures you can learn how to counter them \u00af\\ _ (\u30c4) _ /\u00af"}

This book was a wake-up call. 1. Stop seeking approval from everyone. I was exhausting myself trying to make everyone happy. Realized that needing constant validation was actually selfish I was more concerned with how people saw me than actually helping them. 2. It's okay to have needs and express them. Spent years pretending I didn't need anything from anyone. Turns out, having needs is human and expressing them clearly actually makes relationships better. 3. Stop doing covert contracts. I'd do nice things expecting something in return but never communicating that expectation. Then I'd get mad when people didn't read my mind. Super toxic pattern. 4. Set boundaries without apologizing. \"No\" is a complete sentence. I don't need to justify every boundary with a 10-minute explanation about why I can't do something. 5. Take care of yourself first. Not in a selfish way, but you can't give what you don't have. Started prioritizing my own physical and mental health instead of always putting others first. 6. Stop avoiding conflict. Conflict isn't inherently bad as it's often necessary for healthy relationships. Learning to disagree respectfully instead of just going along with everything. 7. Be direct and honest. Instead of hinting or being passive-aggressive, just say what you mean. People respect directness way more than I thought they would. The book can be a bit intense and some parts didn't apply to me, but the core message about authentic relationships vs. people-pleasing really hit home. Anyone else struggle with the \"nice guy\" attitude? I realized I had this for 6 years until I read this book If you liked this post perhaps I can tempt you with my [weekly newsletter]( I write actionable tips like this and you'll also get \"Delete Procrastination Cheat Sheet\" as thanks"}
