Instead, all I did was apologize and ask if we could reschedule. That's it, one sentence, no additional information, no explanation or excuse as to why I missed the first interview. They replied within 20 minutes, apologizing to ME, saying it was probably their fault, that they'd been having trouble with their computer system for days, and of course I could reschedule, was I available that afternoon? Don't ever volunteer information, kids. You never know what information the other party has, and you can always give information if asked for it later.

Every time she tells it, most of the time in front of me, I just want to crawl under the table and hide. However, that would give her another humiliating story to tell. Just because you're a parent doesn't mean you have a right to humiliate them for a laugh. I do think that telling about something cute they once did (pronouncing something wrong, for example) is different to an embarrassing story, but if your child doesn't like you telling about it then you should still find something else to talk about. Edit: I mean telling stories from any part of your child's life at any part of your child's life. When I say child, I don't mean only someone under 18, I mean the person that is your child. Edit again: This post blew up, can't believe how big it has gotten. Getting a lot of comments from the children (including adult children) involved but also parents which is awesome. Im also getting a lot of comments about how this is a self-selecting sample and in the wider world, not as many people would support this. All I have to say is that just because there is another 50,000 people out there (or whatever number) who wouldn't care about this doesn't mean that the 50,000 here matter any less. It's not about proportion, its about that number existing in the first place. How do you know if the person you are talking about isn't one of those 50,000 people? There is a much, much more constructive way to teach your child to be less sensitive. I laugh with my kid, not at him. We do it when we're on our own or in safe groups. If he tells me something funny he did, I laugh with him and I'll tell him stupid things I do so we can laugh together. I don't humiliate him with personal and embarrassing stories around Christmas dinner or whatever. It's about building people up, not breaking them down. Embarrassing someone to give them thicker skin is a massive gamble between ended up with someone being able to laugh at themself and someone who is insecure, or at worst fuels the fire of an anxiety disorder. I'm not gambling with my kid."}

The algorithms are keeping you angry, turning you into a zealot, and you aren't actually informed!", "content": "We all get baited into clicking on content that makes us angry, or fuels \"our side\" of a contentious topic. The problem is that once you start engaging with \"rage bait\" content (politics, culture war, news, etc) the social media algorithms, which aren't that bright yet, assume this is ALL you want to see. You feeds begin filling up with content that contributes to a few things. First your anger obviously. But secondly you begin to get a sense that the issues/viewpoints you are seeing are MUCH more prevalent and you are more \"correct\" than they/you actually are. You start to fall into the trap of \"echo chambers\", where you become insulated from opposing views, which makes you less informed and less able to intelligently develop your opinions. For example: If you engage with content showing that your political side is correct to the point of all other points being wrong (or worse, evil), that is what the algorithms will drop into your home screens and suggestions. This causes the following * You begin to believe your opinions represent the majority * You begin to see those who disagree with you as, at best stupid and uniformed, at worst inhuman monsters * You begin to lose empathy for anyone who holds an opposing view * You miss out on the opposing side, which may provide valuable context and information to truly understanding the issue (you get dumber) Make a conscious decision to engage with the internet positively. Your feeds will begin believing this is what you want. You will be happier, your feeds will be uplifting instead of angering, and you will incentivize the algorithms to make you happy instead of rage farming you. The people fighting back and forth online over the issues of the day are a small minority of people that represent nobody, nor are they representative of even their side. Oh, and no, I'm not on your political \"side\" attacking the uninformed stance and tactics of the other. I am talking to you!"}

That kind of worries me. But I feel like a lot of the changes annoy me or just don’t work as well, for me. Like a lot of the Microsoft keyboard shortcuts that made me very efficient just don’t seem to work as well as they did. The web based outlook email search results don’t just simply show everything in reverse chronological order. It tried to guess what’s most relevant. I don’t see a way to turn that off. And the TAB autocomplete is a POS. (The Linux TAB autocomplete for directories and commands is great but that’s nothing new.) Outlook tries to make the email chain look neat instead of just letting me simply scroll down the email and see the whole chain as it was in raw format. It tries showing the clean name of the person when I want to see the email, always. I don’t like how it groups an email thread. I’ve played around with the options but it just doesn’t go back to “classic”. Trello is cool but I just don’t feel the need. I already need Excel so prefer to track things in Excel. But I see how it is a cool concept. But it’s one more thing to open and one more place to update things. Notes is very cool but I’m so used to keeping my notes in a Word document. Word and excel is always open. The less programs I have to open the better. And it’s not just software… I don’t like how my car dimmens the mirror making it harder to see if the car behind me at night is a cop car. I hate forms that try to be smart about phone number or social security formats that don’t let you copy/paste that information or make you retype everything if you got one digit wrong. And my iPhone auto-playing iTunes music when I plug it into my car. It’s annoying that you can’t turn that off! I don’t want iTunes. I get my music from YouTube playlists. Also don’t like e-brakes that don’t let me control the hand brake. And that auto high beam/low-beam is not reliable (so I turned it off) and the 3 blinker is also annoying as I actually use turning signals properly (way ahead of a turn and before hitting brakes - turned that off as well). I do love the Teslas though. I rented one for three days and I got it fully integrated with my phone and downloaded the charging app and figured out every feature in that thing. So I guess there is hope for me."}

Husband and I would do this to get more bees. Freebees we call them. In our city, and in many in US, you can call 311. 311 will have a list of beekeepers in the area you can call. So, bee light goes off in the sky, we jump in the bee mobile, and make a beeline to rescue those bees. Wow!!! Thanks all for the upvotes an the award!!! That was my first ever!!! Gold!! Thank you kind Redditer!!! I really should tell you all my swarm in the car story!! Swarm in the car. I am on mobile so please be kind. So, it was over 10 years ago and we got a call from the fire department. If you had a swarm you called 911 and police or fire called the beekeeper. Husband had the bee vacuum on another call so I took the swarm box (plastic file box with an empty honey frame in it) and went in my minivan to the far North of my city. We live in the far south. It was late afternoon and when I got to the business all of the workers were inside looking out the window. They had locked the door....likes bees would know!! The swarm was about 4 ft off the ground and around a tree. Very easy. Put on my bee jacket with helmet and veil, my bee gloves and took my swarm box and bee brush. Very easy to brush the bees into the box. Put the box on the ground and spray liberally with prepared sugar water (like nectar) and wait for bees flying around to go to the box. If you have the queen, the bees will follow her. Easiest capture I had ever done.....or so I thought!!! I put the uncovered box in the back of my minivan. You keep it uncovered so they don’t suffocate. Took my gloves off and placed them next to the box. Took my jacket off and put it on the passenger seat. Waved to the business people and drove away. Got on the freeway right at rush hour... within 20 minutes the bees had licked all of the sugar water off each other. All of a sudden I heard what sounded like an airplane taking off. I look in the rear view mirror and see all of the bees flying straight for the front of the car. All of the windows except windshield were tinted so the bees were going towards sunlight and out!!! All over windshield!!! Flying all around me, 10,000 (approx) bees!!! I turned on the defroster to get them off the windshield and they started clumping up on the window. Many bees fell on to my jeans and then crawled up my jeans. Now remember, I don’t have my jacket with helmet and veil on. So, I get downtown and traffic is stopped!! I am able to gently get bees off my face and get my jacket with helmet and veil. I keep driving. I get to my exit. You can see the bees flying all over inside, clumps of bees on windows DOT is closing my exit.......WHAT!! I start honking. Guy putting out pylons has his back to me and is waving me off. I keep honking. He turns around with a surly look on his face.....then he sees them!!! He says O My God!!! Could read his lips, didn’t have to hear him!!! He lets me go!!! Thanks!!! I get home and husband is home by this time, sees my plight and laughs!!! I climbed out the back and we were able to vacuum up the bees in the car and hive them!!! Not the end of the story....I was at a conference a few years later (not a bee conference) and the head of the department of transportation for my state was there and talking about the funniest things that happened on the major Interstate. 1. Vodka tanker spilled into the river. 2. Some crazy lady was driving around with bees in her car.....I raised my hand...that was me!!! Crazy bee lady!!"}

By all means, extend an invite to others, but if nobody makes plans, just go do it yourself. Instead of asking “hey, we should go out and do ______ some time”, say “hey, I’m going to go _________, did you want to come?” This way you already have plans to do whatever it is you’re doing, and you’re just extending an invite. Not actually basing whether you will do thing on someone else. Hope this helps someone! Edit: A lot of comments are pointing this out.

From elementary school through medical school, libraries have helped me each step of the way. They’ve had dramatic changes over the years. In high school, only the nerdy kids would go to the library (on top of the senior citizens and young families). A decade later, I can see that the the library has become a place to hang out. It’s become a sort of after school day care for high school kids. Many middle/high school kids have LAN parties. Smaller kids meet up together with their parents to read (and sometimes cry). My library has transformed from a quiet work space to more of a community center over the past decade. Even though I prefer pin-drop silence, I have no issues with these changes. **It’s better that kids have a positive experience in an academically oriented community environment than be out on the streets, getting into trouble, etc. And putting younger children around books is always a great thing.** Plus, they have a quiet study room for pin-drop silence people like me!"}

A guy starts talking, asks me where I am. \"Uhh, at a bench near the river? Honestly no clue dude I'm not from around here.\" He keeps talking, saying random things at times, clearly stoned. He keeps asking me to stay where I am and not to go anywhere. I start getting the feeling I'm going to be mugged, I'm looking around and noticing I'm not in the nicest part of Savannah. Its a cricket phone, too. A god damn cricket phone. I tell the guy \"uhh can we just meet at like a convenience store or something?\" And he says no, keeps telling me to stay right where I am. So I stay, but rip a branch off if a nearby spanish moss tree for self defense purposes. Half an hour later, this guy leaps out of the bushes, comes running at me and shouts \"GOD BLESS YOU SIR\", quickly takes the phone out of my hands and then runs off.

She was a sweet old woman who loved to chat with people but never came to a single activity. She politely declined but started to cry a little. When I asked her if she's alright she told me how happy she was that I bothered to come by each day just to ask if she wanted to join even though she never does. She explained to me how important and welcomed it made her feel and how, even though she doesn't come to activities, she still felt like a member of the community and made the place feel more like home. I was holding back tears. To me, it felt like I was just a nuisance bugging her each day to do something she didn't want to do. I had no clue how important it was to her that I come just to invite her. After that I tried to invite as many people as possible to everything. Please keep inviting those people who normally decline. You might not know how incredibly important it is for these people to just know that they are welcomed. Even the tiniest gesture can mean the world to some people. EDIT: since this blew up I wanted to add, please (COVID allowing) volunteer at your local retirement/nursing/rehab facility.

I guess I can shut down some of the disagreement by saying that every field does things a little bit differently, but this is what’s worked for me as a soon-to-be college grad, with little truly significant work experience, and wanting to go into education. Most American employers/career help centers I’ve met with suggest keeping it to about a page because employers won’t go over every resume with a fine-toothed comb right away. Anything you find interesting but maybe less important could be brought up in an interview as an aside, perhaps. A few people have mentioned LaTeX. I use LaTeX often in my math coursework, but I’m not comfortable enough with it outside of mathematical usage for a resume. Pages (on Mac) has been sufficient for me. As far as LinkedIn go, it’s a less-detailed version of the master document I keep, as far as work experience goes, but I go way more in depth into relevant coursework and proficiencies on LinkedIn than I do on paper. TL;DR- I’ve never had two people or websites give the same advice about resumes. Everyone’s going to want it different. *Generally* in the US, the physical resume could afford to be shorter because it leaves room for conversation if called for an interview."}

Not nearly all of it is always necessary nor will a good chunk of it ever actually be seen by an employer, but it can help jog a number of memories as well as help you think of better spins on negative experiences.

Looks bloody awful over in America, those wildfires are right nasty. Lucky, us Aussies have been surviving through all that and much worse for at least a couple centuries, and I'm here to give you guys the inside info on how to survive. 1 - If you live on an upslope, ridge, or narrow forested road, get the fuck out early - no help will come. People here who stayed then changed their minds later, and couldn't escape because trees fell within minutes and blocked exit routes. Firefighters were either unable to get in, or were forbidden due to extreme risk of being cut off themselves - 1200 litres of water in a Cat7 is like pissing into a hurricane, especially if you're up on a ridge. 2 - if actually caught and unable to escape. dig in and cover with DRY WOOLEN BLANKETS! Please fill your bathtub before it hits - water tanks will melt real fast and you'll have no water - the thing that MIGHT make the difference between life and death could be as simple as layers of wool blankets, a low sheltered concrete corner, some sheets of tin, some DRY wool blankets, and one moist towel to protect from radiant heat. Wet clothing or sheets are inferior to a wool blanket and you will boil alive. Do not cover any yourself in anything wet! 3 - If defending your house - wool or cotton long sleeves and leather boots, and wear LEATHER GLOVES if possible. You can throw burning stuff back but without gloves, no way. 4 - Remember that the only safe area to run to is often INTO an area already burnt - you can also survive by having a shallow grave and laying in that under dry blankets, a layer of wet stuff and tin, and breathe through a wet cloth to avoid suffocation. You'll collapse real fucking fast without oxygen and remember also, many houses are made with plastics and toxic gas-causing materials so.... yeah.... stay safe out there and honestly, if you live on a ridge or uphill slope... run now. Your life is worth more than stuff. 5 - If you think you can defend, don't forget to protect your water tank and exposed poly lines - if that goes, you're fucked. People on gravity feed systems, this is your weak point. We were lucky enough to have a small Honda pump and Cat7, but our tank was on fire several times - if that had gone, we'd be gone. Remember this, especially if on a bush block with some tank uphill off in the scrub. If you're not gonna be able to save that tank, forget about it. You're going to lose your house, get out now. 6 - Remember, fire can move up to 400km (250miles) per hour uphill. If you change your mind and live on a ridge, you are quite likely fucked. Don't die for stuff. Escape, and we can hunt down the corrupt fucks who made this happen later. Channel that anger to the ones who sold us out and gave away our water and our future to line their own pockets. Stay safe America! : EDIT : I had no idea this'd blow up so much, and it's great to see so many people invested in keeping fire safe, you're all fuckin legends and thanks to everyone who's put forward awards. I'm not sure what they do, but I appreciate y'all care so much. : POINTS WORTH CLARIFYING : A Cat7 is a type of firefighting engine available in Australia. Not sure what your American equivalent would be. NEVER use water to cover your blankets or yourself, EVER. Use it as an external barrier to embers on the outermost towels. Actually I'm a chick ✌️ Large bodies of water are good to venture out into if necessary, but keep in mind you need a decent level of physical fitness to maintain treading water whilst also inhaling smoke at the same time. NEVER use synthetics or anything with a synthetic blend. Wool is best on a budget, duvetyne is probably the best material available, 100% cotton towels will also work in a pinch. Never synthetic . : EDIT 2 : Wow this really blew up. I'm fucking honoured, and I'm glad to see so many people out there really giving a shit about fire safety. All your suggestions, feedback, and positive discussion really reignite (haha) my faith in humanity. We can all get through this if we work together I'm working my way through all your comments (and there really are a lot of them), and trying to answer as many questions as I can."}

If you are sheltering in your house, your instinct may be to stay in an interior room like a bathroom. DON'T. Always make sure you have at least one exit directly to the outside of your house. Stuff windows and doors with wool blankets to keep smoke out, but don't trap yourself. But yeah. The biggest LPT is, get out early if you're going. Fire moves fast, you can't outrun it."}
