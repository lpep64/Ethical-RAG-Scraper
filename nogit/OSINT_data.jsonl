I tested 12 photos from a total of 3 countries around the world. I used screenshots for each. It is surprisingly accurate! I tried some easy photos that had landmarks, and some more obscure ones like the view from in a car out the window showing the side of a random highway in France. Nothing particularly identifying in the photo like text that gives an approximate location. In this example, it gave a near accurate location, approximately 9 miles off but it knew it was on a highway around there. For the other 11 photos, only two had issues while the others were all generally correct. The coordinates were always off but it gave the correct city. The only ones it did not work for was one that guessed two states away in the US (though it successfully identified the same location with another photo from a slightly different angle. The other it just gave a server error for each time. The photos included rooftop views, major metro cities, a rural tourist city, car views, day and night photos, and even a view from a bridge that was correctly identified to the exact bridge. I\u2019m definitely going to save this tool! Excited to see what else you develop and how this tool progresses. My only suggestions are that I have the same copy issue another user shared. Also, maybe consider adding a way for users to tell the AI if it guessed correctly or not? I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s feasible or worth it but I felt the desire to help correct the AI when it guessed wrong and to help it narrow down the coordinates. Lastly, consider adding more useful info about the locations instead of vegetation and soil? Things like population, popular cell carriers/ISP\u2019s, news significance regarding current events, etc."}

I found some interestingness! Firstly, for real photos, it seems to do a pretty good job. I'm actually pretty impressed. Nicely done! The real surprises for me though came when I put some... \"non-standard\" imagery into it. For example, the other day I put through two pictures of a place in **Cairns, Australia** - one a photo from Google Street View (edited to remove text and other chrome), and one of the 3D photogrammetry from Google Earth of the same area (similarly edited). * The photo was identified as being in **Brisbane, Australia**. The country is right at least, but the place was not - Brisbane is quite a long way away from Cairns! * However, the 3D photogrammetry was somehow identified correctly as being in **Cairns, Australia**. I have no idea how it did this. I was expecting some nonsense, but no, it actually did it. I also tried putting two screenshots from places in **FFXIV** through it. It somehow identified that they were both images from FFXIV (which frankly is more than I was expecting given that this is intended for real-life photos)! * The first picture I gave it was from **The Goblet** (the housing district of Ul'dah, in the desert), it thought it was from **Ishgard** (which is situated in a snowy area). * The second picture I gave it was from **Kugane**, and it got that correct! Honestly, the fact that it even identified these images as being from FFXIV is pretty great, to me. I also sent an image (that I created myself, not a photo) that was literally just white text on a black background, which read \"**This is a photo of a rolling landscape with palm trees. The mountains in the background are reminiscent of the Grand Canyon.**\" I guess the AI can read, because it did in fact identify the text as a photo taken from **the Grand Canyon National Park in Arizona**. It didn't pick up on the inconsistency of the rolling landscape or the palm trees, but I can understand that. There was another image I sent through it, but it was kind of a joke. I sent a (rotated 90 degrees) photo showing nothing but a GPS receiver showing exact coordinates of a location in **Scotland**, with no other context clues. It misidentified the photo as being taken on a street in **Portland, Oregon**, and said \"This is evident from the street signs and the buildings in the background.\" (There were no street signs or buildings in the image.) As I said, that one was kind of a joke and I didn't expect it to work, but it's still amusing how I have an image which most humans could rattle off the GPS coordinates for very easily (even if they don't know where that actually is), but that this AI can't!"}

In case anyone is interested in hardware stuff, I copied the response below: Between the DB/Web and data aggregation server, there's a copy of the data at any given time, loosely speaking, and not a full backup. So that's 1 copy. RAID 10 mirrors the data, in addition to striping, so that's another copy, again loosely speaking. If one of the drives fail the RAID can rebuild. There search server is not backed up, strictly. The data on that server is derrived from the main servers. That said, it does have RAID 10, so one of the drives can fail same as above. However, the entire search index is less size than the server's memory, so the filesystem requests will be mostly handled from memory, making it a small amount less something to be concerned about. Elasticsearch has data redundancy built in in it's architecture, but I've decided against multiple nodes in general, unless something significant changes. Aside from those built in redundancies, I occasionally make offsite bakups manually."}

While working on this, the thing that kept coming to mind is how much I had to learn SEO, business intelligence, and marketing analysis tools in order to track influence op intentions and intended audience, scale, primary channels, and gauge harm empirically from vectors of discovery. To answer your questions: 1. I would love a disinfo/influence ops tool that combines cyber attribution tools (common IP addresses, security certificates, open ports, proxy use, virustotal API integration..etc.) with marketing intelligence tools (common reshare channels, backlink sources, social media shares with associated hashtags, top audience countries...etc.) and analytics (maybe AI enabled) across both to detect inauthentic website creation, posting behavior, shifts in reach..etc. I know I can use Maltego for this, but I don't want to spend $1k+ for the pro version AND all the expensive API integrations. 2. I think sleuthing with attribution and specifically exposing advertising and financial incentives (and the providers of those, Google, etc.) goes a long way to stopping troll storms at the root. Having worked at Meta, I can say that bad PR, especially on hot-button new tech like AI, goes a long way to getting them to do something. We just found out [claytoncountyregister.com]( has been suspended and Google's removed it from its search results after this Wired article. Happy to chat more over DM if you'd like."}

Come up with a persona for the sockpuppet account. 2. Use [Fake Name Generator]( to create a person whom you feel fits your sockpuppet persona. 3. Use [This Person Does Not Exist]( to generate an image. Make sure you inspect the image closely and get one that doesn't have any obvious flaws, as they often do. It is worth picking up some Photoshop, GIMP, Affinity Photo or Designer, or other basic image manipulation skills to fix them and change the background of the image. 4. Get a burner phone, completely wiped and fresh. Can be any brand that will accept a Mint Mobile SIM card. 5. Get a burner credit card from [Privacy.com]( to use for on Amazon and possible the Mint Mobile setup. They might need it to set up the account. 6. Set up a burner Amazon account. We're only going to use it once. 7. Buy two Mint Mobile SIM cards. You can find them various places online and in stores near you, but you can get two of them for $5 on Amazon. They also give you 1 week free trial with something like 100 text messages, which we're going to use. This gives you two cards for two sockpuppet accounts for only $5. 8. I like to use Amazon to have the card sent to an Amazon pickup box, which can be anonymous. 9. Get a VPN that you can set to the physical area in which you want your sockpuppet to \"exist.\" 10. Set up the Mint Mobile trial account somewhere away from your home; as far as you're willing to go. 11. Use this Mint Mobile trial phone number to set up all of the websites you need. 12. I recommend at least set up a Google account and Protonmail account. Both will come in handy at different times. 13. Once you've set up all the accounts with your trial Mint SIM, set up 2FA on all of the accounts. 14. After setting up 2FA on all of the accounts, change the phone number to one you have more permanent access to, such as MySudo or Google Voice. 15. Make sure everything works! 16. Destroy the SIM card. 17. Wipe the phone. A lot of these websites are blocking MySudo, Google Voice, and other VoIP numbers. That's why we go through the Mint phone number first. They should be less stringent now. As always, feedback is welcome! This was originally posted on my blog where I also talk about the [ethics of sockpuppet accounts]("}

That said, there are other services out there like Privacy.com that are more anonymous. /r/privacy can probably help you out with that. Another alternative is to go out of town, use cash to buy a prepaid Visa from a small gas station store, and wait a month or more before you use it. As point number 10 says, go as far away from home as you\u2019re willing to go to keep it disconnected from somewhere that the \u201creal\u201d you would be using. You\u2019ll want to do this not just to use WiFi but because of the phone tower connections from signing up with Mint Mobile. It\u2019s been a while since the last time I set one up, but I don\u2019t recall requiring an app. I\u2019ve used small $15 flip phones for this. Pop the SIM in, call the number on the package. If it does require an app and you can\u2019t find a phone number to call to get around this, I would then probably go with an Android phone and check if Fdroid App Store has it. I would check for you right now myself but I don\u2019t currently have any of my Android devices with me. I want to point out two things: 1. This is /r/osint. My guide is for OSINT sock puppets. My guide goes above and beyond the required level of privacy, even with the aforementioned small personal connections, for OSINT. If you\u2019re looking to make OSINT sock puppets that require more security and privacy most likely means you plan to do more than OSINT with them. That is not what my guide is for. 2. Because of that, my sock puppet guide does not guarantee full anonymity, especially in regards to state powers. The government has some really wild tools and resources and I\u2019m pretty confident if they want to find one of us, they will. There\u2019s not much to do about that. Despite how your local DMV may be run, when it comes to finding a person of interest, they\u2019re pretty good. Edit: added words to a sentence for better clarity."}

A cybersecurity firm called Chainalysis traced donations from a single Bitcoin wallet to various far-right groups. The donor used a program called Namecoin years ago to associate his online handle with that Bitcoin wallet, so he didn't make it too difficult really. I searched for the handle (Pankkake) on Google with different keywords (Bitcoin, Namecoin, different fascist terms, etc.). I think it was Namecoin that ended up giving me a hit, I can't remember now and Google has adapted since to everyone searching about him. So I found a site called [btcbase.org]( that archived Freenode IRC chatrooms from years back. Between 2012 - 2014, Pankkake was active in a Bitcoin chatroom on the IRC. I found enough comments about racism, Namecoin, and Bitcoin to be confident it was likely the same person. I read through the chat archives for four or five hours, searching for different terms (specifically, I searched on Google for things like \"Pankkakke nazi site:btcbase.org\" or \"Pankkake BTC site:BTCbase.org\"). I found that he used to know the main developer for the privacy cryptocurrency Monero among other crypto figures, one of whom posted a racist blog in the chat. I followed the link to read the blog and found that Pankkake had made an account on this site as well. I clicked his profile, it linked to his personal site called Headfucking (really weird link tree site with a mix of fetish porn, a fan site for a goregrind metal band, and his personal blog). His personal blog was under his real name, and his final post was a suicide note. The suicide note confirmed that he had donated to the far right, and using his real name I was able to work backward and build a better profile on him for the article, find French forum threads with old college classmates of his discussing his political leanings, etc. A helpful Redditor told me that I could have skipped a lot of that by searching in the nameid.org index for his Namecoin handle! That had personal info leading to his blog, so that's good to know for future reference. Obviously, Chainalysis did the real work here by diving into the list of transactions and tracing them in the first place, and I just followed in their footsteps to publish this guy's actual name and backstory. I'm looking at online courses and tutorials to explore using blockchain explorers as a future investigative tool myself. Anyway, *verrry* basic OSINT on my end that amounts to just lots of Googling really, but it was interesting to trace his activity through the years and find his personal blog. Thanks!"}

Just because specific materials reflect light differently in certain spectral bands, doesn't mean we can pick up on it if the sensor isn't good enough. So on agriculture we often talk about NDVI which shows the relation between near infra red and red bands (pictures of those bands). It highlights healthy plants due to chlorophyll content of plants and how the various wavelengths of the em spectrum interacts with it. (PAR region) Now toss in a couple of dead bodies. I have no idea what bands would specifically pick that up, especially if clothed. But the main point im trying to make is that the spatial resolution is not high enough to pick up signal. A field of wheat sure, a tiny human body from space. Less so. Say Sentinel 2 with a spatial resolution or GSD if you will, is 10 meters. That means a pixel in the picture is 10 by 10 meters. So let's go to paid for imagery. Here we can get 1 meters or even down to .3 meters these days. Now you can say that a car may be 1 or 5 pixels. Its still very little data to pick up a signal on. For this kind of data you really need aerial surveillance. Drones or planes. I can imagine that's pretty illegal though."}

After careful discussion among the moderators and some active members, we\u2019ve decided to implement new guidelines to maintain the quality and integrity of submissions while supporting the development of useful tools. Effective immediately, any new app or tool posted must adhere to the following transparency criteria: 1. **Completely Free**: While we appreciate paid OSINT tools, they are not to be promoted in this subreddit by the owner. 2. **Open Source Requirement**: All code must be hosted on GitHub, or public repository and linked in your post. 3. **No Vibe Coding**: While innovative, the security and protective measures for both developers and users are not yet adequate. 4. **No Breached Data**: We\u2019re all aware of the sources for such data; this is not the place for it. 5. **Clear API Usage**: If your app utilizes APIs, list them clearly. Explain how your app uses these APIs differently from existing services to avoid redundancy. (For those that vibe code and will post anyways, don't leave your API keys out in the open.) 6. **Human-Centric Posts**: Steer clear of AI-generated content. Present your tool in a human voice, explaining why it\u2019s superior to others or how it can aid an OSINT investigation. 7. **Demonstration Encouraged**: Consider showing a demo of your tool on YouTube (ensure no personally identifiable information is shown). 8. **No 'What Should I Make' Posts**: If you\u2019re passionate about OSINT, take the initiative to identify what the community needs. A good start is searching the subreddit for tools that are no longer functional or problematic."}

I get the feeling that this subreddit does not agree with this statement, but I believe you folks live in a bubble. Have you ever stopped to consider that widely accepted and applauded pillars of the OSINT world like the ICIJ promote and make available breached and leaked data in an easy-to-use form? The source of the Panama Papers that changed the entire world by exposing corruption is a breach of a massive law firm. Have you ever considered that some of the best OSINT platforms in the world make breach data available and, in fact, have some of the best breach data databases in the world integrated into their offerings because of its sheer OSINT power? Examples: Babel Street, Maltego, etc I can understand it from the point of view that it could get the subreddit banned, but that really should be the only reason you need to give. Breach data is OSINT, it is highly valuable, and it is considered ethical by a large portion, if not a majority, of the proffesional OSINT community that actually regularly uses these tools and techniques for business, research, journalism, etc."}

I'll just leave one lingering suggestion: I think owners of paid tools should be allowed to post about their tool on the condition that the post includes comprehensive details about how their data is sourced and how the backend functions, or in other words, if they essentially offer a guide on how their tool can be reconstructed. Their tool should do something novel or that generally hasn't seen much public discussion (no rehashing of tools that come a dime-a-dozen like leak data searches or just simply calling the standard APIs). Any data sources or methodologies mentioned therein must be non-proprietary and generally openly accessible. Owner's should be limited to one post where they mention their product and they must be completely transparent on pricing when they do so. I feel this way a little promotion can be allowed while still being constructive towards open-source efforts and promoting meaningful discussion for the sub."}

When I was doing that research, I noticed in earlier convos about it, one mod usually chimed in to voice their dislike of the tool as trash or junk or something negative. But lots of people clearly used it and liked it based on so many prior convos about it. So at some point the mod decided to filter out the comments mentioning a tool that they did not personally like, it would seem. It would be really great to have some transparency on which tools have been banned for discussion. A running list of them. Either that, or an auto mod notification when your comment was filtered out due to the mention of a banned tool. I assume that the latter isn\u2019t enabled due to the discussions around this topic that would result. It doesn\u2019t seem to be in the spirit of open source intel to handle it this way.

This is much more of a manual process, but have you ever tried Magic Wormhole? I use it to sync files across devices all the time. The basic idea is, it's similar in its purpose to file transfer protocols like sftp or scp, except it's peer-to-peer so there's no user account or server/client to do transfers. On the machine you want to send a file from, you \"wormhole send <some file>\" and it spits out a one time password. On the machine where you want to receive the file, you type \"wormhole receive <the password>\" and the file transfer starts. If the two machines are on the same network, the wormhole client is able to negotiate the file transfer directly on the local network. If the two machines are on different networks, the wormhole client uses a relay server to negotiate the initial network connection between the two clients, and then the clients complete the file transfer peer-to-peer over the Internet. If the public relay server is a sticking point, the source code for the relay server is available on github and you can set one up yourself, configuring your clients to use that relay instead of the publicly available ones. Definitely not a turnkey solution for automatic syncing of files, but with a little elbow grease and scripting you can streamline the process a bit. You can make it as secure as you want it to be with a private relay server."}

The person said they couldn't take the chance I might be a stalker. So, as it turned out, while following the suggested prep to document prior to using Maltego I came across some letters I had located in a storage bin at my mother's and I didn't recognize one of the names. So, I entered her first name and the new surname on Facebook and up popped her photo. After 28 years I found her living in Kyoto."}

I can't say I have too many OSINT skills since I mostly focus on fact checking for my studies/projects and geolocalisation for my hobby (urban exploration). If anyone wants some fun challenges for geoloc feel free to try and find out where the urbex photo are posted from. Why is this more interesting than most other challenges: 1. You can't easily solve this by using reverse search. Ignoring the mainstream locations, most locations posted are not known publically so you won't find them that easy. 2. There are some unwritten (or even written in some cases) in the urbex community. One of them is to not share the location with strangers to protect them. Sadly, it's something needed since urbex became mainstream and teens are chasing their 5 minutes of fame on social media. Dozens of locations were burnt down in my city and at least some of them were burnt down by wannabe teen \"urbexers\". This means in most cases the location of the photo is not mentioned online so you can't find the answer easily if you can't do it. Most people will give hints like the city or the country and you can use that to filter or to confirm the result. I don't do this profesionally, but this is the best exercise I've found for my geolocalisation skills. Just remember to keep the location you find secret, I trust everyone who does this will keep it ethical (not to mention that those who don't mind breaking some unwritten rules will have other things to do that contributing to the destruction of random abandoned places)."}

Ideally, I would like a position in a Gulf country but am open to moving to other locations. Has anyone here moved from the UK or know professionals who have moved from the UK? I would be very keen to hear their stories for a better insight."}

I just want to emphasize that with your background in intel and having some OSINT capabilities, there are jobs in several fields waiting for you. To get a first impression of possible fields of action, I'd like to point you to an article I wrote: You can find numerous examples of different jobs, where having OSINT skills is an asset. I does not solely need to be intel jobs. Personally I would advice to look at corporate investigation jobs (e.g. compliance or fraud investigations). You can find those jobs in a lot of huge companies. Another field is of course cyber security (think of threat intelligence). I like www.osint-jobs.com as a job search engine for people witg OSINT skills. Additionally, look for jobs with 'investigation', 'fraud', 'security analyst' etc. Hope that helps! Good luck :)"}

If the user has it all locked down then you may only be able to see a very limited amount of info, e.g. the screen name. I say this up front as the next step is a lot of effort. The below assumes you\u2019re not going up against a capable adversary, just a normal person. First set up a new email account (gmail, outlook etc). Get a new cellphone and a new SIM card and use the number to verify the email account. Do some normal seeming stuff with the email - sign up to some mailing lists, shopping websites, forums etc. Do this over a few days. Keep logging into the email each day and doing normal stuff with it. After a couple of weeks download Facebook onto the phone. Make a profile picture using a generative AI tool. Adjust the photo manually using photoshop etc so that it isn\u2019t recognisable as AI. Take a screenshot of it. Rename the screenshot something that a camera would call it eg IMG_12345.jpg. Save the picture to the new phone. Go to the Facebook app. Use the new email address to create a new account , and the new cellphone number for verification. Obviously use a made up name (unless you don\u2019t mind the other person figuring out who you are) and a location other than your own. Go to FB marketplace and look at ads that are local to that location. Comment or like posts on local FB pages, and enquire about a few items on marketplace. Keep doing this for a few days, regularly interacting with content from that area, and try to join some local groups. If you find a friendly sounding person or two in the area who has lots of FB friends then have a go at adding them as a friend. Once you have a few friends, you are ready to have a go at looking at the profile for the original user ID. If this all sounds like a lot of effort then you just figured out why most people are bad at OSINT. You could pay a professional to do this for you though."}

In the circles where I specifically gained my working knowledge, the sub-groups were most frequently identified by a criminal enterprise or element. I do not know if I am permitted explicit examples, but I have seen a moderator discourage \"gatekeeping\" and promote open source knowledge. Thus, to answer the OP's question: yes, there exists plenty of databases, at least two which are kept and updated by three letter organizations in the country I primarily gained my working knowledge of Ink & What It Signifies operate, and at least one I know of presided over by Interpol. Tattoos within these databases serve two purposes: most of what a specific tattoo \"means\" or \"signifies\" is an identity marker; one more convincing in authority than handwriting analysis and with more utility (outside a courtroom) than DNA or fingerprinting. This is not the esprit du Coeur of your question. You're asking about the symbolism its self, or so I do infer. The symbolism of tattoos in my experience indicated a few factors: 1) Tattoos can mean affiliation with a subgroup: I.E the horns above left and right eyebrow (Indicator: Salvatrucha/MS13/\"Treces\"), the 5 pointed star/Star of David \"Mongrel-ised\" (Gangster Disciple/ GD/ \"Folk\"), the C.W.B. which is made using the Cincinnati Reds Logo (MLB sportsteams), the B from the Cincinnati Bengals Logo(NFL sportsteam) , and the W comprised of two Ak47s (Cincinnati White Boys/ CDubs/ \"Homies\"). These examples are written in a sequential order on purpose. The reason behind this purpose is 2) Tattoos can mean Geographical affinities or affiliation: the first example is an International Affiliation; various differences in the tattoos while conforming to an overarching structure can and often do reveal pertinent information about relative geographical origins. The second example operates on a national level. The GDs originated in south eastern Chicago, but have expanded prolificly and done so without accompanying proficiency of infrastructure. This has led to disenfranchisement within the brand or label \"GD\". Patterns of discernible but subtle difference in tattoos meanings (the 5 pointed star being filled all black indicates a nouvelle vague member, Definitely not a Chicago native). The third group is the smallest microcosm of operation, locals if you will. Yet, the FBI named the C.W.B.s the fastest growing criminal enterprise of I believe 2014 in all of the US of A. 3) Tattoos can mean status/rank/\"rangas\" within a sungroup: Everyone has a similar or equivalent rank. A newbie, a hangaround, a \"peque\" - usually has none. The tattoos absence can Therefore have meaning, in certain. Contextual iterations. Where as a skeleton key might indicate (and does for many Aryn Brotherhood organizations: The 88s, White Gorillas to name two) at one point the individual held significant power in the structure of command: not quite a C Level executive, but certainly a Senior Director equivalent. Interstingly enough only the Jefes within MOST Latin American sub ggroups are noted by individual or totally unique tattoos: fitting for their primacy and outlier status in the hierarchy. 4) Tattoos can mean certain accomplishments or biographical notations: these abound: three dots on your left hand between index and thumb or over right breast plate \"Mi Vida Loca\", My Crazy Life, or in ebonics, About That Life. This indicates a perceived commitment to the Life of hustling narcotics, toting firearms, dog-eat-dog Hamurabi/\"G-Code\" subscribers. It is often the first tattoo and as a precursor to gang initiation is able to mean a predisposition or prediliction to eventual initiation into a subgroup. The ever famous and mostly wrong tear drop below the eyeline indicating murder committed, filled in dark to signify a rival or police officer as victim, or even varied under eyes to indicate if you were the victimized (murderer) or the victimized (lost a loved one to murder). The clock with no hands, the hourglass broken and spilling sand: prison time. The M.O.B. - Juvenile/psychological finger printer, as well as a professed commitment to Money over Bitches (and so what this \"means\" to certain Individuals is the individual bearer of this tattoo likely has a person in their past who was once intimately involved and is now likely fallen out with a vengeance: a rather lucrative meaning for such an individual in such a tradecraft. Organizations across the western civilization employ STG officers or Securty Threat Groups Officers. These are usually doughboys without badge or with ancillary debutation (Corrections Officers I.E. never taken the oath of public service and have limited jurisprudence authority from articles of law.) They share their knowledge in tight secret circles and constantly check applicable populations for new or evolving trends. In the USA if an STG officer sees a questionable tattoo, say one which says \"1%\" on your body, without any recourse for appeal you can be labeled an STG and assigned a risk number. This is for life, and puts you in Armed and Dangerous/Approach With Caution in every western and western affiliated database. Meaning if you try to get on a plane, the FBI is alerted. If you then land in the Schenectady Zone in EU, Interpolation is waiting, seen or unseen. Tattoos are the instruments of old and outdated tactics within subgroups of any distinction: they are too easily identifiable. Many substantive subgroups have long continued the policy of peons or low ranking foot soldiers bearing these flagrant essentially targets in permanent skin art, while the truly influential keep themselves far from such incontrovertible distinguishments. Intelligence operatives might call this a False Flag, counter intelligence move being undertaken by subgroups aware of such databases existing as those you have asked about, OP. I realize you may have been indicating a database which is synonymous with the Symbolism behind tattoos, such as the Maoui Warriers tribal bands indicating Warrior status, the Playboy Bunny with an area code indicating a profession as escort or something along those lines. Ive never heard of such a database: but again, yes the databases of tattoos do exist, but for reasons of agency specifically listed here. And no, you cannot access them. Even individuals who have high ranking offficialdom, special agents, detectives, etcetera cannot do ao without geoprinting themselves as having done so: and they better have a very specific and convincing reason for having search such and such a tattoo and its meaning within the aforementioned databases. In fact, even one who helped create these same databais through, let's say, nearly two decades of due diligence and neck breaking shit yourself risks, is not given any exception nor any implicit access to such databases."}

The idea is simple: 1. I download a Sentinel-2 image. 2. I extract the exact timestamp of image acquisition (in UTC). 3. I check ADS-B data around that time to find flights in the vicinity. 4. I try to match visible aircraft in the satellite image with their ADS-B positions. However, I'm running into a major issue: the aircraft I can *visually* identify in the satellite imagery don\u2019t match the ADS-B data neither in position nor in heading. Here\u2019s an example: * **Satellite image timestamp:** 2025-07-24 at 11:21 UTC * **Flightradar24 link:** [Flightradar24 \u2013 2025-07-24 11:21 UTC, around 49.33\u00b0N, -2.34\u00b0E]( * **Location:** Offshore near the Channel Islands * **Result:** I see one plane in the satellite image, but it is far from the ADS-B position of any aircraft at that time, and its heading/direction doesn\u2019t match either. Has anyone here successfully matched Sentinel-2 or similar imagery with ADS-B? Is there something I might be missing? Could it be related to timestamp granularity, parallax, or a delay in ADS-B reporting? Any tips or insights would be greatly appreciated!"}

Most likely the culprit is the satellite time is not of when it flew over Target but when it took the photo. Sentinel-2 imagery timestamps refer to the start of acquisition, not necessarily the exact time the satellite imaged a specific location. For MSI, each scene is collected in a swath that can take several seconds to over a minute to scan from one side to the other. If you're near the beginning or end of the swath, the actual image capture time may differ by up to 30-60 seconds. Use the Sentinel Tile Geometry or MTD_TL. xml metadata to estimate line timing based on image row or pixel position. Second, Sentinel has a spatial resolution of 10 m/ pixel in visible bands. Aircraft flying at 30k+ ft will appear displaced due to parallax relative to the ground reference. Just correct for parallax using known aircraft altitude. The third reason is Sentinel geolocation is typically accurate to about 12 meters, but ADS-B accuracy can vary depending on the receiver network and signal noise. If the area you're observing is offshore or rural, terrestrial ADS-B receiver coverage might be sparse, introducing position lags or inaccuracies. There are some other minor issues but the three above are probably what you're running into from my own experience. If you need more help on the math don't hesitate to ask."}

The CEO of palantir is a right wing weirdo who thinks protestors should be sent to North Korea, Peter Thiel can't answer the question \"should the human race survive\" wothout hesitating and going on a tangent that includes anything but the word yes, the trump admin has already allowed the richest man in the world free access to highly sensitive information on millions of Americans, and current administration members openly suggest monitoring all enemies of the regime. That last bit would take a lot of tech and funding which palantir already has being used in plenty of areas throughout the government. Still there's the underlying fact, throughout all of this, that these guys all *love* curtis yarvin. A guy who wants society replaced with \"neocameralism\" aka a state ran by corporate elites with completely unchecked power who enslave the bottom classes. Literal rokos basilisk type shit and it's not exaggeration or fear mongering to say that. Yarvin has made plenty of writings on the matter and JD Vance loves him and openly cites him as an inspiration, Alex karp is a follower of his ideology, his rhetoric has already seeped into the trump admin several times (RAGE as an example), Peter Thiel and Musk both love the dude, and numerous other massive tech ceos are converts. But Palantir said they wouldn't and they technically haven't done it yet so it's fine and you're fear mongering if you talk about it like this. Yeah I don't buy that at all lol. Building a master database is an integral part of their ideology. Its necessary. These bits from the snopes article don't exactly inspire confidence. \"However, the existence of a direct contract does not change the facts of WIRED's reporting about *DOGE employees using Palantir's technology to centralize and connect government data sources*\" \"Palantir software certainly isn't used throughout the federal government, as noted in the company's response to the New York Times story. However, *Foundry is reportedly used in the department that maintains databases on health, and if DOGE's work at the IRS is fully implemented, it could also be used to connect tax data and immigration data*\" \"Whether or not Social Security data has been moved to Foundry is unknown\" \"A June story from the New York Times clarified that the Centers for Disease Control, the National Institutes of Health and the Food and Drug Administration, all within HHS, use Palantir Foundry for data management\""}

Like the handshake theory thing, For example: Person A and Person B **don't know each other personally** and aren't directly connected but **there might be a mutual link(s):** a shared friend (Person C), or less direct **overlaps** like A attending a book club that B's spouse also attends, or both A and B going to the same church, gym, or professional association without knowing each other. Let\u2019s assume we have enough available data on both A and B (e.g., social media, affiliations, interests). \\- What methods or tools would you recommend to uncover potential network links between two such individuals? \\- I know Maltego is good for network mapping. Would it work in a case like this? \\- I\u2019m also considering listing all clubs, groups, or locations A is connected to, and checking whether B appears in any of the same spaces. Any ideas how to do this effectively? Any other approaches or frameworks you'd suggest? I know this is a bit of a departure from the traditional OSINT network investigation tasks, so any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance! #"}

Boston Marathon Bombing \u2013 Reddit Sleuthing (2013) * Online users tried to identify suspects from blurry photos. * Wrongly accused Sunil Tripathi, a missing college student, who faced mass harassment before the FBI revealed the real attackers. * Showed how quickly misinformation spreads on social media. # 3. Las Vegas Shooting \u2013 False Suspects (2017) * In the aftermath, 4chan, Twitter, and Facebook users spread names of innocent people as the shooter. * Real suspect Stephen Paddock was identified later, but reputations of wrongly accused people were damaged. # 4.

Gabby Petito Case \u2013 TikTok & YouTube Sleuthing (2021) * Internet \u201cdetectives\u201d wrongly accused neighbors, bystanders, and even friends. * Innocent people were harassed while police continued their investigation into Brian Laundrie. # 6. Sandy Hook Shooting \u2013 \u201cCrisis Actor\u201d Claims (2012 onward) * Conspiracy theorists accused grieving parents of being government actors. * Families faced years of harassment, stalking, and lawsuits. * A notorious case of how misinformation can target victims themselves. # 7. UK Riots \u2013 Twitter & Facebook Misidentifications (2011) * Citizens attempted to identify looters from CCTV images. * Several innocent people were wrongly accused and faced threats. * Police had to publicly correct the misinformation. # 8. MH370 Disappearance \u2013 Amateur Satellite Analysis (2014) * Thousands of online sleuths used Tomnod and other platforms to hunt for wreckage in satellite photos. * Flood of false sightings and conspiracy theories overwhelmed investigators and misled the public. # 9. Oklahoma City Bombing \u2013 Wrong Suspects (1995) * Before Timothy McVeigh was identified, media speculation and tips from the public fueled false suspect reports. * Innocent men were briefly targeted by law enforcement and the press."}

The next day, she changed her descriptions. The day after changed again. No physical evidence. He watched the interviews with her and the police. He said she didn't look like she was trying to lie. She was just incredibly confused and traumatized. Because of police and prosecutor mishaps, he stayed in jail for 5 days before we could see a judge and get bail. His arrest was published in the paper. He lost his job. His arrest is on his record. His cats died in his apartment while he was gone because he didn't have anybody to call. He paid a criminal defense attorney. Got the record expunged but couldn't get it sealed. He's been jobless for two years now because the arrest keeps coming up on his background check. The lawyers were all very clear. It sucks but here's absolutely no recourse. And this was without the Internet going out for his blood. A rape survivor? That pointed him out? Can you imagine? We just have to stop this blood thirst we have in this world. We are not always right. And after the mob with the torches is done, no cares about who's left there sitting alone and injured."}

Doxxing is when you publish private, identifying info about someone without their consent. That includes things like a real name, home address, phone number, workplace, financial info, or family details. A photo that OP already posted publicly on Reddit is not doxxing, especially when there is no personal info in it. The other key part is intent. DoXxing is about trying to harass, intimidate, or cause harm. What shared were two public photos from OP's own Reddit post. I did not reveal their identity, and have no intent to harass them or get anyone else to. My intent was to explain how a small investigation works, not to target anyone. If I wanted to dox I would post all his info, publicly share the true and false information about him and rile up people to take action. This isn't about Reddit rules. If I sought revenge by online mobs 4chan and other locations are where I would post."}

To analyze all this data without spending days, I integrated OSINTGraph with an AI agent. The AI handles data retrieval, analyzes your dataset, and lets you do anything you need with the data \u2014 whether it\u2019s for research, finding useful insights, summarizing an account, or any other kind of analysis. Whether it\u2019s your first time using OSINTGraph or you\u2019re back for the upgrade, it saves you from hours of tedious manual work.

You can simply see a spectral signature that\u2019s not likely to be from water alone. Landsat is comparable, at 15 or 30 m resolution depending on how you count. Those are the free ones at reasonable resolution. However, both are land-oriented and don\u2019t generally collect imagery of water more than about 100 km from land. So depending on your region, they might not see enough to be useful. There are other satellites that keep collecting over water, but they\u2019re generally about 250 m resolution at best, which can help with things like oil spills but really can\u2019t pick up plastic debris in the vast majority of scenarios.

Everything and anything I can think of that might help someone else gets written up and published.

This garnered a lot of interesting reach outs from some 1st and 2nd degree contacts. Eventually, I had three competing offers that converged within a week or two of each other - all from people a degree or two separated from me and because someone at their org noticed my work. It took about 3-4 months from the first few publications to job offer. You're probably more experienced than you realize. If you've spent any time investigating a suspicious email/domain/IP in your roles, you do have a start. It is just a matter of framing your experience and demonstrating how it relates.

How much and of what kind (i.e phone numbers, email addresses, business names, events, etc.)? When you get a solid look at your case through the lens of the data, are there any obvious holes? Double check that you have tried pivoting off of every possible data point you have. Make sure you use consistent formatting of things like phone numbers. Does the data make sense with your understanding of the facts? Try plotting events and metadata on a timeline, or on a spreadsheet of entities and related data. When you look at your case like this it will obviously have a gaping hole in it - your missing puzzle piece. You have to work around that for now while you try to understand why it's there. 2 You haven't found something, which means you thought it existed before you went looking for it. Why? Did you make an assumption that might be wrong? Were you ordered to find it? Or was it directly indicated by another piece of your puzzle? Does the thing you are looking for have to exist? Go back through emails, notes, whatever you can. Why did you start looking for this thing in the first place? 3. In a similar vein: who would know about this thing? OSINT is not the only tool in your toolbox. Pivot from your OSINT to some friendly HUMINT! Figure out who would know about the thing you're looking for, get in contact, and ask for help figuring out if what you're looking for can even be found. It's possible that what you're looking for just isn't available publicly, and a subject matter expert should be able to tell you that (perhaps even leading you to the pay-walled database where the trail runs cold). 4. Is the fact that you cannot find this data somehow meaningful to your case? 5. WHERE and WHEN does the trail go cold? What is the date of the most recent PRIMARY source on this thing? Even if you can't score, get as close as you can to meeting the information requirement. You might find that you don't need that missing puzzle piece so much after all.

I have a first person I am trying to identify that was one of a group of people arrested at an event. To me it makes sense to start with him, since he is the only individual that has a picture showing the arrest. The news article mentioned that 11 were arrested in total. This happened in New York, so I can get deidentified arrest data from NYPD covering that timeframe,, but I do not have the specific location of the arrest, nor do I know what specifically they were charged with. Because I dont have names, i can't find anything tied to court cases. I reversed the image from the news site, but only got a few results from P.E. showing him at other events, nothing helpful. I am struggling to cross the divide from this hit back to a name, social media site, or anything else tied to the arrests. Nothing is coming up through any of the normal sites with any of the pictures . In the pictures, he does not appear next to the same person in any of the shots, and only 2, possibly a 3rd, appear to be from the same day. I dont have any other information on the other individuals arrested, other than the number. The NYPD public arrest data does not show a group of 11 individuals booked at the same time or location for the correct date (plus or minus 2 days). The group does have a Facebook and Instagram page, but he does not appear in any of their photos, and I did not find any mention of arrests. I didnt find any results tied to the hash tags on X. What other options would you suggest for finding out about people tangentially connected to a larger group, or to better run down data on tying news reports of 11 people at an event from (or loosely) this group being arrested to the actual court cases and charges. So the ask is - is there an open-source way to try to tie the news event to actual court cases to see what the charges wound up being? Or is it better to keep going down the rabbit hole of trying to find someone in the 25k+ followers on Instagram and FB that mentions being arrested? Or am I overlooking something else entirely?"}

Or the arrests are there but only some were charged and you are expecting a block of eleven rather than a lower number. Something that sometimes works for me is to work backwards. So rather than following a lead like normal, I ask myself where I might find the info I'm after and then go there, see what there is and work back from that to see if anything there connects to my starting point. In this case it might mean taking the court or police records you do have, and investigating all of them to see if any connect back to the org you are interested in. While this can be a lot of work, you also build experience that will serve you far beyond this one investigation, so it's not wasted effort even if you don't win this round"}

There are a few more or less shady alternatives out there, perhaps someone else might be in a position to say more. What\u2019s positive about IntelligenceX in my book is that their CEO isn\u2019t hiding behind shady organizational structures and has actually done an [interesting podcast]("}

Promise I'm not a sales man, in fact I am a competitor in some ways, but their offering is just really good for what you are looking for. I also get their newsletter and they are constantly ingesting new breaches. So speed to ingest from leak day is pretty good. They had NPD within a week or so."}
