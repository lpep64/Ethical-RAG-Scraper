It’s usually better to be nice than right. 2. Nothing worthwhile comes easy. 3. Work on a passion project, even just 30 minutes a day. It compounds. 4. Become a lifelong learner (best tip). 5. Working from 7am to 7pm isn’t productivity. It’s guilt. 6. To be really successful become useful. 7. Like houses in need of repair, problems usually don’t fix themselves. 8. Envy is like drinking poison expecting the other person to die. 9. Don’t hold onto your “great idea” until it’s too late. 10. People aren’t thinking about you as much as you think. 11. Being grateful is a cheat sheet for happiness. (Especially today.) 12. Write your life plan with a pencil that has an eraser. 13. Choose your own path or someone will choose it for you. 14. Never say, I’ll never… 15. Not all advice is created equal. 16. Be the first one to smile. 17. The expense of something special is forgotten quickly. The experience lasts a lifetime. Do it. 18. Don’t say something to yourself that you wouldn’t say to someone else. 19. It’s not how much money you make. It’s how much you take home. 20. Feeling good is better than that “third” slice of pizza. 21. Who you become is more important than what you accomplish. 22. Nobody gets to their death bed and says, I’m sorry for trying so many things. 23. There are always going to be obstacles in your life. Especially if you go after big things. 24. The emptiest head rattles the loudest. 25. If you don’t let some things go, they eat you alive. 26. Try to spend 12 minutes a day in quiet reflection, meditation, or prayer. 27. Try new things. If it doesn’t work out, stop. At least you tried. 28. NEVER criticize, blame, or complain. 29. You can’t control everything. Focus on what you can control. 30. If you think you have it tough, look around. 31. It's only over when you say it is. 32. One hand washes the other and together they get clean. Help someone else. If you're lucky enough to get up to my age, the view becomes more clear. It may seem like nothing good is happening to you, or just the opposite. Both will probably change over time. I'm still working (fractionally), and posting here, because business and people are my mojo. I hope you find yours. Onward! Louie Please add something you know to be true. We learn together."}

It takes a bit more effort to hold a pumpkin upside down and cut it. Cutting the top you can just set it down on its bottom and go. I’m not saying it isn’t easy to cut the bottom. Put it between your legs and it is. But at first glance if you just set the pumpkin on a solid surface to cut it, cutting the bottom is less obvious. And most people would probably default to setting the pumpkin on a table and not their lap for safety."}

It’s a joke, since there aren’t many doing it, and if they are it is usually some vague ”range”of prices or only available if you ask. I would guess this hospital hadn’t published their prices and were going off some wonky range of prices they cooked up. When this person asked for an itemized bill, the hospital probably figured they would look bad so they reduced the bill. Before (and still to some degree), you would see outrageous prices for a simple visit. Sutures that would cost less than a dollar to manufacture snd package would be billed for $800, or a little two pack of ibuprofen would be $500. It’s criminal what these places get away with, and the insurance companies are no better. It’s us who get the raw end of the deal. I get it these healthcare facilities need to keep the lights on, but you would be disgusted knowing what goes on behind the scenes. Investment companies purchasing hospitals or healthcare networks in hopes of squeezing that money tree is just one example. When they realize they have no clue what is required to operate these places and aren’t making millions in the process, they end up selling it off to some other investment group or just closing down. Then once again, the community and patients suffer. Sorry for the rant, but it’s all relevant to the topic. If you want more info on pricing transparency, go to the link below from CMS. Side note: the news about Medicare finally able to negotiate the cost of medication is another janky rabbit hole to go down. You’ll gear all about these “poor” pharma companies unable to afford future R&D. But once again, these same medications are sold outside of the United States at a fraction of the cost. Enjoy! Edit: There are obviously other factors that go into the pricing, but the situation in the OP was between the patient and the facility for what sounded like an unplanned visit. The hospitals do base pricing on insurance payouts. They’ll ask $800 for a suture, but then insurance only pays $50. Obviously, the patient won’t be on the hook for the difference in most cases, as these are negotiated prices between the insurance companies and health systems/facilities. On unnecessary surgeries/procedures, look at back surgery for example. These hospitals love their ortho and neurosurgeons, because they keep the lights on. These are moneymakers for surgeons and facilities, so there’s a good chance some knife-happy surgeons will push you to surgery rather than PT or something else. Obviously, they still have to justify the surgery for more reasons than I care to list (ethical, insurance coverage/approval, etc.). At the end of the day, the true evils are insurance companies and greedy investors only concerned about pulling a profit and see you as $$$ coming in the door. Insurance is insurance, be it home, auto, or health. They don’t make money by paying out. It is a damn shame that someone’s health can hinge on bullshit between insurance coverage and payouts. I can’t speak for the rest of the world, but the US is weird. We have some of the best physicians, facilities, and medtech in the world. Unfortunately, it is cost prohibitive. We are reactive in our healthcare, even if we know there is a problem. Most people won’t seek treatment until their arm is falling off, since that visit might mean you won’t be paying rent or putting food on the table. Politics aside, it is MUCH more expensive to everyone when people go in with these compounded issues. Certain people think universal healthcare means everyone is getting full coverage and never paying a cent, but allowing everyone the RIGHT to an annual physical, dental, and eye exam would be a huge part in preventing major issues (I wonder why it’s called preventive care?!). Another example would be health education, whether it’s healthy eating or basic hygiene. It’s a fucking shame that people who are at risk to preventable issues, like Type II Diabetes, obesity, or certain cardiac issues, would benefit from the care stated above. Eating organic and clean is prohibitive in many places due to lack of awareness and the cost of eating clean is difficult in many cases. I’m done ranting, but yeah…we need to stop going at each other’s necks and see who the real problem(s) are. Double edit!: Look at those stupid brochures at your doctor’s office or other facility for Care Credit or other healthcare financing companies. They might be a great solution to a problem that should exist but, come on! Also, the fact you pay your deductible (which could be thousands of dollars) on top the money taken out of your paycheck to buy into your plan, then your copay (which might be next nothing)… only to fight to get your healthcare covered is bullshit! Oh and I almost forgot…you pay separately for your “healthcare” and eye/dental (some plans aren’t combined!) is double bullshit!"}

This is not a reliable indicator of temperature abuse. I suppose if you were purchasing a mass produced product (b&j and others) and detected voids that would be an indicator of a problem. Most Ill effects of temperature abuse can’t be detected by feeling a package. In order for temperature abuse to cause structural collapse resulting in voids it would have to set out for hours. Seemingly minor fluctuations in temperature can create a significant textural defect that is not detectable by feeling the packaging. Smaller producers products are more prone to have voids and under fills as a result of their less precise means of production. Smaller producers often fill pints directly of the pipe by hand or fill with a large spoon or with less precise machines than the big boys. The presence of voids doesn’t necessarily mean temperature abuse."}

I would suggest a few modifications to the technique shown on the video: 1. Place the ring in the least constrictive area of the finger. 2. Get the hand elevated above the heart. (Easiest to do if ring-wearer is lying down.) 3. Massage finger toward hand to reduce swelling. 4. Apply liquid soap, water-based lubricant or petroleum jelly to finger and try to work some under the ring. 5. You can use a cotton cord as shown, or even better, a flat cotton shoestring. 6. The secret for getting off extremely tight rings is to make the wraps partially overlap each other or at least touch. 7. Keep wrapping tightly until at least 1/4\" past the knuckle joint. (The person is not going to like this, so it depends how much discomfort they will tolerate to get the ring off intact.) 8. As you unwind the string/lace, it helps if you can use short fingernails to pull outward between turns. You can't win them all, but I had a pretty good success rate even when the patient was 90 years old, had rheumatoid arthritis and hadn't removed the ring since she had gotten married.

Not to mention we literally stumbled onto a few people before we saw them. Human eyes are trained to catch movement. So staying still and hiding in brush and waiting is a much better bet. Even if the person chasing has a flashlight, in the dark flashlights tend to cast long shadows and can make it even more difficult to find someone. Edit: just to clarify. I’m more talking about being chased by an average person in the event that you’re running for your life. Someone who doesn’t have access to a helicopter or NV.

So if you require translation service in your application, you can setup a Google Sheet with 1 cell for input and 1 for output (with =GOOGLETRANSLATE function), then have your code update the input cell with what you need translated and return the output cell. I used this method for creating my own OCR translator."}
