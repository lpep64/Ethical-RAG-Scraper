Brief summary of what happened: Neighborhood kid left his phone in my grass while I was mowing and I mowed it by mistake. The mother got upset and demanded I pay for it. Well she(mother) and son showed up at my door around noon and apologized. She said that she misunderstood what happened and thought that I\u2019d done it on purpose to teach her son a lesson about leaving his stuff in my yard. I guess he explained to her it was his fault which I thought was commendable for someone his age. She told me that she just stressed about it because she is a single mother and doesn\u2019t really have the means to replace it at the moment and that if it was anything else she probably wouldn\u2019t have gotten so upset but he likes hanging out with other kids and that\u2019s how she keeps track of him. I told her about my spare phone (iPhone 7 his was a 6s). I also took the advice of some of the commenters that it might be damaging to just give it to him and that I should perhaps have him work for it. I have a detached garage and have been needing to clean it and told her if he wanted to help me I\u2019d give him the phone. He instantly looked excited, I imagine he felt like he\u2019d never get a new phone, and she acted very grateful and said he could help. Left and came back an hour later, just the son this time and we got started cleaning. Took about 4 hours, a lot of work but nothing too hard (he's just 12) I had a couple cords of firewood I wanted moved out and stacked into a rack and then a bunch of boxes I cut up and had him bag and carry to the curb, he swept, had a coke and a couple slices of pizza then got his phone. I had a talk with him about paying attention to his where his things are because it won\u2019t always work out like this. I also told him if he wants to mow my yard every weekend and his mom says he can I\u2019ll pay him $30 a week. (It will probably take him a couple hours) He again acted excited at the thought of making money and when I asked him what he\u2019d spend it on he said games. We figured out new games would be about $60 and worked it out that I\u2019d pay him $20 for 3 weeks then $65 on the fourth week so he could cover tax because it might be hard for him to save. The fourth week he will do an extra little chore to cover the five bucks, like sweep off the porch or walkway. I hope I\u2019ve done the right thing and didn\u2019t make him think that everything just works out but I did my best to have him earn it. And hopefully showed an equal measure of kindness that he will carry with him. I also didn\u2019t want the mother to stress over replacing the phone as my mom was also a single mother and I know how tough it can be. My own son is just 2 so it was my first real opportunity to pass on some fatherly wisdom, which I hope is what I did. Thanks for your input everyone. I really appreciate it."}

[Here]( is my previous question. I went through every single comment from the 200+ ones and I sincerely thank each and every one of you. I did some research specifically for repairing the screen for the macbook and for her particular model it\u2019s around 310 for the screen + the labor cost so I wrote her back saying that since she didn't accept my initial offer of $2200, I\u2019m withdrawing that offer, and offering to pay for the repair cost. She sent me an email calling me a bitch and that she\u2019s going to take me to court. I got served a few days later and went to court. I told the judge I gave her three options to choose from. 1) either to write her a check for a brand new one which was 2200 dollars. 2) Get her a refurbished one from apple or a third party or even used which would be around 1400 dollars or 3) fix her current MacBook since the screen is the only thing affected here and it would cost around 300 dollars plus money for labor. (I printed out the email I sent her and the mail she sent back refusing demanding the 2700 and calling me a bitch and saying we\u2019ll go to court + screenshots for the price quotes from different websites for a new/refurbished and the screen fix for her particular model) and gave it to the judge. I also told him that when I offered at the very beginning to get her a new one from the apple store she said no I want the money in cash. When I told her I\u2019d give her 2200 for a new one she said okay but later came asking for 2700 because she wants to upgrade. I tried to show him how it's clearly visible that she's trying to take advantage of me. She gave the judge an attitude almost the whole time which really pissed the judge off and helped my case I guess. After listening to both of us he ruled that I pay 50% of the repair cost since she negligently left her laptop on the couch. So I'll only be paying not more than 200-250 dollars for the whole thing. If it weren\u2019t for you guys I would\u2019ve paid $2,200 dollars instead of around $200 and I honestly loved her look at the end as we walked out. I feel good for following all the advice here."}

Officer shows up, I invite him in and explain the whole situation. He isn't really sure what to do about it right now so he asked for a supervisor come to his position. Supervisor shows up and I go over the whole thing again, we go upstairs to my computer where I have all the videos clipped and saved (9 times of her entering the backyard and 4 of her entering the house through the garage). We watched each one and he gets on his cellphone and goes back to his car. A few minutes later he comes back with 3 flash drives and asks me to copy the videos over to the drive and had me fill out a piece of paper stating what I put on the drive and then signed it, I repeated it all 3 times. About 45 minutes later after we have been talking and he's been on and off his cellphone the entire time, 2 CPS workers show up and review the videos again and take a complete statement from me going back to the first time it happened. This took about two hours because they wanted it to be precise and as accurate as I remember it and left out anything I wasn't 100% sure on. The officers and CPS workers head next door to talk to the parents, parents apparently shut the door in their faces and said they didn't want to talk but because of my statement and the videos of her climbing over, getting stuck, having to be carried back over the times I'm at work or gone and just entering the house they had probable cause to enter the home anyways. After they were inside their house for about 10-15 minutes another cop car shows up followed by another a few minutes later. I'm in my garage so I don't know exactly what happened inside but after more officers showed up the father was put in the back of a car and the daughter was put into the CPS workers van and they left. The father was driven away about 10 minutes after that, then about an hour later the mother is also put into the back of a car and they drive away. I talked to the initial officer that showed up and asked for a supervisor and he tells me they found drugs (pills not in prescription bottles/not their prescriptions) and that the home was just not being taken care of inside and definitely not a safe environment for a child. Said they found drugs not secured and in areas the child had access to them. I haven't seen them since the day after the post, I feel bad for the kid being in that situation and me being a neighbor not even knowing and my not wanting to call the cops (I didn't think it was anything like they found, I just figured it is really tough raising a kid and add on top of that severe mental disabilities and it's even tougher). I should have called them earlier once the CPS reports I was doing over the phone didn't ever do anything."}

They apparently asked his wife's brother to come and collect the animals and get the key a long time ago back in August, but never followed up on it. He apologized and said he was sorry, he gave me two options, and asked if i wanted to keep his pets since i have had them for so long, or he will push his step brother to get the animals. Apparently the animals don't really mean anything to him or his wife which i feel is quite shitty. He apparently can no longer access his email, and passed me along a new email address/phone number i can use to contact him. But told me he doesn't have plans to return to Canada anytime soon. I mentioned the water damage, and he just said they can buy a new house or get it fixed when they get back. He was also quite confused and somewhat annoyed, about the lengths we went to get in touch with him. He didn't understand why we reached out the embassy. He then offered to send me a bunch of money to square away the inconvenience, and that was more or less it. I don't know if it is a cultural thing, however i feel kind of pissed off at how little he/his wife seem to care about the pets/his house. Anyways me and my wife are going to keep the pets simply because well i don't think ether of us can part with the dogs and his cat at this point."}

It's pretty easy to go to law school and, so far at least, be a pretty good lawyer. The hard part is running the business and minding the gate. That's the thing I didn't learn in law school. There is no one more valuable to an attorney than their staff. A good legal secretary keeps you on calendar and the riff raff out the door. A good paralegal keeps you on top terms with the clerks of court, filed on time, and the hard work completed. The mods on this sub are those staffers, maybe wouldn't be mine, but it's easy to see the good they do. Thank you all. Other attorneys, future or past or just hopeful like me, appreciate your office staff more. They carry your ass every day for nickels on the dollar."}

We are glad you are visiting. There are a few things you should know before you post here: **We lock update posts that do not contain additional questions**. There are two reasons for this. First, this is a forum for legal advice and if none is sought, none will be offered. Second, those posts were moderating nightmares filled with off topic ranting and pointless arguments. We welcome update posts - particularly when a poster reports that they used our advice successfully. Even when they are locked in r/legaladvice there is almost always a discussion of the update in r/bestoflegaladvice for your popcorn needs. **Nothing here constitutes the formation of an attorney/client relationship**. This is not a substitute for an informed local attorney. At best, the advice herein assists the posters in taking the first step toward resolving their legal issue. **We are not a popcorn sub**. We remove posts and ban posters who do not participate in good faith. We lock posts that meander off topic, devolve into pointless bickering, or result in too many reports to the mods. This is not to say that there isn't entertainment to be found here, indeed that is why most of us became involved in the law. It is fun. And when justice results, it is rewarding as well. **Our rules are in the sidebar to your right**. They are available in detail [here]( and our wiki is [here]( For those of you who want more popcorn and fewer vegetables we invite you to visit our sister subs /r/bestoflegaladvice and /r/legaladviceofftopic. **Shitposting and brigading will earn you a permanent ban**. We respond to the situation at hand and the laws that apply. This is not the place to grind your political axe or talk about what you think the law should be. If you want to change the law, get involved in local politics. **Personal anecdotes are not useful**. This is not the place to talk about how once your sister's roommate got out of a ticket by doing X. The fact that you have an anecdotal counterexample is not proof that the advice offered is wrong. **This is legal advice, not moral advice**. Sometimes we have posts on hot button issues such as abortion, child custody, rape, racial prejudice, sexism, and so on. People come here to learn about their legal options. Advice relating to their immortal souls can be found elsewhere on reddit, online, and at local mosques, churches, temples, and philosophy departments. Sometimes, however, legal advice is indistinguishable from life advice. Thank you for visiting our sub. We hope you enjoy your time here and consider subscribing. --- LocationBot 4.97 23/269ths | [Report Issues]("}

Admittedly I don't frequent here often because I'm a lawyer and my advice is usually \"go look up your county bar association and find a referral for X area of law and get a real consult\" but a few times where I noticed particularly bad advice (\"see a divorce coming imminently: open a bunch of joint credit cards to ensure you have access to funds!\") and had to message the mods directly to notify them to take the bad advice down. It would just be easier to let people comment and let the votes fall where they may.

Plus calendar usage options just isn't a protected class so on top of all this it wouldn't really stand in the US or anywhere else that doesn't have a protected class for calendar usage.

Obviously the default advice here is \"you can get a free public defender here are some links Reddit can't help you here etc\". But here's the thing: apparently there is no right under the Indian Civil Rights Act to have a public defender in tribal court. The right only allows the defendant \"at his own expense to have the assistance of counsel for his defense\" for cases under 1 year in jail. Good fucking luck trying to find free legal aid that both is capable of dealing with tribal law and can even practise before the court OP was going before. Especially considering OP alleged that the court was corrupt and predisposed to find him guilty because the guy who accused him was a prominent tribal figure. He can be sentenced to jail for an entire year without any legal representation to stop it."}

He is a doctor.", "content": "This is in north Texas. Hey so I must apologize if this post is jumbled a bit. I started typing it up in Word yesterday before my date and forgot about it before finishing it today. I think my boyfriend has been secretly drugging me for a while now and is gas lighting me. I know this is going to be hard to explain, but I have been having gaps in memory that I have been explaining away as being tired, or overworked, or whatever else. I was going to ask my boyfriend about it, since he is a doctor, but then I started to notice that this seems to happen when I go on dates with him. I know it must be crazy, but I have woken up with dried semen on my breasts several times with no memory of the night before. I know its him as\u2026 well I wont get into specifics but he likes that kind of thing more than other guys would\u2026 The first time it happened was when we were drinking and I wrote it off as too much to drink. We get drunk and have sex all the time so its not a big deal to me. But then there were a few times when I KNOW we were not drinking. I decided to break up with him over it only to suddenly find myself on a date with him a few days later. I had not yet had the conversation to break up with him, but planned on it next time I talked with him. I remember being at the restaurant, but nothing before that. My car and his car was in the parking lot too so I was confused. I decided to play along when he asked me to come back to his place. After 3 days at his place I remembered everything so I was started to trust him again. Knowing he was an ENT I know it wont be his forte but he is a doctor. I was going to ask him about my issues when he randomly pointed to these red bumps on my thigh and said I should be treating those sores. I had completely forgotten they were there. These little red bumps that look like needle injections that got infected. I got so freaked out he mentioned them that I decided to leave. The next day he came over to \u201cCheck on me\u201d and I remember waking up in bed with more dried semen on my chest. Then today he met me for lunch saying we had agreed to meet. I never agreed to me with him and would never want to. He does this all the time, saying we agreed to do something I have no memory of. I am sick and tired of it and want him punished. This has started to affect my work life as well as I start to get paranoid when I see a boss walk into a room after making eye contact with me. I get paranoid that they are about to fire me. My friends also state I have been acting strangely and out of character. I have even begun to lose sleep and sleepwalk when I do. Is there a way to have blood work done to see what kind of drug he is using on me? I do not want the police to blow me off and push me away as some crazy lady so I want to be damn sure when I go to the police."}
