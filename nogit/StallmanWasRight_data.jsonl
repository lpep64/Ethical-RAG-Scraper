Two were pictures I uploaded myself, one was a road trip I tagged with friends, one was sharing the remembrance of a friend who passed away in 2015, and one was [a rickroll]( I'm not exactly ashamed of those things and the low posting activity means I'm not flooding the world with information about myself. For the pictures, I highly curate what I do and don't allow other people to tag me in. Once had a close friend take a picture of me where I was sarcastically flipping someone else out of frame, and he tagged me in it. Within fifteen minutes my father had given me a phone call asking me about the picture. After that, no one can post on my own timeline without me approving it first. As for co-workers... I don't friend co-workers until after I've left the company, and secondly I've only friended one co-worker in my lifetime. It's really all about how you use the platform.

My gripes with advertising come from a slightly different angle. In general, the abstract pattern of modern successful advertisements is to 1) present the viewer's situation in a way that induces anxiety in them, and 2) offer a remedy (be it a product or a service) for the anxiety that you just created. The marketing industry is up to speed on psychological science, and they've since long figured out that this is the best way to persuade people to consume their products. This makes advertising harmful and stressful to the viewer, regardless of whether you actually consume the product/service or not."}

Downvoting due to disagreement and flair is a lot more rampant there than anyone else. On the CFB sub, I'm able to have in-depth discussions about questionable calls without getting immediately downvoted into oblivion. The moderating is also a lot more lax than NFL. That has both upsides and downsides. I think NFL has better, more level discussion, but doesn't have nearly as many highlights as I'd like to see."}

You buy used products that people want to get rid of after buying shitty novelty products. You pay a fraction of the original price, and you get well made products with actual quality and proven longevity. I have a hand blender older then me, which means it's 40+ years old. It works just fine. I've taken it apart in order to clean it, which was really easy to do, because back then, they were *designed* to be taken apart as easy as possible. It looks almost good as new now. And I like to stress: This is not an exaggeration. It actually looks surprisingly good - taking in mind that it was the main blender for my mother, who was a house wife and did everything herself in the kitchen, which means this blender saw heavy usage over at least 2 decades. Still working just fine, looking good. And on top of that: I recently bought addons for this device, because it has a place where you can apply other things that need a motor for rotating things. All of those addons were equally easy to take apart and clean. Also, I've bought a high quality deep fryer made from quality materials, also easily taken apart and repaired. For 10 bucks. For people who want high quality products, it is kinda a nice time. Edit: Forgot to add: The kitchen itself, meaning all cupboards and the oven+stove is also older than me. It is the first kitchen my parents ever bought. The same is true for the whole thing: Easy to take apart and clean, still looks surprisingly good despite being heavily used for decades. It is fucking ridiculous that we throw away so many things that **are still working perfectly**, and not only that... they are even better than the things we **buy to replace them**. Maybe it was a slow progression downwards, but it is easily seen by anybody getting hold of older products **and** having at least a bit technical knowledge. Those things were well made and well designed, with the intention of being good to use. Not with the intention to make short term gain."}

So yeah, the company starting a revolutionary change in its development work met with deadlines dictated by outside forces is a dangerous combination. In general though the software update is not necessary for the working of the device. The part that actually controls the hardware is usually adapted from the older devices and works just as well. Btw most of the engineers and developers work in Germany and Germany in general is more skeptical about data collection, connected device etc than most countries.

So, if, for instance, you load it up with a whole heap of absorbent towels it might take 40 mins to run the cycle - it is often quicker to just do two smaller loads.

I bought a sound system from a German manufacturer 15 years ago. I later read that they were bought by a Chinese company. The brand though hasn't changed a bit. In the case of Siemens household appliances, they were always manufactured by a joint venture between Bosch and Siemens, each had a 50% share. That also means that both brands share a lot of internals, sometimes being nothing more than a different design and interface. I think the takeover by Bosch was a good thing though, as Bosch is not a publicly traded company (it is a trust and is supposed to only pay out to charity) and has no obligations to pay out dividends to shareholders, unlike Siemens. They are not as aggressive in driving up profits, which is why Siemens sold the low margin appliances department in the first place."}

Such as $10,000 for a tool to hook up to your dishwasher so you can clear an error code like we got in the auto industry. It's how they do it now and its rather in line with the GDPR in terms of not actually solving the underlying issues while claiming it does so shut up and stop wanting more. GDPR did a good job of getting people to shut up, so I see no reason why industry would oppose such measures in other vocal sectors like repair or planned obsolescence. Give the people a tiny concession and they go back to sleep for *years* as you continue down your path of abuses before they notice what you did."}

In this case, each client publishes its own data, there's only one party interested in that data, and that party manufactured the device and wrote all the code that runs on it. Blockchain means expensive leader selection systems to make it difficult to predict who will become the write leader, plus copying state to every node.

There's a reason cryptocurrency is basically the only major use case for it. When building secure tech, you *absolutely do not* use every cool sounding tool you can get your hands on. You use what works. The more stuff you add, the less secure your system is. You're suggesting we use blockchain to send data from people's IoT devices like fridges, to the parent companies of those fridges. That would mean every fridge would have to send data to every other fridge, just to ensure the data got to the company correctly. That is *all* adding blockchain would do. Blockchain is **not** simply encryption. It's a method of verifying that data is correct, **not** secure, **not** private. For simple analytical data, regular encryption is fine. It only needs to go from the device to the company. Blockchain will add nothing. It doesn't help anyone to waste thousands of dev hours to develop a decent blockchain based data logging system, since worst case scenario, a handful of fridges report bad data. You know what you do in the case of bad data? You either tell the device to send it again, or the device just sends all the data again later. You could have it set up to report data back every day, and it could send several days worth of data just in case. Analytical data is very tiny, a few kilobytes per day for most programs. There is no \"authorisation problems we have\". Literally, just encrypt the data, and send it to the company. It's that simple. It's secure. It's reliable. Worst case scenario, the IoT device has to send it again. Look, blockchain is a buzzword. Lots of politicians and corporate executives throw it around as such. They act like it's the future of everything, because the average person has no clue what the fuck blockchain means. They just know bitcoin is worth a *lot* of money, and that it's built on blockchain. This means they'll assume any software using blockchain is inherently high tech, and therefore better than its competition, even if it's far from that. Blockchain does not solve any authorization problems. Blockchain does not solve any encryption problems. Blockchain does not solve any privacy problems. Blockchain does not solve the vast majority of security problems. Blockchain is used by cryptocurrencies because they need 100% reliability that if a transaction is made, it was supposed to be made, they need to be certain that nobody can just say \"hey, X just sent me 100 BTC\" without anyone denying it. Blockchain makes sure everyone verifies a transaction so only X can send his BTC. This is the only thing blockchain does. It solves a very specific security problem. Security, privacy, encryption and authorization are all very different things, that's why they're different words. For an IoT fridge, the only thing that matters is privacy, which in this use case, requires encryption. Authorization is irrelevant, the IoT device will likely have a hardcoded URL or IP to send the analytical data to. If it gets a \"send data again\" request, it will just send it to the hardcoded URL, no need to send it specifically to the same IP that gave it the data request packet. Security is irrelevant in this context. The fridge should be secure, so that people can't install their own shit to watch your analytical data before it gets sent out, but that issue is solved by firewalls, keeping SSH closed, using up to date secure kernels, and a few other tactics. Blockchain will *not* improve security. Also, one last note, before you start thinking \"wait, blockchain means 100% reliability in accurate transactions? Then it must be the future of voting!\", understand why that's insanely dangerous. Blockchain could, in theory, make voting machines basically perfect. But there isn't a chance in hell that would happen. Voting machines today are already likely to be compromised. They're old, and insecure, and they're entirely closed source. It would be very easy for the UI button for 10% of voters to say \"Good Person\", but when pressed, actually sends the data for a vote on \"Dictator\". Paper ballots are still the only secure way of handling votes. You have people from several parties, all of which have a vested interest in catching the others cheating. You can't count paper ballots if you use a fully digital voting machine. Hell, even if you use a paper ballot voting machine, if the voter doesn't get to see it, you can't prove the paper ballot was written accurately. If voting machines were on their own completely physically separate internet exclusively used for voting, with end to end AES encryption, with 100% open source software, including the OS, and 100% open source hardware, with dozens of external security audits, with no remote updating, with paper ballots that are counted on-site and the numbers uploaded via a different method (e.g.: real internet, mail, phone, etc..) for verification, *then* blockchain would benefit it. If even one of those things is done incorrectly, then the security of the whole machine should be put into question, and then blockchain does more harm than good, it would make people think the machines are secure even when they aren't."}

The ISPs are invited (or in some cases paid) to \"cache\" the third party service within their own Network. This results in less outgoing traffic and therefore significant less costs. Netflix, Spotify and Facebook are all very active in aquiring this deals. But any company could if their traffic is significant enough that they (and the ISP) would benefit from it. This is just a result of a free market really and allows the growth of the internet as we know it. Without peering we would run into more serious networking issues with every new streaming technology. ISPs more or less just pass this savings along with those who profit from it (with a big extra fee, business as usual). It doesnt make sense to pass the saving to anyone when most of the traffic is still not peered. The other thing many seem upset is something along \"having one service with \"free traffic\" is exactly the same as charging for traffic to the competing service?\". Which is way to simplyfied. See it as \"prepaid traffic\" these content providers think it is worth to them to pay for your traffic. Netflix earns from that with more subscriptions, Facebook with more Ad traffic. Different traffic that has not yet been paid for obviously has to be paid by someone. Its like free newspapers vs. paid newspapers. One one just offsets the cost away from you. Still nobody is charging a premium for paid newspapers once free newspapers are etablished. This is more or less what i wanted to say. I would be glad if we could not use the phrase \"Net Neutrality\" for everything that we deem unfair. We should reserve the word for its original use case in order to not devalue the laws we have (or not have)"}

To make an analogy: Your gas station is giving you free gas if you drive to a certain location. The road is still free for everyone, no other driver is impacted by that. If this gas station would block a lane and only let people drive on it if they pay for a \"fast lane\", then other drivers would be impacted. That would result in non-neutral roads."}

I am certain nobody official asked them to do so, but beeing a ISP in the professional space this traffic may was significant enough.

And nobody thinks that they're great either. We all know that they're companies. And companies exist to make a profit. If net neutrality fails then there's two most likely outcomes. 1. Internet gets seperated into packages. Some browsing is more expensive/cheaper than others. 2. People riot, companies that package internet will move over to companies that don't. Making certain internet access cost different amounts than other is always a bad thing. Even if (In this case) It seems like a good thing. Losing net neutrality for a saving might seem great. But if we've lost net neutrality we can't possibly defend if they want to do the reverse, make everything more expensive except for X site. Honestly, that's what happens here. You can look at it like having 10 Gig extra for one site, or you can look at it as paying too much to browse sites that AREN'T in your package. Mobile providers like might be a small deal. But in America there's plenty of places where you only have 1 possible internet provider. If that provider decides to throttle internet speeds to youtube and make a package that gives you 10mb/s faster speed to youtube, then you're stuck with that. Net neutrality ensures that you get what you pay for, regardless of where you are. Another thing you might've not noticed is the following: Look at the packages. Are you missing anything? I sure am. The video bundle for example. It only has netflix, youtube twitch and an icon I don't recognize. No doubt they have a deal with netflix. But if you're subscribed to Vimeo you're screwed. This also manipulates shit like that. People who browse reddit might want to switch over to tumblr because their internet bundles support that a lot better. There's literally no way for a smaller competitor to youtube to come up if everyone can only 'afford' to use youtube. There's literally no reason to give out free stuff for the ISP. And this isn't exactly free either. Honestly, the argument that ISP's can pass 'savings' onto consumers isn't exactly honest either. Especially considering that it takes[ fractions of a penny]( for ISP's to provide a gigabyte of data to us. A cost that goes down by 15-50% almost every year. It takes very little for companies to decide they can get away with raising prices. You've found one good example of consumers actually 'saving'. But Net neutrality is a safeguard too against price increases for no reason. If one Major company decides to offer packages with faster internet for an added price, soon other companies will too. ISP's and mobile carriers are an oligarchy. Almost all power is in the hands of two or three companies. They've been running the show for years. The fact that you get the occasional free gigabyte of data every now and then doesn't mean that you're not massively overpaying."}

When the package only interests a small amount of people i would say its unfair to split the costs on all customers to provide a more unified service. > But in America To clearify America is a lost couse IMO. They removed the law base for net neutrality, so again this is very much their own issue. Here in europe we have laws and we use them. This is why i take issue with this all. If we start blaming common legal business practive as beeing something that is illegal anyway, we devalue the illegal thing when it may happens at some point. I know the situation in america is really bad. But this was already the case before net neutrality became a topic. The issue is lobbying and monopolism backed by govs from what i can tell. > Look at the packages. Are you missing anything? I sure am. Like how it is unfair that Facebook has a unlimited Advertisment budget but a small startup doesnt? This sounds like we discuss society fundamentals here. The way we are living in our world there is no way around this. Do you think Zuck would have complained about this issue when it were MySpace in these lists and he was just starting out? No he would have set himself the target to force MySpace out and himself in. Gladly this is why we build all this infrastructure for the smaller ones to get money, this is also why every startup is talking about raising money these days. Also its fair to note that usually the content providers go to the ISPs and not the other way around, because they profit just as much as the ISP does. Every website that has enough traffic (and therefore cash flow) is able to join, every website that doesnt have this kind of traffic is unlikely to run into a issue anyway. > There's literally no reason to give out free stuff for the ISP. Customers maybe? As said above some ISPs actually care about their customers because in some countries ISPs have real competition and all. > Especially considering that it takes fractions of a penny for ISP's to provide a gigabyte of data to us. A cost that goes down by 15-50% almost every year. This is true, while the whole article describes how the numbers are not accurate anyway, it does not take into account what amount of maintaince is needed to provide high traffic connections. Or the security & monitoring technics we dont know about. Fact is they save money, if the package prices are fair is a very different topic. Then again what in business is _fair_? You charge what customers are willing to pay and not cost + your cut. > If one Major company decides to offer packages with faster internet for an added price, soon other companies will too. Wait isnt that the business model we had ever since broadband? 20mb/s = this price, 100mb/s = this price. I assume you mean more like in this case where _some_ websites will have faster traffic? Well then i can happily say this is illegal (in all countries i care about that is), and as long as we keep Net Neutrality serious and dont use it like a throw away term for everything we deem unfair it will keep illegal for forseeable future. > ISP's and mobile carriers are an oligarchy. Almost all power is in the hands of two or three companies. Honestly for me this sounds like you are frustrated with your personal situation. I feel sorry for you, but again this has nothing to do with net neutrality or the future of the internet. Most modern countries act very careful with these laws and use specialists to explain the old politics what is even going on. Right now in the EU there is not really a reason to think that this will chance anytime soon. If anything it will get more restrictive in benefit for the customer, as it did the last years. And many countries / markets find a way to work around the \"oligarchy\". Take Switzerland we have essentially 2 big ISPs, but still about 100 small ones. The mobile market may has 3 big players, but there are ~10 sublicensers who drive the competition. Other than beeing limited by laws (or whatever prevents new ISPs from happening in the U.S.), these companies are limited by their own marketing abilities, therefore real competition and high customer satisfaction."}

In Thailand was this mostly marketed as cost control for kids and teens. I really have a hard time seeing any issue with any of that. Its not like other providers would be able to provide significant cheaper traffic, they just safe on costs with specialized peering and pass that on to the user. Edit:// May the people in here dont understand this peering stuff? See Spotify for example: they have servers all around the world, usually direct within ISPs. This allows significantly safed costs for ISPs so they are able to provide unlimited packages for cheap. For example Imgur is not at that level yet and providers simply are not able to cut on costs, they too have to pay for the traffic."}

However the point is that this is not favoring, at least not by law. I know there are dozens of points in this thread how it is favoring because !X = Y, but it is not in pretty much every implementation of net neutrality laws. If you get access to Facebook and MySpace with the very same condition and additionally can choose to get more Facebook or more MySpace (or both) for less money it is completely up to you to do so. Nobody is forcing anything on anyone, no other service will suffer because of the additional traffic you **bought**. Simply said, it neither: * blocks against payment * slows down * speeds up * or does favor anyone under normal conditions So it has nothing to do with Net Neutrality. If you'd had to buy the Facebook package to even access Facebook, were able to buy access to faster Facebook or even just when the ISP decides Facebook now has traffic priority it is clearly against net neutrality. Hence even if the ISP just throws unlimited traffic for specific services at you it is illegal in any law i've read (because that very well would be favoring), hence my argument that these laws are actually not that bad."}

But i care a lot. However this is my whole point. I dont know what problem the U.S. exactly has that i read about this issue so often, but other countries dont. Now they also opened the option for ISPs to not care about Net Neutrality as well. This however does not make: * ... the linked example anything related to net neutrality. This happened in a environment where net neutrality is pretty stable and a given law. This should be no point of the discussion. * ... it unfair to charge for services users are willing to pay, as long as base neutrality is given. * ... it unethical to to offer packages for specific use cases that are reasonable. (i.e. offering generally unlimited traffic can easily be abused, offering traffic to facebook for free can not but targets a specific audience) * ... help monopolies more than any other current structure within the free market does. * ... entitle you to free traffic of any source just because one source prepaid part of your traffic What i take issue with is that this thread simple destroys any lines between business and net neutrality. If we label everything a net neutrality issue that isnt we essentially devalue the net neutrality we have now (or dont have) which makes our future discussion base worse. Neither your example nor the thread are about Net Neutrality (yours is market regulation, the thread about business practice and third party peering) still this is what everyone is talking about.

At least thats what i've seen in countries i've lived. However there is no wasting redudancy and not more hardware necessary than it would be anyway. Having all digital cant be directly compared to having to physically move water around. The point of having multiple ISPs are more specialized packages and more competition.

I fully agree that Net Neutrality is a perfect base to solve many of these issues, however the issue most people in here seem to actually have are bad ISPs (usually because of a lack of competition) because Net Neutrality is given and evolving anyway (except in the U.S. were it just falls apart slowly, but then again this thread shouldnt be about net Neutrality because this happened in the EU where it is given and evolving)"}

Take everything I said here with a grain of salt. I am not the end-all-be-all for this information. The point here is that because of how entrenched Tesla's software is in the operation of the vehicle, there could be bugs that would be extremely dangerous. Most cars aren't like that. In most cars, the driver still has direct, mechanical control of the vehicle. Even if you have a car that will park itself, you still have direct control of the car - you can easily overpower the steering motor. In a Tesla, your inputs are not directly controlling anything. You are asking the computer to do things. So there is potential for a bug to cause your input to be ignored. In that case, I can understand a mandatory update."}

Most safety-critical machines and mechanisms don't rely on software for said safety, even if they *use* software for convenient operation. Security doors that protect valuables and run on software will fail open (mechanically) if the software crashes or bugs out, to avoid trapping humans. Security doors that protect something like military installations do the opposite, as trapping a human is considered (by the people who decided on that design, at least) less of dangerous than allowing whatever is being protected to fall into the hands of others. (Good) elevators will detect a fail state in their software and apply brakes mechanically and open the doors. My point is: There is no reason why the Tesla *needs* to be designed with digital input only. I'm pretty certain that a steering wheel can be designed switch from one mode of operation (digital) to another (mechanical or hydraulic) automatically upon a software failure. The same goes for all other input components. And honestly, perhaps they shouldn't even be digital inputs in the first place, even when the car's software is functioning normally. I don't see how the benefits could *possibly* outweigh the risk."}

Installing a deadman's switch and then not holding it on is the same as installing a regular switch and actively turning it off."}

Now Tesla has a car that in addition to being a car that you can own and drive, ALSO has a feature to drive itself. Problem with the self-driving feature? Possible health or legal liability. Then disable that feature. The car reverts to simply being a car that you can own and drive. Like Mitch Hedberg says. \"Escalators can never break, they can only become stairs.\" People on this thread are failing to understand that the 2 layers (standard driveable car and Autopilot) are separate and distinct. They are not inherently dependent on each other, although Autopilot should not work if the car is not driveable. Legally, you still have to have a driver's license to operate a motor vehicle. This means that you know basic functionality of cars, and rules of the road. You don't get to drive Teslas without a license due to autopilot. That license imparts responsibility to you as the driver of the vehicle."}

At first I liked the progressive nature of it, how it made people more open, more transparent and more social. I like if I can meet anyone in the city and I am able to contact them instantly electronically, so it makes people more friendly and social, which is very progressive and good. However with every form of good there are limitations, there is that saying \"too much good hurts\". Well as much as I liked this initially, this has grown out of control, and it's usefullness has ended and is now weaponized against us. Transparency and a social culture is good, but not like this, not in this shape not in this amount, and especially not controlled by totalitarian systems. Now the technology is getting weaponized and turned against us by totalitarian forces. And it doesn't really matter now whether it's China, North Korea, the UK or the US, anyone who gets a hold of this technology will become a totalitarian hellhole, especially for people living in the cities. It will be absolutely totalitarian to use your own good will, amicability and transparency against you to exploit and abuse you. Then you unfortunately have to give up these utopian ideals and get real. You know it would be nice to have a society full of cute furry kittens, if everyone would be like that, then we could have a nice and friendly society. But if some people are wolves that would hunt you down because you are too cute and too weak to defend yourself, then you have to give up your friendlyness for the sake of survival, you would have to turn from a kitten into a fucking sabertooth and fuck the predator wolf for your own survival. This is why I don't believe in utopias, as much as I would like them to be true, they always end up horrible and in the end people will become bitter and start infighting once shit hits the fan.

High-frequency bands for 5G can handle multiple gigabits of throughput. If that was located such that your stuff could connect to it, it would allow you to use that rather than home wifi. The reason that's not going to happen is that these bands have similar or worse (due to being higher frequency) range, penetration, and signal quality issues than your normal wifi. So your cell provider would need to put up an access point at basically every house. Note that a number of providers are doing that... embedding an AP in each streetlight down a street. ... How much of the US is dense enough to justify that? Everwhere else, the options are - Provider runs a networking line to your home, into your router/AP, and it delivers internet - Provider runs a networking line to your home, into some device outside the front, and it delivers internet. The gains there are... not really existent. Oh, and it would also require cell providers to stop overcharging so badly for data transfers. Reddit users over-represent data use, but my router burns like a TB/month for the household it serves. It doesn't matter if ATT's tech *can* supply that, if they're going to charge $10k/month for that. ---- In practice, it will make it technically practical to use cell-provider hardware for everything if you live in an super dense area which they've decided to wire up like that. Where the technology really shines is ultra-high-density event spaces. 50k people in a convention hall or sports stadium? Putting dozens of 10gBit-aggregate-class line-of-sight networking access points around the ceiling is perfect, and will let everyone actually use their phone."}

It's really hard to imagine nefarious uses for identifying contaminated waste streams. I guess you could use data byproducts to estimate populations, or as part of a model to predict attributes about a person, but this would be such an inefficient way to go about it. Even stuff like better transit... counting people on the train and estimating their arrival to see if the bus should wait for people connecting, that seems less invasive than TNCs, and better for the environment and saving time for people.

It is nothing that WiFi does not already do. Except that you don't share the edges of your wifi signal with neighbors and people who are passing by. If it did like some want to do it the potential privacy and security exploits could be disastrous. Someone could drive up close enough to your home to connect to your picocell/femtocell placed in your living room and download highly illegal stuff. Another thing to worry is that this is the first time I am concerned about health effects if legislators don't severely limit the antenna power limitations. And if they do, again, it's pretty much wifi. I am not against all of 5G, some stuff seems nice. But putting phone cells in everyones home seems like overkill and most people would use it mostly for stuff that wifi already does very well. On the other hand this might be a kick in the nuts for some to finally start implementing ipv6 to homes as most mobile telephony is going to ipv6. Another good thing is that there is too much fiber and ipv6 to be laid up and implemented before this might become a dominant technology(at least outside silicon valley)."}

Each of these settings controls a range of functions, the amount and timings of hot and cold water, spin cycle and direction including ramp up speed and spin time plus of course when to apply soap, conditioner, etc. The other part is modularisation of the machine, I can plug all sorts of things into my computer and it'll instantly recognise and work with them - it doesn't matter how big my screen or how large my drive the computer will work with those components, washing machines not to much - if you don't get proprietary part number 23432 then it simply won't work, sure you can modify and bodge but it's not often simple however using a basic microcontroller like the raspberry pi it'd be trivial to switch out the drum for a larger one and simply change the settings so it works out everything differently -maybe you'd need to change the motor to power it of course but that wouldn't be a problem, just change the appropriate settings and it'll time x amount of water flow instead of y amount of water flow and everything will work properly... So for example tomorrow someone came out and said 'this new nylon is fifty times stronger and half the cost to produce but to wash you should use a temperature of 70 degrees - this machine only does 20,30,60 or 90 but with an open source machine you could download a new program that set's the temperature to 70 and performs the ideal movements, maybe they produce a hydrophobic material that cleans perfectly if it's agitated in 60 degree water for five minuets and only requires a brief rinse -- again this washing machine would be useless and you'd have to upgrade the whole thing to get a new program, open source you could download something that only does five min at sixty then a brief wash and it'll have your things clean and dry in ten minuets. Or if you wanted to use it to fix dyes you could download a specialist program maybe even created by the dye manufacturer, they could be converted to wash other things when speced differently for example if instead of running water through the container of washing powder towards the start of the first warm cycle it actuated from a industrial container then you'd never need to add washing powder thus making it a much more useful device in a high-frequency setting -- devices like this are much more expensive because they're far less common but with an open api you could simply unplug one and plug in something else, change a few settings and it's doing exactly what you want it to. Then there's advanced features, the raspberry pi i mentioned earlier actually uses software for scheduling which was written as part of a PhD thesis and which is also used on the ISS, CERN and many other places - the same could be true of washing machines, if NASA happened to spend a billion dollars working out the exact best way to agitate dirt from clothing in earth gravity and devised a highly specialised program to do it then that would be available for use by every single person in the world (all NASA stuff is like that), if a clothing company works out the best way to wash their textiles then they can include a QR code on the label which links the perfect program for that garment - sure i'd never use that because everything i wear goes on the 'just fucking wash it' setting but a lot of people do wear delicate textiles and being able to ensure they're washed properly and safely is important to people. Then there's the connectivity options, again imagining the controller has the same functions as a five dollar pi zero you'd be able to set it to give you notifications through any medium - many of us don't care when the machine finishes because we'll get round to it when we get round to it but being able to beep your phone might be useful for people who are going to be in garden, or whatever -- the ability to chose exactly how you want it to react is entirely upto you when it's open source, include a speaker to play a chime or don't... Plus of course there's the ability to add sensors for diagnostic and control, you could just pull up a graph of the temperature during the wash cycle if you think there's a problem with the heating element --- which of course might be related to your local conditions, a washer in a block of flats drawing water from a overhead water tank that's heated in the sun all day is going to work differently to one drawing it through pipes running through frosty ground, an open source system could demonstrate that and account for it - swap out a modular component or turn up a setting, likewise if you live in a hard water area then you might want a module to remove minerals or etc. I could go on but i think you get the point."}

I recently saw a laptop from then and it was amazing how modular it was, being a formidable opponent even to one of the most modular laptops I have ever seen in the past few years, the MNT Reform. The MNT Reform is still more open though; I believe it has open schematics. But\u2026 that's not the only thing either. My old MacBook, although an absolute pain to replace the screen compared to the other old laptop I saw, is still much easier to open and replace the parts of compared to newer MacBooks. And my Dell 1907FPV monitors which I got used amaze me in their durability and quality control. 2006-2007 seems to have a lot of really nice electronics."}

That and a linux powered shower, I think i'll do that first because it's much simpler and would actually be a huge improvement on a regular shower - modern electrical showers are low tech for the 1950s, they literally just restrict the flow of water through a heated pipe - a raspberry pi with two ds18b20 temperature sensors, a single digital servo and a couple of relays and a couple of dials could increase performance massively - the rest of the hardware would be simple and it'd be absolutely trivial to create much more complex systems that are significantly more energy efficient you could even dynamically mix hot and cold water then heat as required thus getting the best of both systems and having the dial set the temperature to exactly what you want regardless of feed-in water temp and maintain it even when the feed-in temp and heater temperature vary - no more having to adjust the dial during your shower... and of course making it modular it'd be really easy to add other features and devices, water conditioning modules or water filtration and reuse cycles (great if you wash things like flowerpots in the shower, or just love a really long guilt free hot shower when you're already clean...). Washing machines are pretty simple, a couple of flow control valves and a motor basically - stick a decent sized motor controller on a pi and write the logic to time the water, add a few safety features and you've already got a machine capable of more than anything you can buy."}

Rural folk get subsidized in a very welfare-like way while poor people get SNAP welfare. The government buys from farmers and gives to the poor. It puts a floor price on crops so the farmers don't go under and it feeds the hungry. It DOES go against the theory of capitalism, and is a form of socialism. It totally is like welfare.... because they need it. The Right-To-Repair movement is popular among libertarians who believe in actually owning things. They typically lean Republican. It's also popular among tech-bros, who typically lean Democrat. Stallman would be some sort of transcended hippy libertarian. Ownership issues on farming technology is an intersection of a lot of different political backgrounds and the baggage is honestly making discussions about it difficult."}

We can't control society so when our freedoms get eroded piece by piece over time, it is our duty to understand the issues involved so that we can personally deal with the loss of freedom and so that we can influence the wider society and our politicians who lead and govern us. Stallman did this very thing so that he was able to explain why freedom in computing is so critical to us as individuals who own computers. It is this deep understanding that allows him to accurately prophesy his pessimistic ideas! Rather than wallowing in despair that our freedoms are eroding day by day, I think it's much more productive to honestly meditate on the issues and take a ethical civic stance to promote a free society based on cooperation and responsibility. If I fail, at least I can be satisfied saying I honestly tried rather than choosing to be defeated before taking any steps."}

But that *does* come with a tradeoff in privacy guarantees you can have, since you have effectively no way to know if the host is really that trustworthy. I think the way to go is something along the lines of Debian's [FreedomBox]( which tries to limit the exposure of the involved complexities to less savvy users. More work does need to be done in that area (particularly in facilitating bypass of CGNAT-style bullshit). Besides the obvious freedom and privacy benefits, a small self-hosted setup is likely to be a lot cheaper in the long run than managed hosting anyway."}

Two things that come to mind are: 1. TPM. Although this requires you to assemble your own server and set it up somewhere through colocation. 2. [Intel's Software Guard]( though this will require you to obtain a certificate from Intel. Regardless, just because something is technically possible doesn't mean that it is feasible. So it depends on who you want to protect your data from. If we're talking government, then any investigation will likely involve them taking the hardware involved back to their departments, which means they will unplug everything and plug it back in later (-> RAM is cleared anyway). If we're talking the company you're hosting with, then they would have to have the necessary technology to read bits from RAM already in place before you boot the system & access your encrypted drives (at least in case of dedicated root servers). With virtual servers it's a bit easier for them to do, albeit still difficult. I have yet to hear of such an attack successfully being pulled off btw. But yeah I would say rule of thumb if you have data that warrants you being worried about this type of attack vector, then you should probably build your own machine with TPM (even if you host it at your home, since if your adversary is this technologically adept and willing to go this far to get your data, then I wouldn't put breaking & entering past them)."}

In general, it'll cost more than Dropbox, Google or similar *per gigabyte*, since they lack the scalability (and subsidising from gathering your data lol), but most times you'll be able to dial in how much you need and therefore maybe end up paying less. I personally only use a couple of GB so I got a 50GB plan on [webo.cloud]( but there's maybe some other service that better suits your needs. Webo.cloud has a free plan which I happily used for some time before finally upgrading.

To my knowledge his account has not yet been restored. * OP does not seem to have been banned because of having broken his neck, but the timing is certainly convenient. It's also convenient for stirring up outrage from people who otherwise don't really care about Facebook bans impacting Oculus Store purchases. * The screenshots OP posted regarding his ban reasons: - the reasons they gave were one of the following: * Support for a violent and/or criminal organization or group * Credible threats / promoting self harm * Targeting other individuals on the site * Hate speech * Graphic content involving violence or sexual assault * Selling recreational or pharmaceutical drugs * OP had some pictures up on Reddit (which have, to my knowledge, since been deleted) where he was using an assault rifle. Some people have said that it was a machine gun but I was under the assumption that it was an AR-15 style rifle (I'm not a gun expert, though). This shouldn't be relevant but people have used it as justification for it being okay that he was banned. * Per OP, he only used Facebook for Population One streams, though he did Like some posts by the Boogaloo Boys and bought \"a sticker of George Washington holding a gun\" from them. * OP lost approximately $300 worth of purchased games and also cannot use his $400 headset. It is effectively bricked until it is factory reset and activated by someone with an active Facebook account. EDIT: Just saw that OP was unbanned [here]( though I echo the sentiments of one of the commenters: \"It sucks there has to be a massive outcry each time something like this happens just for a corporation to be slightly less shitty. I wonder how many accounts remain unnecessarily banned just because the user wasn't able to raise a sympathetic internet army.\" OP also said that his account was apparently [banned for profanity in one of his streams]( which also happened to not be listed in the bulleted list up above."}

Oh well, I guess I bought the games so I'm entitled to a backup copy, right? ;) Oh, I forgot about that! Yes, that could work too. But then, you don't get achievements or anything.

Oh, I get it now. I didn\u2019t realize you were a Trump supporter because generally I expect conservatives to support gun rights. Huh. Maybe you just don\u2019t think OP shouldn\u2019t use guns because he isn\u2019t white and you just didn\u2019t want to say that aloud? Your instincts are in the right place because that\u2019s an excruciatingly racist thing for you to think. You should work on fixing your views if that\u2019s the case. Maybe you\u2019re a Trump supporter and corporate apologist who just doesn\u2019t support citizens owning guns. If you want to take arms away from the citizens but don\u2019t want to demilitarize and reduce funding of the police, then you\u2019re a fascist. That doesn\u2019t really feel compatible with Stallman\u2019s views. Either way, please stop being a fascist. Maybe you think all guns and weapons are bad. Great! At least that\u2019s a viewpoint that isn\u2019t founded in racism or authoritarianism. You should focus on reducing their use by the police and military first. We don\u2019t need the US to be any more of a police state. If we reduce arms carried by citizens while police are still shooting people for made up reasons, what do you expect to happen? Reduce our military budget to 10% or less of its current total (preferably 1% or less), reduce police funding to 20% less of current funding and use that money to increase funding for education, healthcare, and easy to access programs for people currently struggling to get by. Then, when SWAT teams taking out unarmed people in their own homes is a distant memory, you can take away citizens\u2019 guns. If you don\u2019t see that, you\u2019re a bit of an optimist and more than a bit naive. Either way, you should know that spitting on victims because they happen to hold views counter to your own sorta makes you a bully."}

Then the bigger farms swallow the smaller. American farmers have been consolidating and facing consolidation for longer than most farmers have been alive. Tiny-run-by-a-single-family farms can't compete and haven't been able to compete. And I'm saying this as someone whose family were farmers for generations until the generation before mine when people started to pull out. Nobody in my generation of the extended family is still working on a farm although one of my uncle/aunt's still do. When they die the land will probably either be sold to a larger corporate farm or be turned into housing as the nearby city expands.

So I'm all for it, but will they? Maybe they could, yeah. But if the only way to get rid of the patents is to worldonalize the entire industry, that kinda means the patents are important for that industry to function. I'm sure we'd still have cars (and development) even if we got rid of 99% of patents car companies rely on. With medicine you have to rebuild the industry into some kind of utopian world wide science project to be able to keep it.

In the same spirit Norin 10 based wheat strains were distributed for humanitarian purposes. Those genes and research plantings became fields and acres which fed hundreds of millions of hungry people. Sure they could have commercialized it, but they didn't and the world is better for it. I fail to see the magnanimous gift that Borlaug gave to much of the developing world as 'more valuable' if he had held the patents and milked it dry for some amount of riches. Other plants which have been patented are clearly of lesser value, having had smaller impacts on the world as a whole. For example: round-up ready corn courtesy of Monsanto, does have extensive copy protection. Its main function is to sell glyphosate. Much of that corn is used as animal feed or ethanol production. Because of subsidies per bushel this type of corn is overproduced on fields which could grow actual human food instead of inefficiently burning corn to make beef or gas. That product creates herbicide resistant weeds, organophosphate contaminated land, massive greenhouse gas releases (through beef production and ethanol) and corporate profits."}

I don't see governments stepping up and researching crops, so unless that happens we're kinda stuck with patents and enforcing them. Keep in mind that if farmers in those countries don't have to pay for improved crops, everyone competing against them is at a disadvantage) and one case of cotton maybe not performing as well as advertised? Also shitty countries being shitty: \"Various studies identified the important factors as insufficient or risky credit systems, the difficulty of farming semi-arid regions, poor agricultural income, absence of alternative income opportunities, a downturn in the urban economy which forced non-farmers into farming and the absence of suitable counseling services.[180][189][190]\". It's very sad and concerning, but for a company dealing with corrupt poor countries that's really quite ok. They could do better, but that'd be actively trying to help the situation (kinda like fair-trade coffee) and not just do business. I don't think there's enough to call them evil. Except for helping out those Indian farmers who got in trouble investing too risky I don't really see what Monsanto was supposed to done differently. And some of those \"controversies\" is just people protesting GMO because it's the boogeyman of 21st century. My understanding is that only three really good improvements on the situation would be: - make it so Monsanto has a real competitor. (solves nothing but the crops might be a bit cheaper. There'd probably be even more monoculture in Argentina and even more deforestation in Brazil, because that means higher potential profits for farmers). - make it so some world non-profit runs all the crop research (Argentina would still probably get their monoculture and Brazil would still probably deforest itself. Indian farmers might get a lot less debt, but the crop might still underperfom there, so maybe they just risk too much on it in a different way. But at least first world can replant their decorative plants and doesn't have to be weirded out by the fact that we now have plant law) - make it so there's no more poor countries full of uneducated people. Best solution all around hands down. And I get Monsanto isn't doing its part towards that, but not many companies do. Even fair-trade coffee is pretty much bs."}

Not everyone **wants** a distribution-based profit model, but unless corporations/the rich either pay more in taxes, or donate more, I see no other way. The same thing goes for software - Stallman's camp is incredibly underfunded (based on their stated goals). Look at the GlugGlug laptop - what it sells for, and it's hardware capabilites."}

Most open source software are paid by the developer it self. That makes the developer it self the investor. Profit margins being what ever the developer values. (ethics, politics, money, status ...) Actually free software developers mostly care about getting great software at minimal cost. They are often prepared to contribute some of their time to a project that involves hundred to thousands of developers across the world. None of them are paid yet they all profit from the low cost quality software that the collective team produces. After all there are two main ways to get/increase profits ... one is to charge for sales and the other is to reduce costs. See for example [LibreOffice who are we?]( See also [VideoLAN, a project and a non-profit organization]( This concept of collaboration (by consumers of a product or service) to reduce costs (rather than competition and profits through sales) has been around for a long time. See [Consumers' co-operative]( >>>> Consumer cooperatives are enterprises owned by consumers and managed democratically which aim at fulfilling the needs and aspirations of their members. They operate within the market system, independently of the state, as a form of mutual aid, oriented toward service rather than pecuniary profit. See also [Open-source economics]( >>>> Open-source economics is an economic platform based on open collaboration for the production of software, services, or other products. First applied to the open-source software industry, this economic model may be applied to a wide range of enterprises. Some characteristics of open-source economics may include: work or investment is carried out without express expectation of return; products or services are produced through collaboration between users and developers; there is no direct individual ownership of the enterprise itself. As of recently there were no known commercial organizations outside of software that employ open-source economics as a structural base. Today there are organizations that provide services and products, or at least instructions for building such services or products, that use an open-source economic model."}

So let's turn to the issue that this situation really concerns: does the output of a machine learning system infringe the copyright on items in the training set that contribute to that output? There are possible cases where it clearly would infringe. If a substantial part of the output is very similar to one item in the training set, no stretch is required to conclude that it copies from that item. However, people don't use machine learning system intending to get a part or a slightly modified version of some existing work. The aim is to mix, seamlessly, little bits of many training items. The items that play a role are more like artistic influences than like samples. To find these to be copyright infringement would be disastrous to the creativity that copyright is nominally intended to promote. The main purposes of copyright today is to keep some big companies rolling in dough, and any effect on artists is for politicians merely an excuse. For us, however, the question of what copyright law should say is mainly how to promote the arts without interfering with users' freedom. \u2014Richard Stallman"}

So straight up we are into fantasyland then. As above, the same argument could be made that any time a human writes anything down, that is copyright infringement as they are only regurgitating what they learned from a (very expensive) textbook. The problem you run into is that LLMs can do quite a bit more than regurgitate info. One has never been trained specifically on \"what should primalbluewolf's Friday itinerary look like\" and yet its quite capable of summarising it for me. You want to argue that they're harmful in a bunch of ways, go for it! You want to argue they're causing mass disruption to existing power structures, and demanding vast amounts of energy for the privilege of putting juniors out of work - be my guest. But please don't sink to levelling the copyright argument at them - it holds no water. Heck, you want to argue that copyright as a concept is flawed - Im with you there. Saying that a set of weights in a neural network that has learned material, counts as distribution of the material? That right there makes human reproduction illegal."}

Back in the days they were also able to manually claim selected videos, but I am not sure if it is still working this days as it was tedious and almost no one used that feature. Here is a back side of that DMCA bullshit, only wealthy and powerful people can really file a claim. For regular person to file a claim one have to either pay for DMCA agent to file claim for him, which is not only time consuming but also costs a fortune, or be ignored. Because even though you are technically allowed to file such claim, almost everyone will just ignore you. Because they know that you don't have fortune for an agent so you also don't have fortune to court process. And you can't sue them for legal expenses, only for damages which is not provable except very rare situations.

For example, DuckDuckGo is almost entirely populated with privacy-conscious users who generally hate Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook, so DuckDuckGo will find it more likely that you are looking for negative results about Mark Zuckerberg as well. In Google\u2019s user base, privacy-conscious users are under represented because many of them have moved to other search engines like DuckDuckGo or Startpage. This means that Google\u2019s search engine will learn most about what people search for not from privacy-conscious users, but from anyone else. These other people are much less likely to hate Mark Zuckerberg and are more likely to search for him because they have to do research on entrepreneurs for a school project, hence why Google thinks those results are more likely to interest you. I know that Google also personalizes results for individuals based on their search history and tracking, and therefore it SHOULD be showing you negative things about Mark Zuckerberg regardless based on your interests, but it can only do that effectively if it can track you. In your case, I doubt it\u2019s had many opportunities to track you. For example, I still use Google on occasion when I can\u2019t find what I\u2019m looking for on other search engines, and I also use YouTube, so it can track me a bit. Because of this, I got some negative suggestions about Mark Zuckerberg when I tested it, but still not as many as on DuckDuckGo. So, I do not believe that Google is purposely trying to make Mark Zuckerberg look good, the results are just different because the search engines have very different user bases teaching them what people are looking for."}

Instead of claiming something to be actually sentient, I\u2019ll just use the term \u201cperceived sentience\u201d when people begin to treat machines as if they\u2019re more or less sentient. Currently we\u2019re beginning to see some of that already, and most likely this trend will continue in the future unless nuclear fire (or some other cataclysmic event) swallows our society before that. The way I see it, robots and AI are going to play a more significant role in the future, and eventually people are going to resist that change. People might even resort to violence in order to maintain the status quo. Anti-robot sentiment could include the idea that robots take the jobs that rightfully belong to humans. Some sci-fi movies and books have already paved the way for the discussion about the rights of robots, so seeing that idea take root in real life would be very interesting. Once robots can be preserved to be a bit more sentient than our current creations, then some people can seriously start asking if it\u2019s right to keep robots slaves around. When that happens, I expect to hear more and more pro- and anti-robot discussions."}

In previous versions of Windows, you had to pay extra for Windows Media Center - the extra money covered the licensing costs Microsoft had to pay to some governing body for the rights to play DVDs. They did the same thing with the Xbox, which wouldn't play DVDs unless you bought a DVD remote control. It wasn't just so you'd buy the controller, but the cost of the controller again covered the licensing fee. Now, they still made a huge profit off it, which is shitty and they should stop, but they didn't just charge you for the sake of it. The point was that instead of adding the licensing cost onto the base price, they made it a separate thing so if you weren't going to play DVDs then nobody had to pay to license the DVD codecs. I don't know how HEVC works, but maybe this is a similar thing? Maybe instead of making Windows $0.99 dearer, they've made it a sort of addon?"}

Personally, I primarily use mpv for watching things, because I like the smoothness of the arrow-key skip functions. VLC (for me) tends to interrupt the video for a moment, and I've had issues with desyncing when you make a ton of short jumps. I would also suggest jacking up the caching settings. I use cache=1000000 demuxer-readahead-secs=60 hr-seek=yes Memory is plentiful, and letting mpv cache up to 1GB worth of content, as well as demuxing 60 seconds ahead, means that you basically never have issues with waiting, regardless of if you jump around in the file or are playing it from extremely slow network storage or media."}

With bluetooth itself, it isn't that the implementations are proprietary most of the time, but mainly that the protocol itself has notorious reliability and safety problems both in design and implementation (which is nontrivial). It has been a source of exploitable memory bugs, poor encryption and session hijacking. And the part I want FOSS or standardized is the control protocol used for the actual client/server work between the thin client and the compute node. Wireguard is just a reliable and FOSS encrypted VPN technology which could easily be used to create a point-to-point encrypted network atop of bluetooth, or any other IP networking technology. Basically relegating bluetooth to serving as literally nothing more than what wifi could. I would expect proprietary implementations of this client/server model to otherwise use some unreliable and probably-backdoored encryption. edit: The need for a secure and authenticated network is exclusively due to the assumption of a wireless component being wanted. A wired solution would be much safer and simpler."}

It's slightly confusing, but it seems like you buy the vest directly for $399, and it comes with a control module (a little electronic doohickey that's full of sensors and detects when the user is falling) that you have to make an account and pay for. You either buy and own the control module for $399, or lease for $12mo/$120yr. The purchase option comes with a 2 year warranty on the control module, while the subscription option has an unlimited warranty and they will send you new models every 3 years. So, if you're a stallmanite and you really want to own a high-tech airbag vest, you can just pay $800 and own it for life. The module does not need to be continuously connected to check your subscription status. You only have to pair it to your phone once per year/month, depending on subscription model. It's absolutely not performing a real-time check to determine whether to save your life. There's a comment in the linked thread saying that the airbag is disabled if GPS goes out. I found a more recent user manual that says that the airbag stays enabled if GPS goes out, but it may not go off in certain accident cases. It has an array of sensors and variables it uses to determine whether you are crashing, and GPS positioning is one of those variables. I'm unable to find any information about what happens if your subscription runs out mid-ride, and whether/how you are given advance warning."}

If that was the case, you would be correct. However, there are two primary alternative options: 1. Are you suddenly in freefall? That's, uh.. bad. A bit of computer with an accelerometer can figure that fact out pretty quickly. Incidentally, near the end of the spinning-disk-laptop era, laptops started doing this with their hard drives. Upon detecting that they were suddenly in freefall, they would park the disk heads in the safe-storage location, so when it hits the floor, the delicate parts are more protected. 2. Are you no longer attached to your bike? Also a bad sign. The neat thing about this metric is that we can figure it out entirely mechanically. Using something very similar to a dog leash.

If theres anything I hate about reddit, it's that it destroyed the soul of online communites and holds a big grasp over all online discussion. If you want a reddit in the hands of the people, use mastodon for inspiration. It's a successful twitter clone, and instead of being 1 website, it's a bunch of websites running the same software than connect to each other. The people who make the decisions are the staff of each mastodon \"instance\". While instances connect automatically if someone tries to follow someone on an a non connected instance, the staff can choose which ones are blocked. If a server gets too full to financially manage, or the users don't like the staff, they are switch to another one. Federated websites do have their own weaknesses, as there is no real stop except the government authorities on hatespaces being conceived, sure they can be blocked out, but those individual spaces can connect to other likeminded ones. One more common to a reddit-like website would be that even if the admin is corrupt, many people may stay because they want an active place to discuss things, so a decentralized reddit-like service will need to be designed with that problem in mind. Obviously things would need to be tweaked a bit for a comprehensive reddit clone, but if we want a free reddit, we need a decentralized one where different people are in control. Preferably with more customization."}

It's regulate or (inter)nationalize. Bubbles are something to watch. You can't make people listen to what they don't want to hear. There is a lot of nonsense out there I certainly don't want to hear about at all. Not just racists nonsense, but flat Earthers, anti-vaxers and all sorts. The role of traditional media is to process information so you only hear what is validated. Only they try to hard at being balanced and end up doing false balance, giving air time to nonsense they really shouldn't. Like damn anti-vaxers and flat Earthers.

Restraints on their hunting are crucial to preserve their ability to hunt in the future. Similarly allowing for people to advocate for the abolition of human rights in the name of protecting those rights may eventually lead to those rights being abolished. When tolerance has no limits, the Intolerant will inevitably win. Edit: I feel that clarification might be necessary here after all. I am not advocating for legal restrictions of intolerant speech. There are multiple ways to effectively shut down someone's attempts to spread their ideas that do not require legal force. Peer pressure, deplatforming, and/or potential empolyment repercussions should usually be sufficient to show that Fascist ideology is not acceptable in society. On an somewhat unrelated note, these types of methods are also very effective when comabting drug usage, history even shows that they are actually more effective than the legal ban methodology."}

Of course, to give this quote any real meaning, we have to know what they mean by \"reduced their hate speech\". In the datasets and methods section of the study, they describe a system of automatic keyword identification using py-sage for sage analysis (the methodology for sage can be read about [here]( but essentially is used to prevent overparameterization of words like of, and, the, etc.). They then took those words returned from the SAGE analysis and manually filtered them to determine if they were *explicitly* hateful. According to the study, among the words removed were the names of the subreddits themselves, references to the act of posting content (shitlording, etc.), and terms that are hateful but are \"frequently used in other ways in the broader context of reddit (e.g. 'IQ', 'welfare', 'cellulite')\". You can find both the automatic and manually filtered lists [here]( I believe they accurately contain a list of hateful words pertaining to those subreddits. Now what this study found was that the usage of these words in particular dropped by frequenters of the banned subreddits after they were banned. This study did not look for or find any drop in hateful sentiment or behavior beyond the direct use of words, so what I said earlier about these users \"diluting the hostile viewpoints into something more palpitable\" remains not only plausible but potentially more substantiated with the results of this study, as the users were found to still be posting hateful content but at a measurably lower rate when it comes to specific words. In the words of the study, \"We calculate hate speech usage as the sum of individual frequencies of each term in the hate lexicon and normalize it per post\". I have no study to back this next claim up, but I would believe that in general, users alter their speech per subreddit/community in order to have their content fit more agreeably with the contextual audience. Something along the lines of \"fat parents make fat babies, fatties should die\" in the fatpplhate subreddit may be relayed to another subreddit by that same user as \"Letting your kids get fat should be grounds for social services to forceably remove them from these disgusting parents. we would be better off as a society without them.\" I would argue that both statements have the same sentiment, but the later is entirely more coercive towards these beliefs than the former and thus sits at a major blind spot in the study. That said, the study concluded that hateful word usage dropped, that's conclusive. However, to draw the conclusion from this study that hateful *behavior* was curved, you would also have to conclude that there is no other way for one to be hateful than by using specific hate words, which I think we can agree is just not true."}

Critics argued that they were primarily an attempt to suppress voters who disagreed with the Federalist party and its teachings, and violated the right of freedom of speech in the First Amendment.The Naturalization Act increased the residency requirement for American citizenship from five to fourteen years.

A tolerant society can not be tolerant of those who would practice intolerance. That being said, I do not believe in \u201cfree speech\u201d as many in this community, and many liberals view it. I firmly believe that there should be hate speech laws, and people who say things that could be construed as racist or condoning violence against others should be dealt with. Part of our social contract as a society is that we abide by a set of norms. Those norms are violated at their most basic levels by fascists because they do not believe in them. Whether we deal with them through exile, jail, deportation, etc is inconsequential to the overall outcome of no longer giving them a place to practice their intolerant ideology."}

For the speech recognition to work, it needs to communicate with a backend; in this case, AWS for Alexa, but Google and Apple's Siri work identically. Even in the simpler case of a device being controlled by an app, there is no direct communication between your phone and your vacuum, even though they are on the same network: the messages need to travel all the way to they company's servers (which are likely hosted on AWS), and the device gets activated by a response back from the cloud service. This is insanely inefficient and fragile, but enables the conveniences the consumers were trained to crave. It's very unfortunate and very much avoidable."}

And the second is something that engineers are asked to do that is sometimes called glass in the chimney. The story goes that a bricklayer was building a chimney for someone who was known to not pay their bills. Like Trump! So halfway up the build he laid a piece of glass across the hole into the masonry and continued building the chimney. When the job was finished, the client refused to pay. When he went to light his first fire, smoke backed up and caused quite a mess for him in his house. he called the bricklayer to tell him he didn't do a good job and to come fix it, to which the bricklayer said you haven't paid me for the first job, so if you do that I will come fix it. The bricklayer arrived, got paid for the job, climbed on the roof, and dropped a rock down the chimney. Engineers don't naturally do this sort of thing, but engineers are only one part of a company, and companies that run IoT based cloud services sometimes want the ability to be able to brick their devices if they have to have in case of non-payment. Back in the day, I knew a lot of independent software folks who would do this, it seemed to get popular again once mobile apps got popular, because lots of people with ideas and no money thought they could bluff some programmers. I'm currently working on a system where we had this actual dilemma - we have IoT hardware that requires an internet connection. But this is much more of a critical safety industrial IoT scenario, so what if the internet disappears, or our services running in the cloud go down? We ended up going back to the customer and basically told them, if they want stuff on site to run no matter what is going on with their internet connection, or our cloud services, they're going to have to pay a little more because we have to build some new stuff and that just takes some time and man hours as well as the fact that the local hardware will have to be beefier to support the new requirements. Or they could accept the fact that they could have outages, extremely rarely, and we can ship next week. There are a lot of reasons, but doing stuff in the cloud is often much cheaper than doing it on the embedded end. Given a choice between a higher price point device, or a cheaper one with this small limitation, almost everyone chooses the cheaper one. \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af"}

I keep them until they die, or become too troublesome. Statistics can be used in all sorts of ways. If we look up the statistics on average wages, new car prices, home prices along with your average age of vehicles, you will definitely see that people have older cars now than they used to. That doesn't mean that they are \"lasting a lot longer\" per SE. It means that it is now inherently cheaper to throw an engine or transmission or two into it than to replace it (on average). Go anywhere where there is NOT a strict emissions standard and this will play out. Just because they are running doesn't mean they are lasting."}

Same is true for both old and new cars, but providing exceptional care for a new car is usually a lot more expensive than for an old car. Thing is, many people buy old cars not because of their supposed reliability, but simply because cheap. And said people will often cheap out on maintenance also, and therefore only provide adequate care.

My guess here is that some aspect of Google Cloud Services/Play Services shares a range of DNS names or IPs with Google Analytics. GCS is a collection of common app functionality (e.g. push messages) that Google offers to developers, largely in exchange for the ability to hoover up data associated with those actions. Many apps literally do not work on Android unless a device has access to GCS (via having Play Services installed, as it is , unremovably and by default on all Google approved Android distributions). Note that most reputable VPNs offer .apks that don't require GCS. Likely, NordVPN's app was mistakenly making a connection to GCS *blocking*, i.e. \"if this connection fails, there is a problem with the app, don't let the app keep doing things\". Hence, Adguard blocks Analytics/GCS, and then inadvertently blocks NordVPN. That is certainly a mistake, but it could be an innocuous done. (It could also be sinister.) That said, don't use NordVPN. The founder is shady, and they have a history of data leaks. I would never trust them to reliably protect your privacy."}

I tried so hard to use open source tools in my business and it only ever caused confusion. The time I spent making them work was so not worth it. I was always the kink in the pipe that sent \"corrupted files\", or I wouldn't be able to open files sent to me. Those things waste time on communication and troubleshooting, major time influences on any project. If you need to do some simple photo manipulation then something like GiMP is fine, once you move into shared editing, or source deliverables... Good luck. You're most likely just going to piss clients off. So while I wouldn't call someone who uses GiMP exclusively an amateur for that alone, I would say that they probably don't have a ton of experience working in the industry. You can be an insanely good designer or pro graphics artist that uses GiMP. That doesn't mean that you're good at business process or time management. Also I've been using both tools for over 10 years now. GiMP gives me a ton of issues over PS (not saying much), but it works on Linux so hey! These open source tools aren't always head and shoulders above the industry standard counterpart. They are all \"functional\" in terms of what the programs market themselves as. I dream of a day where someone or something overtakes Adobe, but I honestly don't see it happening any time soon, and it certainly won't be GiMP replacing PS. Trying to go all open source is a nightmare when you get into the business logistic side of things. My advice to you as a senior web guy, it's okay to hate Adobe, but don't let it cost you work. You're taking the courses you take for a reason, the reason isn't to use GiMP. Don't obsess over your tools, obsess over your project. People have been doing far more with far less for many generations. Just as an anecdote, and coming from someone who hires people in your industry, if we got to discussing tools and you were adamant about using GiMP on all design projects, it's easy to say \"this person doesn't get it, and is going to cost us time.\" Some people get caught up falling onto their own swords before they realize a little flexibility doesn't make them a sellout. It happened to me, I see it happen still, I'll always go out of my way to steer up and comers away from it. Save some of that piss and vinegar for the project or life outside of work."}

It'd be like a professional mover showing up to my house with a pickup truck and a UHaul trailer. * They refuse to use OSX or Windows, so GIMP is a default option as it's the best raster editor available outside of those two operating systems.

It's not a 1-person project; It's something that would require a small army of volunteers and years of development to get to the point where it would be in the realm of Solidworks or Fusion 360.

Let me preface that by saying I am a huge fan of there products, so full disclosure, I am a bit of a fan boy. I feel completely comfortable with JetBrains' subscription model because they are constantly adding features and improvement. Hell, look at PyCharm and WebStorm. They have a ton of different integrations with different frameworks, which come up super often in the JavaScript ecosystem. They also build in integrations with different system level technologies such as Docker or Vagrant. These alone are super helpful. Most of their editors are covered by the Apache license so they are fairly open source. I feel like they give you something in return for your subscription. I could be wrong about this though; thats just my take on it. This might be an unpopular opinion, but I think a subscription based model is much more appropriate for software then a large upfront license purchase. The reason being, is that this gives a financial incentive for the developers to provide updates and maintenance for the software. Where I see this model going wrong, is when the software stops working when the subscription expires. Instead, if the subscription expires it only should stop updates and support. I think it is important to remember that if we want to encourage companies release software as open source then we need to be willing to pay for it. ***Open*** ***source*** ***means*** ***free*** ***as*** ***in*** ***freedom***, ***not*** ***free*** ***as*** ***in*** ***free*** beer*** .

The explanatory model of ruling classes, and ideologies are a very high-level description and may not be a good explanation for certain kinds of phenomenon. Here's an example of what I mean: you *could* explain New World colonialism as some complex interplay of the dominant ideologies of the times (proto-capitalism, neo-feudalism, rationalism, religion/christianity, etc. etc.). OR, you could look at the map and notice that the major languages spoken in the Americas (English, Spanish, French, and Portuguese) just so happen to correspond to the European powers bordering the Atlantic (Britain, Spain, France, Portugal). That tells me that whatever the ideology and power systems (or whatever) were at play may have be inconsequential (or derived) from simple geography (i.e. a more fundamental factor). My point is that capitalism is a system that better exploits some fundamental forces than communism and because it's so much better at it - whatever power systems were above it *HAD* to align to it, as opposed to those power systems enforcing it on others. To put it another way, our ideological discussion cannot make a dent in the Sun burning out its fuel. If the Sun's energy output changes, that will drive societal change regardless what your ideology is."}

The bill increases criminal penalties for violations related to electronic surveillance conducted under color of law or false statements made to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISA court). The bill broadens the criteria for when a FISA court decision shall be declassified and requires the declassification review and release of such opinions within 180 days of an opinion being issued. The bill broadens the FISA court's authority to appoint an amicus curiae (an outside party that assists in consideration of a case) and expands such amici's powers, such as the power to ask the court to review a decision. Each agency that submits applications to the FISA court shall appoint an officer responsible for compliance with FISA requirements."}

However, even the parasitic lifeforms whom unfortunately lack that opportunity do have the opportunity to evolve beyond their pettiness. Do you know the story of The Giving Tree?

Libraries should only be allowed to circulate as many copies of a book as they own. However, digital copyright has been an issue for years in libraries. COVID-19 has brought it to the forefront because physical copies are unavailable. The biggest issue we see is that there is no industry standard for how digital long copies of books are owned. Some publishers allow libraries to loan digital copies for a set amount of time as many times as they want. Other publishers allow a certain number of checkouts per digital copy. In my opinion once you own a book it is yours in perpetuity. This should be for libraries as well. At one point Macmillan Publishing would not allow libraries to purchase copies of new releases for a set amount of time. They have relented on this point but it does show some of the issues libraries are facing when it comes to digital content and copyright law. Edit: I want to give some better examples of what I said in this comment and clear up my opinion on digital copyright. Firstly: different publishing companies have different usage rules when it comes to digital content. For example (these are not real I'm making them up on the fly) 1. Little Brown & Co allows their materials to be checked out as many times as you want in a two year period. 2. Penguin Random House says no you can only check this item out 50 times, and it doesn't matter how long it takes you to get to 50 checkouts. 3. Zondervan works the same as Little Brown but only allows only one year. This is messy and hard for libraries to keep track of. My opinion is that once a library purchases a digital copy of a book they own it. They should be allowed to check that one copy out as many times as they like, but they should be constrained by the number of copies of the book they have purchased. I think that purchasing only one copy and digitally copying it and giving it to 1000 patrons at one time is Piracy and wrong."}

The point is that the libraries are often unable to actually purchase five copies. Because the seller won't sell them five copies, or won't sell them five digital copies. Instead, they attempt to sell them a limited license to rent 5 copies 21 times each (as an example) -- which is insane. Past that, the library might have purchased its copies back when digital copies weren't a thing. People used to scan books (photocopy) at libraries all the time, with the cost to them essentially being tied to printing those pages. All of a sudden, this particular mechanism for gaining access to certain parts of materials is no longer acceptable -- what, because it's too easy for a person to do? There are also books that are no longer in print, etc. Part of the point of a library is to give people who cannot obtain items themselves access to the knowledge or information they need. The convoluted (and unfair) licensing terms people want to impose on libraries make it so that these entities cannot make smart decisions about which books to buy for their communities -- the licensing entities want them to have to pay per loan (whereas, in the past, a library could make a 'good' choice to buy a book that would be checked out a lot, this would now no longer be advantageous). While people are unable to physically go to libraries, I (personally) think the library should be able to loan a digital copy of any book they own."}

The idea being physical copies wear out, and libraries could loan one digital book to the entire world, one loan at a time. Similar with restriction interlibrary loans. Publishers want to deny that right via a special library license. Their justification is presumably that interlibrary loans of physical books take time (shipping back and forth) that limits the \u201closs\u201d to the publisher. Digital books are so much easier to lend remotely, that it causes harm to the publisher.

As the system stands currently, the only way to curb that is to have a license and not actual ownership of the e-book, which then makes it difficult to distribute by libraries and honest readers.

Digital content is forever, unless for some reason the files become corrupted. Also, my library still has books from when it opened...in 1906. Don't tell me a physical copy of a book falls apart after 2 years."}

Libraries are exempt from encumbrance of copyright after first sale. If media corporations don\u2019t like it, they don\u2019t have to sell to libraries, but that would mean missing out on a large market.

It was even debated during the founding of our country and the copyright provisions both in the Constitution and in the first laws written on the subject.

Provide exposure for books; access probably increases sales, see above point. I\u2019d like to see some studies on if lending out books leads to more publisher sales. I\u2019ve heard that piracy leads to sales, though that\u2019s something I haven\u2019t checked. Logically, it would make sense if it did lead to more sales, but it would also make sense if it didn\u2019t due to people lending instead of buying. Also, if you buy an e-book, the idea is that it lasts pretty much forever. But if you buy a physical copy, the assumption is that it lasts as long as it lasts. Why don\u2019t libraries fall under the same rules? In any case, if the interest of the publisher is actually so at odds with the public interest it\u2019s not great."}

TwitterAppCowould be free to pursue the same business model and moderation policiesthat Twitter is pursuing today (I can imagine Musk sticking withTwitterServiceCo, and the employees upset about said control being apart of TwitterAppCo).However, that relationship would not be exclusive: TwitterServiceCowould open up its API to any other company that might be interested inbuilding their own client experience; each company would:Pay for the right to get access to the Twitter service and social graph.Monetize in whatever way they see fit (i.e. they could pursue a subscription model).Implement their own moderation policy.This last point would cut a whole host of Gordian Knots: > >... ...."}

Whether it's just rhetoric remains to be seen. I feel like these sorts of statements are typically just PR. More importantly, centralized control of these platforms, by members of the billionaire class especially, is in my view likely to lead to policies that reflect their interests. Just as is the case for corporate owned news media. And Elon can't be the only one with swaying power over Twitter, can he? Advertisers and so on will always press for a business friendly, sanitized platform, and shareholders will insist that fringe/extreme views and content (subject to interpretation) be quieted by various means if the company's reputation comes under scrutiny for allowing them to persist (an unfortunate reality of the current political climate). As much as Musk might like the sound of free speech, I think there are institutional pressures, like the kind I just mentioned, which encourage censorship in the long term, just from a 'sensible' capitalist perspective. Moreover, he clearly is not a free speech absolutist, saying that _some amount_ of moderation should be on the platform (a disconcertingly vague remark), which entails some amount of interpretation by humans, who as we all know are prone to mistakes and biases. It also seems very likely wants to turn a profit on his huge investment, which further complicates the aforementioned problems. So I'm quite skeptical of these remarks."}

This is not a left-or-right issue. This is not even a discussion about whether propaganda and lies are destructive. Arguments in favor of censorship are a fascist position in which the state ought to be the final arbiter of what is true or not, and what can be published or not. In the past, the United States has used exactly the same logic to censor opinions on the Left. It will do so again. You invite the scorpion of censorship in the room, it will begin stinging everybody. I agree that the epistemological crisis of the modern age - how do we *acquire knowledge* and *know what is true* requires some engineering, but inviting censorship into the room merely appoints the state as the arbiter of truth and fallacy. In the past, the government has used its position to shut down anti-war speech, created the Red Scare (in its interest) and suchlike. By now we should have learned this lesson. Whether a platform should permit certain kinds of speech on its platform is worthy of discussion, but as Musk clearly is going to take a libertarian approach, the remaining argument by implication is whether the government ought to hold platforms liable for speech on those platforms. If you want to set fire to the whole building while trying to put out a grease fire in the kitchen, well, we're all going to burn if we hand this over to the government."}

Next time an Alex Jones or a Q coocoo person feels censored or offended, instead of pointing to a murky management, which will in turn point to anonymous shareholders as ultimately responsible for Twitter's direction, now they have a single target, to boicott, pursue, doxx... Elon Musk and his businesses and followers. People can give you whiplash with how they change their view of someone from Messiah to Traitor. Look at Disney (a traditionally mostly conservative company), how their taking a stand against a discriminatory law in Florida was taken as a declaration of war by Gov. De Santis and his followers, they are currently going berserk against Disney. Many of the people adulating Musk today will try to torch him unless he does exactly what they want. I think this might be too much hubris on Musk's part blinding him, and I kind of pity him. The best case scenario is Twitter not changing much or at all, except Musk is more exposed to attacks now. I hope for the best but Twitter users should prepare for the worst.

Sure, there are verified \"Blue Checkmark\" users, who are real people and brands who will suffer real consequences - whether in their personal lives or their careers - based on their speech. But the vast majority of \"users\" on Twitter are either bots, anonymous accounts (ie, not a bot, but also not tied to a person's name or other social media), or unverified people. These people have no incentive to participate in good faith. Anonymous users have a one-way shield against criticism and consequence that is not healthy for discussion, at least when that discussion is not moderated. When a user is anonymous, they can still say harmful things about groups that are NOT anonymous, with zero chance of retaliation. An anonymous user can say something terrible about a race - therefore doing harm to every real-life member of that race - but with nobody able to identify who the user is, the only risk to the user is receiving some angry comments that they're a racist. Heck, they aren't even at risk of a reply from someone else saying something racist to them. Want to spread disinformation? Set up an account, tweet a bunch of platitudes, buy a bunch of followers and start spewing nonsense. Heck, you could pose as a doctor and tweet about fake treatments. No real-life consequences if your disinformation gets someone killed. Even WITH blue-check verified users, all you have to do to shield yourself from consequence is buy enough bots/followers to retweet or like your controversial tweets - therefor shielding yourself from the argument that you said something terrible by pointing to the number of anonymous nobodies that \"agree\" with you. Without moderation or regulation, whoever has the most bots or alts-from-like-minded-followers gets their message heard. tldr; You can't have anonymity without moderation unless you want your platform to be a cesspool of edgelords spewing hate speech.

He doesn't actually eat us though - He's God, right? His needs are different. God feeds on Irony. So he made us, nothing but little irony factories, pumping out irony in spades. Like milk cows. Just as cows have been bred to maximize milk production, we have been spiritually bred to maximize irony output. And it is inescapable. The more you fight it, the more irony you produce. That's ironic right there, right? That's why we have religious wars. Nobody worships a God of War anymore - those people got wiped out thousands of years ago! By people who \"love peace\"! Maximum irony. Everyone preaches peace now. So now we have billions of people who preach peace, love, harmony, all killing each other. More maximimum irony.

There will be no shareholders. Twitter is being taken private and will be (as far as has been announced) wholly owned and controlled by Elon Musk. While I'm sure there will be advertisers, I don't think Elon Musk spent $44bil on a company that doesn't have quarterly profits approaching 1% of that number as a way to make money. I'm certain that if faced with the decision to maintain profitability or to run Twitter in a way that aligns with his ideals, he'll happily burn piles of money to steer Twitter in the direction he wants to. Furthermore, that \"run at a loss in the way I want\" strategy would've been impossible if the company was still public and he was still beholden to shareholders, which is why I think he wanted to take the company private instead of just owning a controlling share in the public company."}

The [Schenck decision]( from which this \"fire in a crowded theater\" business comes from, is a case which justified the censorship and suppression of anti-draft literature. The logic went, \"Shouting fire in a crowded theater presents a 'clear and present danger.'\" and ought to be suppressible -> Passing out anti-draft literature presents a 'clear and present danger' to the war effort -> therefore anti-draft literature ought to be censored. This ruling was overturned by later cases. It is not even in effect anymore. That so many people use this language to this day would be baffling, if I didn't already know that people have never read this case, nor have any inkling what the **\"fire in a crowded theater\" logic was used to do: censor anti-government information in wartime.** All this logic does is create a precedent by which the government may censor *anything it likes* by painting it as dangerous. > For example, falsely yelling \"fire\" in a crowded theater should have consequences. I argue that it would be worth it to suffer people yelling \"fire\" in a crowded theater, so that the government does not use \"harmful speech\" logic to essentially engage in a mass-censorship effort against anything which doesn't promote the state's interest, which is exactly what this logic was used for. > So the question should be, who should be held responsible and accountable: the platform or the individual who created & disseminated the damaging, false information?

I disagree, and the basic historical facts behind this logic are why. > Throughout the 1920s, however, the Court abandoned the clear and present danger rule and instead utilized an earlier-devised \u201cbad [or dangerous] tendency\u201d doctrine, which enabled speech to be limited **even more broadly** than Holmes had allowed. In Gitlow v. New York (1925), for example, the Court upheld the conviction of Benjamin Gitlow for printing a manifesto that advocated the violent overthrow of the U.S. government, even though the manifesto\u2019s publication did not create an \u201cimminent and immediate danger\u201d of the government\u2019s destruction. My position? Twitter is hot garbage and people should stop using it. They should delete their accounts. I would argue that Twitter is bad for society for a variety of reasons, not the least of which is that it encourages infantile thinking, as few issues can be sufficiently explored given the text limit. It rewards the \"zinger,\" while prohibiting substantive discussion of anything important. It turns people into performance artists in a massive demonstration of \"[playing the dozens]("}

Even the CDC is a proponent of UV light to combat COVID which Trump suggested before weirdo Americans freaked out again"}

I'd argue it's the fault of the idiot who did it. Keep in mind free speech isn't speech with lack of consequences. Those guys should be free to spout BS, as free as you are to call them out. When trump kicked out a rude reporter the democrats lost their collective minds and said that trump was attacking free speech. Those same people are saying that maybe censorship isn't so bad, as long as it's not me. And I don't even like trump mind you, he's insufferable. So don't even try saying \"haha seethe trumptard\""}

The only issue with that reasoning that your line is incredibly arbitary and.. troublesome as it ignores the content of the speech completely. &#x200B; \"Specific\" in the context of free speech can only mean \"identifyable by whoever reads this\". Eg. *Bob Builder from Bosten with the adress xxx is a thief* is specific compared to all *bostoners are thiefs.* and this rule makes sense when it comes to a public image or slander in general because it has nothing to do with the person and everything to do with how society would see that person. &#x200B; But you can't use that example with hate speech because it isn't aimed at the general audience but squarely at the receipients/victims of the speech. There is little difference between *bob builder should die (because he is black)* and *all blacks should die.* &#x200B; If you are of the opinion that the latter case should be covered by free speech than slander must be covered by it too unless you think that the only important aspect of a person is how the person is seen by society."}

We all know shouting fire in a theater doesn't constitute free speech, and it's such a weak argument against free speech that I almost don't even want to argue with such a dull person. But I will anyways so you don't accuse me of weaseling my way out. According to your logic it's fine to silence political opposition, and your defense is that we already ban certain thing such as inciting a panic in a crowded area. The difference is that is a call to action. I can't yell \"I hate ericwphoto, I'll pay someone X amount of dollars to do X things to him\" because that's a direct call to action, and that's not protected under free speech. Some moron who says \"the earth is flat and the vaccine makes you magnetic\" isn't making any calls to action, thus is protected, even if no one agrees with him. Would you be so open to political censorship if say someone was banned for saying \"trans rights are human rights?\" I'll bet I know your response, because you don't actually care about intellectual diversity, you'd rather live in a giant bubble where any naughty opinions are silenced rather than debated.

Is it? Silverpush wasn't using some sneaky, underhanded tactics to get access to the microphone without the user's consent, it asked for it, and specifically called out that it was going to listen for advertisements. I'm not sure why Free Software would make this less practical to implement. Beyond that, *none* of this makes any fucking sense, since the title implies that the tone played in each ad would be unique to each TV, which is not how broadcast media works. If you have to send the same audio \"key\" to each cable box then every device is going to hear the same audio key. When every TV playing the football game sends out an ultrasonic \"123\" and every phone that hears it sends \"123\" back to the Silverpush server, Silverpush doesn't know what TV you were next to, just that you were watching it. This tech only makes sense in terms of cross-device correlation for figuring out what internet connected devices a person owns, since in 2014 when this was a thing advertisers were terrified that their marketing was going to be ruined because people were using 2 or 3 separate devices to browse the web, so they couldn't just track everything with cookies anymore. The tech disappeared because Amazon, Google, and Facebook have you logged into your accounts on all your devices anyway, or you're not going to play ball with them and they don't care enough to track you creepily."}

If you were to duplicate your serial you couldn't have more than one cup, or you'd still hit the 30 minute delay. You could scan a few cups in your party and guess at the previous or next serial, they are probably directly sequential, but again, only one of your cups would work depending on who filled first. Your best bet would be to guess at a number that was sold first thing in the morning and hope they aren't still there late in the day. They could also have a key code encoded in, almost like a pin for that cup and if they did, you'd most likely need the protection code to read or write, in which case you'd have to figure that out then figure out the algorithm for generating pins. If you sampled enough cups you could probably figure it out, but the best you could ever do is use cups that were sold that day or steal future cups, in which case they would get to that batch of cups and they wouldn't work anymore. Then they'd look in the logs, look back in their security footage, track you back to the parking lot and you'd be wearing stripes in no time."}

Fiat money \"steals\" value from people with skills and assets who would profit from a gold backed currency. So: - Do you know how to take apart and repair a diesel engine? - Do you have enough arable land to not only feed your family, but also to create a surplus to grow things to sell or exchange? - Do you have any medical skills? Chances are, no, you do not. And before you ask, no, I'm not a mechanic, farmer, or doctor. But I do have all those skills and assets and you are \"stealing\" from me and people like me. The difference is that I don't mind. A gold backed currency would leave me at the same level of comfort whereas everyone else would become poorer, so I would only technically profit. Instead I want people to be happy and have a decent quality of life. Fiat money is a tool that makes it easier to shape a decent and fair society. I understand your point of view where more personal money represents more stuff, and it is legitimate, but please refrain from slogans about how taxes are theft and such, because there's always someone better out there who you are \"stealing\" from."}

I said \"malware-like\" because the technique is very obviously inspired by adware vendors. Around 2005-2015, almost all adware would do spam link injection into random web content they didn't create. This new reddit feature is nearly identical to easily identifiable malware tactics, just baked into a platform rather than infecting your computer. Both are malicious in the sense that it's a dark pattern, and it unexpectedly mangles user-generated content for profit."}

Often, I am endorsing that product or intending for a reader to make a conscious decision -- should they click? Should they not click? Research from 15+ years ago showed that adding these sorts of hyperlinks (bolds, underlines, etc) to a work increase the cognitive load when someone reads the content (they have to think about why it's written differently, and for hyperlinks, they further have to decide whether or not to 'expand' that link); there's also the chance that someone clicks off your comment and never comes back. If that's a video or written work I personally chose to link, I might *prefer* the person go off and read the source. But this? It's \"random\" injections into my written word, which I did not author *and* the reader did not request. If these are external links, there's *no guarantee* that these links *do not* go to literal malware -- many advertising sites *are malware* because ad vendors simply don't vet ads in any reasonable way (nor can they). Ads on youtube, for example, contain content that would get a creator removed from the platform *on the regular.* If it's *not* external links, there's still no guarantee that the link is to the actual concept I'm talking about! For example, say it's subreddits, \"anime titties\" might link to a subreddit, but politics may have been the furthest thing from the mind of the person speaking! I would also like to push back on this specifically: > It's similar to how wikipedia might add links to content you submit.

A user online reported that as a result of updating his machine, it is no longer syncing with apps like QZ, and he is unable to view his machine's exercise metrics in the Echelon app without an Internet connection. (...) >Because updated Echelon machines now require a connection to Echelon servers for some basic functionality, users are unable to use their equipment and understand, for example, how fast they're going without an Internet connection. If Echelon were to ever go out of business, the gym equipment would, essentially, get bricked. (...) >Echelon is in hardware, software, and subscription sales, which makes independently running equipment and apps like QZ potential threats. Yet, it's still vexing to see another example of a company changing the capabilities of its products after people already bought them. Not all Echelon owners use QZ, but many owners may be impacted when the machines lose key functionality if offline. So, in a nutshell - Echelon is using firmware updates to change the configuration of the devices they've already sold into always-online mode, for evidently no other reason than to maintain more control over their brand's gym equipment and to kill off third-party apps made to work with their devices... Is it bad that this only reinforces my belief that firmware updates in general are 99% bullshit? I'm no software engineer by any stretch, but barring stuff like the occasional bugfix, I just can't see how firmware updates are even necessary in devices like gym equipment, printers or tractors. Regular firmware updates... it really does feel like an arrangement that's mainly only there to allow the manufacturer to maintain control over the devices that they sold and therefore no longer legally own."}

A professional artist controls every speck of their canvas; a professional writer controls every word.

As a result, it can be used to create low-value products, or outputs where sheer speed is prioritized over quality, or where it'll be churning out half a million inputs into something that can whittle it down more. Professionals, though, aren't going to use it as anything more than a rough generator on any components of their own works that they particularly care about, and it won't be able to produce genuine top-quality works as quickly as people who actually know what they're doing."}

The company didn\u2019t say there was no data. It said that there was \u201cno relevant data\u201d. The authorities\u2019 reaction left us stunned. We expected prosecutors to push back \u2013 to tell Tesla that deciding what\u2019s relevant is their job, not the company\u2019s. But they didn\u2019t. Instead, they closed the case. >The hackers from TU Berlin pointed us to a study by the Netherlands Forensic Institute, an independent division of the ministry of justice and security. In October 2021, the NFI published findings showing it had successfully accessed the onboard memories of all major Tesla models. The researchers compared their results with accident cases in which police had requested data from Tesla. Their conclusion was that while Tesla formally complied with those requests, it omitted large volumes of data that might have proved useful. >Tesla\u2019s credibility took a further hit in a report released by the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in April 2024. The agency concluded that Tesla failed to adequately monitor whether drivers remain alert and ready to intervene while using its driver-assist systems. It reviewed 956 crashes, field data and customer communications, and pointed to \u201cgaps in Tesla\u2019s telematic data\u201d that made it impossible to determine how often autopilot was active during crashes. If a vehicle\u2019s antenna was damaged or it crashed in an area without network coverage, even serious accidents sometimes went unreported. Tesla\u2019s internal statistics include only those crashes in which an airbag or other pyrotechnic system deployed \u2013 something that occurs in just 18% of police-reported cases. This means that the actual accident rate is significantly higher than Tesla discloses to customers and investors. >There\u2019s more. Two years prior, the NHTSA had flagged something strange \u2013 something suspicious. In a separate report, it documented 16 cases in which Tesla vehicles crashed into stationary emergency vehicles. In each, autopilot disengaged \u201cless than one second before impact\u201d \u2013 far too little time for the driver to react. Critics warn that this behaviour could allow Tesla to argue in court that autopilot was not active at the moment of impact, potentially dodging responsibility. >The YouTuber Mark Rober, a former engineer at Nasa, replicated this behaviour in an experiment on 15 March 2025. He simulated a range of hazardous situations, in which the Model Y performed significantly worse than a competing vehicle. The Tesla repeatedly ran over a crash-test dummy without braking. The video went viral, amassing more than 14m views within a few days."}

I\u2019m sure one in no way led to the other. No one could possibly connect the dots between consumer hardware and commercial machines. One of these groups is being genuine in their desire to protect the consumer. The others are filthy liars. Nintendo just wants to sell more units. Arcade manufacturers barely even concern themselves with such things. I\u2019m glad we cleared that up. Edit: Yeah I\u2019m being sarcastic. I obviously understand how Nintendo opened the door here concerning consumer owned hardware, but I think it\u2019s pretty silly to pretend that was the only door into the building. We had just recently walked through the other. If that metaphor doesn\u2019t do it for you, think of a snowball. The ball picked up a ton of speed and size passing by Nintendo, but it wasn\u2019t where that ball started rolling. We saw all of the other consoles take quick inspiration from Nintendo\u2019s schemes, and I think it\u2019s a little naive to think Nintendo didn\u2019t take inspiration from the other major players in their initially limited field. Disregarding that because there are notably different variables involved seems like a mistake. There are enough similarities to take note. To put it another way - would Stallman say one of these is not like the other? Would he defend early arcade manufacturers but condemn Nintendo? **I don\u2019t disagree that what Nintendo did was worse. Crossing the line into the home is undeniable, but I don\u2019t think we should view that moment in a vacuum as the inception of DRM as a concept.** / sorry for the long edit.

I look at things best I can over longer periods. The articles Wired writes are not \"news\" or informative for the good of all. Even the people that they cite or interview are often of one single political stripe. So yes, you can make the argument that they couldn't have rushed our an article or what not, I don't really care about the day itself, I care about the sweeping surveillance used, the bad actors that hacked and or followed people, the undignified tracking and arrests of people of all ages, and how there was not a single peep about just how authoritarian and creepy it all was. Yes, people committed criminal acts and destruction, etc, so they should have faced consequences for breaking the law. But it still would have benefited everyone and given people a chance to take a step back and ask \"what are we doing? WHEN did all this surveillance come online? We need pushback\". But there was only silence and even now to this day, the only things they wrote regarding it were how events played out and technology was used to track down people and how it might affect other groups in the future when protesting and riots break out. Have you seen such worry and hand wringing with literal political activist groups referenced in any article about general protests? They are quick to decry, challenge and take at face value statements and claims from their political flavouring, but quick to cheer on those same tools and methods being used in those they don't like. And that's why we're all screwed, because people love sharpening swords and never thinking they'll get stuck with one themselves."}

It only gets slightly more ugly and sometimes less usable to me with every update.

The thing is, unless google wants to cut-out samsung, lg, or every other OEM imaginable (god forbid huawei, one of the most sold brands on the planet), they can't get rid of AOSP, as every single one of those flavors of android are built from it. Google would suffer incomprehensibly massive revenue losses damn near overnight. The other thing is, google never said that they are removing the AOSP, they are simply not including the trees for pixel devices in new android versions. While yes, I get that is bad news, the thing is, this REALLY only matters for new devices. For older devices, you still have a tree to work off of (although now it's going to be more of a PITA to work off of). Simply what I'm saying is, for the time being, we will still likely have grapheneOS on pixel devices, but eventually Dan is going to have to move to those grapheneOS devices that he was talking about making."}

Running an open source Android distribution (like LineageOS, GrapheneOS, etc.) on supported hardware gives most smartphone benefits while maintaining reasonable privacy. Most people will simply assume it's just another Android phone - the software running on it rarely comes up in conversation. That said, you're absolutely right about the worrying trend of \"app-ification\". However, I've found that many services still work fine through privacy-respecting browsers + VPN. Yes, you'll hit some CAPTCHAs and \"unusual activity\" warnings, but most legitimate services will let you proceed. The real problem children are the social media giants, especially Meta (Facebook/Instagram) and LinkedIn. These platforms are unique in how aggressively they punish privacy-conscious behavior - we're talking account bans, forced ID verification, and zero human support sometimes even for paying customers. Just look at LinkedIn's biggest subreddit - their bio literally has to include instructions about account restrictions and bans because it happens so frequently! Their \"AI\" is basically just pattern matching that flags anyone who doesn't conform to the herd behavior. If you don't act exactly like their data says you should, you're labeled suspicious and banned. And the ID verification? That's particularly egregious. They demand scanned copies of government IDs - complete with visible edges to prove authenticity - for a social media platform! This level of identification should only be necessary for financial transactions, not social networking. But they know they can get away with it because they've successfully made their platform quasi-mandatory for professional life. Don't comply? Good luck finding a job when companies assume you're either a bot or \"antisocial.\" I've personally settled for a middle ground: I keep a smartphone but: * Minimal app installation (only absolute necessities) * Aggressive permission control * Disabled/uninstalled all possible bloatware * Privacy-focused browser + VPN for most services Is it perfect? No. But smartphones are incredibly useful tools - checking maps when lost, looking up information on the go, or quickly verifying facts. The real battle isn't against smartphones or apps in general - it's against monopolistic platforms that have made privacy invasion their core business model while gaslighting users into thinking it's normal.

But I think we all, including professional software engineers should support people learning, even with AI assistance. I think we mostly understand the limitations - you can't take a bunch of coal minors and get them high paying jobs in software engineering with a bootcamp. You might have a success or two, but on average, median whatever, it can't be done. I think we all understand that AI currently primarily benefits mid/senior level software engineers over total newbies. It is a big boost to productivity but you've got to have the knowledge to figure out why it isn't doing what you want or is doing something you don't want - the author hasn't hit that point yet.
