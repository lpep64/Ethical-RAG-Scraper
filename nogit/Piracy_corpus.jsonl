This is not a one and done solution, I meant this as me pointing out the fact of how easy it is to get tge their media for free distribution purposes (y’know, the entire point of piracy). Not meant to be a “oh I get all my music by stealing off Spotify via inspect element”. B. I have no clue why you guys seem to believe it only uses segments, since I’ve successfully just seen and downloaded entire audio files in the network life provided by Inspect Element. The only reason I’ve come to as to why it could be different is because I use Librewolf and maybe you guys don’t? Not sure. Or because I use Spotify premium (shame me, I don’t care lol). C. Iirc it was mp3, but I could be wrong, haven’t done this in months."}

The new Online Safety Act has just made it illegal to access adult content without age verification — meaning you may soon have to hand over your passport, facial scan, or personal ID just to view art, memes, fanworks, or sexual content online. But it doesn’t stop at porn. This law gives the government and tech companies the power to decide what counts as “harmful” — and block it from you. That could include: • LGBTQ+ stories and expression • Mental health content about self-harm or suicide • Sex education and relationship advice • Erotic art, fanfiction, hentai — anything “they” don’t like They call it “protection.” But it’s control. ❌ It invades your privacy ❌ It undermines anonymity ❌ It opens the door to censorship ❌ It sets a precedent for a surveillance state This isn’t just about porn. It’s about freedom of thought, expression, and access to the parts of the internet that helped many of us survive. We can’t let this slide quietly. SIGN THE PETITION to repeal the Online Safety Act and protect internet freedom in the UK:"}
