I read it in one sitting during a difficult time in my life and it really struck a chord. From there I went to the wider Effective Altruism movement, and to author Peter Singer's arguments regarding animals, two things that have impacted me in a pretty fundamental way. Don't worry if you're not particularly interested in the animal rights stuff, there is whole different Singer book for that! (Animal Liberation, if anyone is curious - another life changer IMO.) This one focuses on effective altruism, or how to do the most good / increase the overall happiness of the planet. It's targeted towards newcomers to effective altruism with no particular background or knowledge needed, but I think anyone can find value in it even if you are already very familiar with utilitarianism and humanitarian causes. This book (and the associated Effective Altruism movement) helped me find meaning amidst an existential crisis & deeply affected my ethical framework. It also changed my life in practical ways such as career choice, volunteering at some amazing places, getting involved in causes I really care about, donating to charity in a much more meaningful & effective way, and meeting like-minded people. It doesn't have to be as dramatic as all that, don't worry, I hapoened to read it at the right time in my life!! If you are interested in utilitarianism or practical ethics you should definitely check it out (along with Singer's other work) but it is written for newcomers with no prior knowledge. If youre curious but aren't sure if it's for you I would still 100% recommend the book, or look up Peter Singer's TED Talk of the same name for an intro to the subject :) There is also a subreddit for Effective Altruism (I'm new, not sure if it's ok to link it) if you have further queries, critiques, thoughts etc :) Sorry for the essay, this is THE book that impacted me the most & I would love for more people to read it, even if they disagree with the ideas (critique is good for any movement/idea, and I think most people will get something useful from the book even jf they don't respond as enthusiastically as I did!) Happy reading <3"}

The giveaway is being run on Amazon and is available to anyone who has a Kindle (or the Kindle App on a smartphone/tablet). The Dust and the Dark Places is a new take on the Western genre, incorporating tropes and traditions of 1800s Dime Novels and mixing them with contemporary themes relevant to today\u2019s society (i.e. strong female characters, the toll of mental trauma). The book tells the emotional and harrowing story of Benjamin Dance and his encounters with Howling Jack Holloway and his gang, the Devilfall Bastard Six. It is a tale of violence, revenge, love and hatred that is driven by a brutal and compelling narrative. Please have a look at the link below and grab a copy if it is of interest to you. I would be grateful for any reviews or feedback you may have of my work as it will help me to write other novels within this genre in the future. (Other links available on request or via Amazon - please use the Buy Now option to get this for free. The Read for Free option is for Kindle Unlimited members)."}

Written by a veteran data team lead and author of *Data Thinking* and *The Operating System of the Mind*, this book takes the principles behind great analytics and translates them into tools for everyday life. You\u2019ll learn to think like a systems designer, act like an optimizer, and structure your thoughts like a high-performance analytical engine. Most people navigate their lives with intuition, habits, and scattered goals, but this doesn't scale in a world of complexity, distraction, and noise. The result? Overwhelm, poor decisions, and a constant feeling of mental fragmentation. This book offers an alternative: a cognitive upgrade. By building a mental architecture inspired by how great data systems work, structured inputs, adaptive feedback loops, mental queries, noise filtering, you can reclaim clarity and become a deliberate, data-literate thinker. You\u2019ll learn how to: * Build robust mental models and decision architectures * Treat your attention as a limited dataset to be cleaned and focused * Construct internal dashboards to track progress and feedback * Balance intuition with structured thinking in real-time * Apply data principles to goals, habits, emotions, and uncertainty Whether you're a product builder, strategist, creator, analyst, or simply someone looking to bring order to cognitive chaos, *The Data-Driven Mind* will equip you to think more clearly, decide more effectively, and build systems that scale with you."}

In **the Contrary Cube**, Jeremy Crowe is invited to a friend\u2019s engagement party, but his reputation proceeds him. He finds a threat from millions of years in the future who look to body snatch the human race. A curious, and gigantic, glass cube holds the key to a thin success or massive harm. While in **Busman\u2019s Holiday**, the recently returned Jacob Crowe is allowed out on a milk-run to pick up a book on auction in London. Much to Abigail Raynor\u2019s chagrin, this simple task quickly snowballs into a race against time against a former Parliamentarian, a secret society of like-minded, but ill-aligned paramilitary scholars, and not one, but three of Cthulhu\u2019s children. Once back home, in **Bug House**, Jacob Crowe, Jeremy Crowe and Abigail Raynor find themselves under siege. After capturing a rare specimen of space bug known as a Mi-go, they compelled to take shelter in a military bunker when an ancient malevolent force throws a tornado at them. Attempting to save itself from being sacrificed to the enemy outside, the Mi-go offers insights on what has been happening outside of Earth. Will this be enough to save it or will the Parliamentarians find another way to broker a peace? And finally, in **Stratford**, we see the early days of Elizabeth Stratford; the ageless sorceress sovereign of the Parliament of Crowe. Thrown into a fight against a resurgent Old One, Elizabeth is forced to reconsidered her place in the world while deciding the fate of thousand, if not hundreds-of-thousand of innocent people."}
