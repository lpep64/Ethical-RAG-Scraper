So now Harp is panicking about their phone, (where we downloaded the apk), because it won't let them touch anything on the screen, and they described it as an ad taht wouldn't let them leave or access anything in their phone. Please if anyone have a solution for this, please, Harp's phpne currently has all of their accounts and school work, this may ruin everything they havw currently. The Apk we downloaded was from ApkVision. I really feel bad for Harp because we pushed them into starting the Zombie survival series, and now we can't fix their phone.. I hope this can also be a lesson for the others who are planning on pirating from sketchy websites.. Update: thank you to the user that commenter about using safemode and rebooting the phone, i honestly don't know how we managed to save it without the power button but it somehow worked and we were able to access the phone but sadly there're still a few ads here and there, but we managed to get the situation under control<33"}

I included some of other resources such as guides as well (although more are needed & will be added) Rest assured though, this thread will be better than the others we've had before. Every app will come with VirusTotal reports and wherever possible, the files are coming direct from the source rather than 3rd parties. There *may* also be a way to request apps to add to the list. Lastly, we focus more on stability & reliability rather than latest versions of apps. For example, some apps listed you might notice aren't the latest version which you will find available elsewhere. This is because we try to go for, and stick to stable releases rather than chase after BETA's (some BETA's are included along with older stable versions). ETA: Maybe a week or two."}

{"id": "oat3qu", "type": "submission", "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ApksApps/comments/oat3qu/tutorial_how_to_modify_apk_files_for_premium/", "author": "bsf91", "created_utc": 1625042639, "score": 469, "title": "[Tutorial] How to modify APK files for premium features", "content": "# Step 0 - Required files [APK Easy Tool \\(Windows only\\)]( - Used to decode, build and sign our APK easily [Apktool]( - Used to decode and build APK files from the command line/terminal [jadx]( - Used to view the Java source code of our APK [SignAPK]( - Used to sign our APK so we can install it on our device adb # Step 1 - Download and decode the APK. Download the Smart Audiobook Player APK from your favourite legitimate APK website. I'll be using [apkmonk]( Next we need to decode/decompile the APK. So navigate to where you downloaded the APK and using Apktool decode Smart Audiobook Player using the `decode` argument. So our command will be `apktool decode ak.alizandro.smartaudiobookplayer_2021-06-06.apk` It will make a folder called `ak.alizandro.smartaudiobookplayer_2021-06-06` which will contain all of the smali code ([the 'assembly' language for DEX files - someone correct me with a better explanation please]( the manifest.xml file of the APK, and all of the resources needed to compile our app back into a working APK file. Note: If you are using Windows you can use APK Easy Tool to decode the APK. # Step 2 - Find what to modify. ^Note: ^You ^will ^need ^some ^programming ^knowledge ^to ^understand ^what ^is ^happening, ^I ^will ^try ^to ^simplify ^it ^though. Okay, now that we have the Smali code, where do we begin to modify the app? Well if you play around a little bit with the app on your phone, you will see that the premium features include adjusting the playback speed, adding bookmarks, boosting the volume and streaming to Chromecast - all useful features. ##So how do we know what to look for? If after 30 days you try and use a premium feature we get a little toast message saying `Your 30 day trial is over. To buy or restore the Full version press: Help`. Okay, that is useful. So open your APK with jadx, and click on the little magic wand icon to open the text search (or press ctrl+shift+f). Now we can search for \"**your**\", the first result should say ak.alizandro.smartaudiobookplayer.PlayerActivity | sb.append(context.getString(R.string.your_30_day_trial_is_over)); ------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------- This looks promising. If you double click that row it will open the PlayActivity file and we can see that the functions code is public static String k1(Context context) { StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder(); sb.append(context.getString(R.string.your_30_day_trial_is_over)); sb.append(10); sb.append(context.getString(R.string.to_buy_or_restore_full_version_press)); sb.append(' '); sb.append(context.getString(R.string.help)); return sb.toString(); } Okay, so this function looks to be making a new string and then returning the string to whatever function called it. So right click on k1 and click `Find Usage`. There is a row that says Toast.makeToast - that sounds like where the toast message is being called. So lets jump to that file. Bugger, there's only 1 line of code in the function called **u1**, all it does is simply display our toast message. That's fine, do the same thing and find out what other function calls **u1**. Okay there's heaps of choices here, so where do we begin? Well lets just click the first one. `ak.alizandro.smartaudiobookplayer.I1` will open. ---- What do we know so far? So far we know that `ak.alizandro.smartaudiobookplayer.I1` has a function which created a toast message in the function called `u1`. And that the string for the toast message was created in the function called `k1`. Simple, so far, right? Okay good. ---- Now, back to the `ak.alizandro.smartaudiobookplayer.I1` file. We land in the middle of some code which is as follows: public void onClick(View view) { if (this.f720c.g0 != null && this.f720c.g0.v1()) { if (this.f720c.g0.c1() != Billings$LicenseType.Expired) { this.f720c.g0.c2(!this.f720c.g0.n1()); this.f720c.I.setActivatedAnimated(this.f720c.g0.n1()); return; } this.f720c.g0.c2(false); this.f720c.I.setActivatedAnimated(false); PlayerActivity.u1(this.f720c); } } This is confusing, even I don't fully get what is happening. But what stands out to me is the 2nd if statement which checks if our license is expired. Looking at the rest of the functions which call **u1** they all seem to appear to do the exact same thing, so this is surely where the full version check is made. Okay, so now if you ctrl+click on the **c1** in `this.f720c.g0.c1()`, then it will open `ak.alizandro.smartaudiobookplayer.PlayerService` and again the function will only have 1 line of code. Again, ctrl+click on the **u()** and it will open another file called `ak.alizandro.smartaudiobookplayer.l`. This function is very simple to understand. I have added comments on what the code does.: public Billings$LicenseType u() { if (w() > 0) { // Check if w() is more than zero i.e. we have donated or purchased a license. return Billings$LicenseType.Full; } if (r() > 0) { // Since we haven't purchased or donated, check if we are still within 30 days of having a trial. return Billings$LicenseType.Trial; } // Disable all of the premium settings. return Billings$LicenseType.Expired; } # Step 3 - Actually modifying the code (the fun part!) Perfect. All we have to do is make sure that w() is more then zero, or at least that Billings$LicenseType.Full is returned. There are a couple of different ways to do this, so lets start with the most obvious. Replacing the value of Billings$LicenseType.Expired; to Billings$LicenseType.Full;. So in your text editor open the file `l.smali`. Search for our function which is `public u()`, which for me is around line 1266. It looks similar to this: .method public u()Lak/alizandro/smartaudiobookplayer/Billings$LicenseType; .locals 1 .line 1 invoke-direct {p0}, Lak/alizandro/smartaudiobookplayer/l;->w()I move-result v0 if-lez v0, :cond_0 sget-object v0, Lak/alizandro/smartaudiobookplayer/Billings$LicenseType;->c:Lak/alizandro/smartaudiobookplayer/Billings$LicenseType; return-object v0 .line 2 :cond_0 invoke-direct {p0}, Lak/alizandro/smartaudiobookplayer/l;->r()I move-result v0 if-lez v0, :cond_1 sget-object v0, Lak/alizandro/smartaudiobookplayer/Billings$LicenseType;->d:Lak/alizandro/smartaudiobookplayer/Billings$LicenseType; return-object v0 .line 3 :cond_1 sget-object v0, Lak/alizandro/smartaudiobookplayer/Billings$LicenseType;->e:Lak/alizandro/smartaudiobookplayer/Billings$LicenseType; return-object v0 .end method If you look at the above code, there are 3 return-object calls, just like our Java code showed. So if we consider what the Java code said, the first return will be full, the second is the trial version, and the third is expired. So what do we change? If you look at each sget-object call they are all the same except for 1 character, the letter after `Lak/alizandro/smartaudiobookplayer/Billings$LicenseType;`. So why not go ahead and replace the **e** in the last sget-object call with a **c** (remember how the Java code said that c is full?) Save your file and now lets recompile it. # Step 4 - Recompiling the code, signing the APK and installing it This is the easiest step, when it works! We will need to modify the AndroidManifest.xml file so that we can install the APK. There is only 1 value of the xml file we need to change, and that is `android:extractNativeLibs=\"false\"` to `android:extractNativeLibs=\"true\"`. Go back to the folder where you decoded the APK, and run the following command to recompile your APK `apktool build .` , once it has finished building it should display the following text: I: Using Apktool 2.4.1 I: Checking whether sources has changed... I: Checking whether resources has changed... I: Building apk file... I: Copying unknown files/dir... I: Built apk... You now need to sign your APK before you can install it. So using APKSigner or your choice of signing software, sign your APK: `java -jar signapk.jar certificate.pem key.pk8 dist/ak.alizandro.smartaudiobookplayer_2021-06-06.apk dist/ak.alizandro.smartaudiobookplayer_2021-06-06_signed.apk` Note 1: Replace the **certificate.pem** and **key.pk8** with your certificates. Note 2: It is easier to use Easy APK Tool if you don't want to muck around with the command line/terminal and you are using Windows. Before we can install the APK, we need to uninstall the original app because our signing certificate does not match the official APKs signature. So using adb run the command `adb uninstall ak.alizandro.smartaudiobookplayer`, or you can simply use your device to uninstall it. Now to install our modified APK, inside the decoded folder run the command `adb install dist/ak.alizandro.smartaudiobookplayer_2021-06-06_signed.apk`. Note: You need to install the SIGNED APK file, otherwise it will not install. # Step 5 - Checking we have access to the full version Open the app on your device, and try and send a book/audio file via Chromecast or adjust and speed of our book. Success! Another thing to check is if you click on the 3 dots in the right corner and click on Help it will say that the version you are using is the Full Version. # Step 6 - Winner winner chicken dinner? I forgot to mention the 2nd way to modify the app. We can force the value of **w()** in `public Billings$LicenseType u()` to be above zero. So reopen the l.smali file and scroll back down to where we modified the code originally. The first check which as you may remember was for the full version is the following code (commented by me): invoke-direct {p0}, Lak/alizandro/smartaudiobookplayer/l;->w()I # Call the function w(). The result will # be an integer. We can tell because of # the I after w(). move-result v0 # Move the value of w() to variable v0 if-lez v0, :cond_0 # If v0 is less than or equal to zero then continue onto the next check. sget-object v0, Lak/alizandro/smartaudiobookplayer/Billings$LicenseType;->c:Lak/alizandro/smartaudiobookplayer/Billings$LicenseType; # Since we are more than 0, get the full license value return-object v0 # Return the full license value So if we look at the comments above, we simply need to ensure that v0 is always above zero, i.e. 1. If we look at [this website]( under the section **Assign a value to the register:** we can see that to assign the value of 1 to v0 we need to use const/4. Our code we need to add to the original function is `const/4 v0, 0x1`. We can replace the request to the w() function, and the corresponding move-result call with our above line of code. Our new function will look similar to this now: .method public u()Lak/alizandro/smartaudiobookplayer/Billings$LicenseType; .locals 1 .line 1 const/4 v0, 0x1 if-lez v0, :cond_0 sget-object v0, Lak/alizandro/smartaudiobookplayer/Billings$LicenseType;->c:Lak/alizandro/smartaudiobookplayer/Billings$LicenseType; return-object v0 *snip* Note: I haven't included the whole function, just the section of the code we replaced."}

So for example, there's a mapping software I use which has premium offline maps. It checks with the server if you are subscribed, and if so it let's you use these premium maps. The app enables/disables your ability to access the map, not the webserver which is queried whether I'm premium or not. Does that make sense?"}

Try it for yourself first, don't be dissuaded. >!An actually hint for you: Search for `ShouldShowStopPanelViewStateHandler`. Search around for where that is displayed.

To answer your question, you don't need a premium account or an active IAP to mod an app. Most of the times the premium features are not server sided and a simple `cont/4 v0, 0x1` can enable the Premium features. That being said, some apps check the server for an active subscription on your account and therefore, they cannot be modded. Such apps include TempMail, FaceApp, VPN apps like Nord, Mullvap, Surfshark etc. As you can probably tell, these apps require a sign-in and that's how they're able to tell whether you have an active subscription or not."}

Usually, the bugs experienced are not exclusive to one person only so it makes sense to have a thread containing everyone's responses and queries. #FAQ: 1. Where Can I Download The Spotify Mod? *You can download the .APK from [GitHub]( by simply clicking on the latest release, then downloading the .APK file located in 'Assets'.* 2. **Why can't I download songs on the Spotify Mod?** *The download feature is a server sided feature and cannot be unlocked in the modded version of Spotify.* 3. **Why do I hear ads when casting to other devices or when using Spotify Connect?** *When casting to other devices or using Spotify connect, Spotify is streaming from their server and not the modded version of the app, so you are likely to hear ads. A possible solution might be to use the native Bluetooth stream from your device.* 4. **I am getting shuffle on playlists! / Premium features are still locked!** *Force stop the application (atleast twice) from the phone settings and start it again. Opening the app, clearing the cache and restarting the phone can also help.* *If you're still facing issues after this, simply uninstall your modded version and download a newer or older release and try again.* 5. **Is Very High Quality unlocked in the mod?** *No. Very High Quality is only visually unlocked in the mod (when you select the option it is actually playing the High Quality version).* *But, the High Quality option is unlocked through the mod, so you can use that for now.* 6. **I can't see the full lyrics when playing songs in the mod** *Lyrics are only available in certain countries.* 7. **What features does the modded Spotify have?** *A full list of features is available withing the xManager app.* #More FAQ's available [HERE]( #Latest Modded Version: [Get it On GitHub]( #Official Support Discussions: xSpotify Support Group - [Telegram]( If you weren't able to find the answer to your question, you can ask here!"}

HORRAAYYY!", "content": "Here's the good answers based on what 2-3 users have said on how to fully block ads on mobile: You have to use both **UBO** \\+ **DNS ad blocking** 1. UBO is \"a **chrome** extension that can block **near all ads** within Chrome or other browsers. UBO **ONLY** works in the browser.\" 2. DNS ad-blocking can block ads that UBO can. This \"includes all apps, games, consoles, tvs, tablets, IoT...anything that connects to the internet. \" DNS ad-blocking **cannot** block all ads \"because some services like Twitch and YouTube serve the ads directly from their own domain\" &#x200B; **So which is the easiest and best DNS ad blocking software + tool to use?** Dunno. It doesn't seem like anyone else knows either. &#x200B; * \"The **DNS server** that you enter in your phone is *not* a code, rather an IP address that points to a DNS server provider. * The job of a DNS server is to tell your phone *where* a particular website your trying to access is located. * The way DNS adblocking works is by telling your device that the ads domains simply do not exist. This works well if you are trying to block entire ads websites. * Often times, mobile apps and games include ads from *other* websites. In this case, ads can be blocked by blocking **those other** websites. * However, in some cases, the website operator may include their own ads in their website. In this case, since the website domain is the same, using DNS **cannot** prevent the ads from showing up. * This is where uBlockOrigin comes into play. uBlock Origin is a [browser extension]( that can block **all kinds** of ads in web pages. * However, Chrome on Android doesn't allow you to install uBlockOrigin. For doing so, you need to use either Firefox on Android, Bromite, or another browser that supports extensions on Android. * \\*\\*Which one is better to use, then?\\*\\* The answer is: both! You'll need to block ads at the DNS level for the games, apps, and anything that can't use uBlock Origin. However, if you don't use uBlock Origin on your browser, you can't use the extended ads blocking capabilities on your favorite websites. Using either without the other is not enough in order to get the **best** ad blocking experience. * What DNS servers to use? There are multiple DNS providers around. AdGuard has compiled a list of known good DNS servers to use: [ &#x200B; \"**So how do you get this DNS adblocking numbers?** 1-You an build your own device called [r/pihole]( 2-You can signup with NextDNS 3-Or you can use controlDNS free adblocking DNS service: **76.76.2.2** but you **can not pick and chose what to block or allow, they make the choices for you** Now put these DNS address in any device settings or directly in your router settings, now everything connected to your router will have DNS level ad blocking.\" This user didn't know how to use rank the options from easiest to hardest. &#x200B; \"Only thing **DNS** does is map **IP addresses** to **domain name**s. All **ad-blocking DNS** does is maintain a list of domain names that are known to serve ads, and instead of providing the real IP it provides an empty result, indicating to the client that that domain name does not exist. Most sites serve ads from **third parties** like doubleclick, and they integrate those links to the doubleclick hosted ads into their main web page, so loading [www.website.com]( will also load content from [doubleclick.net]( When your browser queries DNS for those two domains, DNS will reply with the actual IP for [www.website.com]( and an empty result for [doubleclick.net]( indicating to the browser that that content doesn't exist. The browser handles that by just loading the parts of the page that it can, and leaving the parts it can't empty. The reason this method may not work for for all sites is that [www.website.com]( may decide to host their ads directly on their domain, so both the main content and the ads on the page all come from [www.website.com]( In that case, DNS can distinguish between the two types of content since it all comes from one domain. All it knows how to do it tell you the IP address for [www.website.com]( and if that domain has ads, then those ads will get served. Granted, most sites don't do this, but it's certainly possible. The advantage of UBO in this scenario is that it can not only block all content from domains known to serve only ads, but it can also inspect the HTML and Javascript from the page itself and analyze that for indicators of ads are present on the site. It can actually dig in and modify the page content itself, which isn't possible for DNS based solutions. The real benefit that **DNS** based solutions give is you can use them on devices that you can't install an adblocker on, like Roku and AppleTV. Also, you just set it up once, and it affects every device on your network, so you don't need to find and manage ad blockers for all of your devices.\""}

Download the newest Spotify from Google Play 2. Use [Antisplit-M]( to select the installed Spotify app and convert it into a clean APK file (make sure you stay looking at the Antisplit screen while it's doing the work to create the APK) 3. Use [ReVanced]( to install the patch to the newly created APK file which you will get to via the \"storage\" button in the lower right corner of ReVanced when you're selecting which app to patch. Don't leave the screen while it's working! Be patient. 4. When it's finally done, click install in the lower right corner of ReVanced. You'll get a conflict error about the installed Spotify app, and you will confirm to UNINSTALL it so you can try again (it needs to remove the original Google Play version at this point before installing the modded APK). After those exact steps, I finally had a working Spotify mod. Playlists are loading fine, and I'm not getting that annoying \"premium feature discovered\" garbage when trying to play songs! Enjoy! \\*PS: The way I log in is email and password. I don't know if the other login methods work.\\* **UPDATE: When your Spotify stops working again, delete it and update the ReVanced patches inside the ReVanced app, then start over from step 1 above. That will make it work again until some future update \"breaks\" it again... at which point, rinse and repeat again.**"}

I manually check for them each time because recently if you've seen a guy tried 'beating' the filter which is why auto-mod didn't pick it up and I had to manually delete the post. For example, the word Spotify is blocked and your post will auto delete with a message from Auto-mod but if you try things like Spo_tify or Spotify_Mod then the bot doesn't pick it up and that's exactly what he did. The user that did this post did get a 24hr ban from me for blatantly and knowingly modifying the post title so that it beats the filter. Regarding your point on sketchy links: That's an extremely important point and something I'd like to correct by maybe making a rule stating VT reports should be accompanied with all posts sharing apps. This would mean that if I want to share for example a PicsArt mod, I should provide the VirusTotal report for it along with the link. Lastly, whenever you see those shitty/sketchy links made from bogus accounts, feel free to tag my handle or report the post. I can assure you that I view the reports every single day so I won't miss it. If you have any other suggestions, feel free to shoot us a modmail and we'll consider your suggestion. For now I am going to work on making the rule about VirusTotal reports in an effort to prevent these sketchy sites from posting junk on this sub. Still a few points about this rule that I'm going to check with the other moderators but it's definitely something I'd like to implement."}

Yes. There's 1 app I use a lot which needs you to purchase their premium products, and once it is completed then it send the receipt to their server as your purchase. That works fine, but they don't check what the value of your receipt is. For instance, their purchase check might be (imagine json format, I'm on mobile): `user:bsf9;product:red_car;renew:yearly;receipt:null` And that is valid. As long as receipt has any value. So I made a Python script to give test accounts the premium product, and then a PHP version too. -- I think Lucky Patcher just checks client side purchases.

Only one of them seems to have the same comparison and I changed it from !== to === but that did not seem to work, definitely missing something hmm.. Changes made definitely do have an effect or atleast seem to since I modified some of the strings in the string.json file and was able to get a custom string like \"Hello World!\" to appear on the \"Subscribe Now\" page that pops up. It also changed the string \"Subscribe Now\" to \"SubscribedNow\" without me doing anything which is interesting.. I can't seem to get past that screen that prompts me to subscribe though.

Therefore, you're stuck with older, already modded versions, some of which will work, some of which won't. **Q.** Has anyone else started to mod the Spotify app? **A.** No. No one remotely reputable or trustworthy, anyway, but no one at all to the best of my knowledge or the resources herein. **Q.** Which version should I use? **A.** Almost no one can tell you. It depends on which version you get and what phone you have, and even then, it can work flawlessly one day, and not at all the next. All you can do is try it and see. **Q.** I can't download songs or use voice commands. **A.** You will ***NEVER*** be able to download songs or use voice commands with this app, because those are server side features, which means Spotify servers have to authenticate your user token to use that service, which it can't do for a modded app. Anyone who tells you it can or they have a version that can is lying, no exceptions. **Q.** What if I need to download songs? **A.** Then you need to use Deezer, which has links and instructions in the megathread/sidebar. If following instructions is too complex for you, pretty much everything else here will be, too. Try Beemp3 or something. **Q.** Can someone link me to the app/a working version? **A.** It's in the megathread. If you can't be bothered to click that and look, I don't see how you could be bothered to click your own post and check that. Also, (and this should be common sense, but it clearly isn't) **don't fucking click links people send you**. It's not worth the risk to trust some random stranger on the internet who's promising you free things. Keep it in the megathread. You may be able to find other working versions elsewhere on the internet if you are slightly dedicated, but for the safety of our fellow users, I'm not going to advocate them or recommend any here, especially since I cannot confirm nor deny the veracity of any claims, nor the safety of any other mod. **Q.** Will using modded Spotify get my account banned? **A.** It shouldn't, I haven't personally ever heard of that happening. If you're concerned about it, however, or don't want to share your login on a unsecured app (which is what all modded apps are), make a burner account with a throwaway email (google 10minutemail), and link the playlists from your main account to the burner. If you make any new playlists on it, you can link them back to your main account, as well. That's what I always did, never had a problem. Anything else I missed, feel free to ask below and I will update this with it."}

I can still get sources and links. The main thing is quality of life. I decided to try Real Debrid after a few years of just free modded apps (Kodi, terrarium, Cyberflix, cinema HD, TvZion etc all modded) And Real Debrid is hands down the best thing that's ever been available to me, I never EVER get lags. I can click a 49Gb 4k movie and it'll play instantly and I can jump halfway through the movie and it plays instantly. So that's why I shelled out the few dollars to get it. You can still use the modded versions with Real Debrid. But my favorite and most used app is TvZion. Because TvZion Devs and program leaders are on their game the modded versions will not work, at least for long. I opted to pay the 15$ for a year of the Zion Club. And that was a game changer! But the list of benefits is too long to list. So in short, IF I wanted I could go back to the free version of everything and struggle to find links. But for the Penny's I dropped it's WELL WORTH IT! And I'm sure you have friends, family, rabdoms that would want this set up aswell, charge a small set up fee and boom you recuperated your money from Real Debrid. It's a hell of alot better than paying 120$ A MONTH for cable AND still getting commercials (ads) Rant over."}

For instance A.gray.plugingame.d is a spyware string and a very real catch, considering that the app was adorable home off Mobilism, but when i got adorable home off moddroid it scanned at nothing. And the user i got the apk from off mobilism had a couple different apps show up as virus packets. I already reported the apps, but getting incredibly mad for no reason at people with concerns doesn't change the fact people will still ask. Scanning cracked apps aren't pointless and perpetuating that idea is very harmful, and its how people end up with viruses. User based upload platforms should always be an instant scan, thats a rule of thumb. And besides i was seeing if anyone else had similar experiences (and they did) as thats a huge catch off vt which usually means its bad news. Edit: grammer"}

Everything i said still stands, common sense is the best and safest method, virus total is second. Also, you said all cracked things will show up as virus, but then almost every file from mobilism is 0/ of all the antivirus engines they use, with the minority being a 5/ and rare exceptions being 8/, so it is weird that this one is flagged as 13/ making virus total a good measure on how dangerous an apk may be."}

Tested on cellphone and Chromecast with Google TV. It will force you to update to the Eppi app with no choice to back out. Click on the Install button but choose Cancel on the next screen. If you do update to Eppi your login will likely not work any longer. You will need to uninstall Eppi and reinstall old MFC app through an APK. The VPN is only required for the login. Once in the app, you can disable the VPN otherwise everything will be very slow. Sidenote: Nord VPN currently has a big rebate on its subscription and 100% Rakuten cashback in Canada. It also offers a free trial period."}

Just as a reminder and a tip for everyone, MFC is working fine inBrazil. So, if you want your MFC to work atm, use a VPN and choose Brazil. They also recommend using Proton VPN. I do use Nord here in Ireland. Also, the gold tip for ye about NordVPN if ye are using it... go to Account > Settings > Change the VPN Protocol to OPENVPN UDP. The default NordLynx is pretty slow. =) looks like they are having issues outside BR.. to be fair, they slip the \"company\" in brasil years ago, and now in Brazil they call EPPI Cinema. So, EPPI never worked outside Brazil, like it's happening now on MFC. So, Use the Proton VPN to log-in on your MFC and next time, try another app like YouCine(different app) or WatchList Pro (which is another version of MFC)"}

Article link: Full article text: \"Argentina: Piracy network taken down September 3, 2025 By Colin Mann In a new decisive step in the fight against organised crime in the audiovisual industry, a massive operation in Argentina has dismantled a criminal network with up to 8 million paying users worldwide and a potential reach of over 20 million clients. The operation, led by the Argentine judiciary, involved technical collaboration from La Liga, Alianza, Nagravision, and Telecom Argentina. Additionally, the Motion Picture Association (MPA) is part of the process. \u201cThis operation marks a before and after in the fight against digital piracy in Latin America,\u201d stated Javier Tebas, president of La Liga. \u201cThe scale of this network demonstrates that audiovisual fraud is a transnational organised crime issue. From La Liga, we will continue working alongside authorities, Alianza, and our partners to protect the industry, the clubs, and, above all, the fans,\u201d The investigation uncovered a network of illegal IPTV services distributing audiovisual content fraudulently under widely recognised brands in the pirate market. The raids, ordered by the San Isidro Guarantees Court No. 4, were part of an investigation conducted by the Cybercrime Prosecutor\u2019s Office of San Isidro, Buenos Aires (UFEIC), and took place in four sophisticated office buildings in Vicente L\u00f3pez (Buenos Aires Province), carried out by the Provincial Investigations Police of Buenos Aires (DDI of San Isidro). Among the illegal services dismantled were platforms such as My Family Cinema, TV Express, Eppi Cinema, Weiv TV, Red Play, Duna TV, Boto TV, Break TV, VTV, Blue TV, Super TV Premium, HOT, ONpix, PLUSTV, Mix, Venga TV, ALA TV, Pulse TV, Football Zone, Nossa TV, MegaTV+, Cineduo, Megamax+, GTV, Nebuplus, Onda TV, among others. These fed most TV Boxes in the market, including brands such as Duosat and BTV, with global reach in countries such as Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, and South Africa, among others. Investigations also revealed that the network operated through legally established companies in multiple countries\u2014including Argentina, Brazil, Singapore, China, Colombia, the United States, and Canada\u2014with a nerve centre in Argentina. Associated companies include Valoroso, Space Place Consulting, Goose, BitKernel, Peliplat, and FatFish Media, some of which offered seemingly legitimate services such as Peliplat and Doozy TV. This case is part of a broader international cooperation strategy against piracy led by Alianza and supported by La Liga for years. Recent achievements include: Implementation of dynamic DNS and IP blocking against illegal sites. A court order for the removal of the MagisTV and FlujoTV APKs from Google platforms, which the American company is refusing to comply with. Organisation of the first anti-piracy War Room in Argentina, coordinated by La Liga, bringing together judicial experts, technicians, and audiovisual industry representatives. A coalition with e-commerce platforms such as Mercado Libre, enabling strategic collaboration. La Liga and Alianza reaffirm their commitment to protecting intellectual property rights, ensuring legal access to content, and safeguarding the sustainability of the sports and audiovisual industry across Latin America.\""}

So after hours of trying various things, I was able to get MFC working. You'll only be able to finish your subscriptions then after that you'll need to get EPPI Cinema through this link as MFC has be disconnected. In the meantime I google searched and typed in \"VPN Brazil\" and was able to get a free version. Once I switched the connection to Brazil I could log into MFC and get all my movies/shows back for the duration of my yearly membership. This Brazil VPN is easy to use as it has several Brazil options to choose from. If you choose one and the connection is slow simply switch to another Brazil and go back to MFC. You'll find its very fast. The free version is on a timer so you'll need to log back into the VPN after an hour and go back to watching. If you pay for pro version you won't need to do so for a monthly fee. You can also use any other VPN ie. Nord VPN for a monthly subscription. I have tried logging into EPPI on my phone and added a cloud you can get from YouTube and all my info, saved lists and movies are there. I plan to continue to use MFC for the duration of my membership or until you can't log in anymore or until I switch to EPPI. Feel free to try and see how this works for you. Love to hear from all of you and how you are able to once again enjoy MFC or EPPI Cinema !"}

I think it's because ibis is coded with a whole bunch of references to its package name, so if you only change some of the parts to the new package name it would make the parts that call it's old name, no longer function. Though, I must add that I know nothing about android code and only a bare understanding on code in general, so I am likely to be wrong and so I could be pulling this out of nothing. Anyway, if I'm right, is it possible to add something in the code that, for example, has the program read \"jp.ne.ibis.ibispainty.app\" and tell the code inside just to read it as its original \"jp.ne.ibis.ibispaintx\" I have this thought because you can have a reference in code to make writing code easier. Say you wanted to make a reference to your score system, you could make a reference and call it \"score_sys\" then just use that to reference it Is that possible? I hope I worded that coherently..."}
