Not by choice, but more like lack of time - being preoccupied with work and working on some cool PowerShell based projects. One of those projects which required a lot of effort and understanding of how Group Policies work is GPOZaurr. So today you get to meet it yourself - let me know what you think :-) A blog post about it (to get more details): * [ Source codes: * [ GPOZaurr is a free PowerShell module that contains a lot of different small and large cmdlets. Today's focus, however, is all about one command, Invoke-GPOZaurr. Invoke-GPOZaurr Just by running one line of code (of course, you need the module installed first), you can access a few built-in reports. Some of them are more advanced, some of them are for review only. Here's the full list for today. Not everything is 100% finished. Some will require some updates soon as I get more time and feedback. Feel free to report issues/improve those reports with more information. * GPOBroken – this report can detect GPOs that are broken. By broken GPOs, I mean those which exist in AD but have no SYSVOL content or vice versa – have SYSVOL content, but there's no AD metadata. Additionally, it can detect GPO objects that are no longer GroupPolicy objects (how that happens, I'm not able to tell - replication issue, I guess). Then it provides an easy way to fix it using given step by step instructions. * GPOBrokenLink – this report can detect links that have no matching GPO. For example, if a GPO is deleted, sometimes links to that GPO are not properly removed. This command can detect that and propose a solution. * GPOOwners – this report focuses on GPO Owners. By design, if Domain Admin creates GPO, the owner of GPO is the domain admins group. This report detects GPOs that are not owned by Domain Admins (in both SYSVOL and AD) and provides a way to fix them. * GPOConsistency – this report detects inconsistent permissions between Active Directory and SYSVOL, verifying that files/folders inside each GPO match permissions as required. It then provides you an option to fix it. * GPODuplicates – this report detects GPOs that are CNF, otherwise known as duplicate AD Objects, and provides a way to remove them. * GPOList – this report summarizes all group policies focusing on detecting Empty, Unlinked, Disabled, No Apply Permissions GPOs. It also can detect GPOs that are not optimized or have potential problems (disabled section, but still settings in it) * GPOLinks – this report summarizes links showing where the GPO is linked, whether it's linked to any site, cross-domain, or the status of links. * GPOPassword – this report should detect passwords stored in GPOs. * GPOPermissions – this report provides full permissions overview for all GPOs. It detects GPOs missing readmissions for Authenticated Users, GPOs that miss Domain Admins, Enterprise Admins, or SYSTEM permissions. It also detects GPOs that have Unknown permissions available. Finally, it allows you to fix permissions for all those GPOs easily. It's basically a one-stop for all permission needs. * GPOPermissionsAdministrative – this report focuses only on detecting missing Domain Admins, Enterprise Admins permissions and allows you to fix those in no time. * GPOPermissionsRead – similar to an administrative report, but this one focuses on Authenticated Users missing their permissions. * GPOPermissionsRoot – this report shows all permissions assigned to the root of the group policy container. It allows you to verify who can manage all GPOs quickly. * GPOPermissionsUnknown – this report focuses on detecting unknown permissions (deleted users) and allows you to remove them painlessly. * GPOFiles – this report lists all files in the SYSVOL folder (including hidden ones) and tries to make a decent guess whether the file placement based on extension/type makes sense or requires additional verification. This was written to find potential malware or legacy files that can be safely deleted. * GPOBlockedInheritance – this report checks for all Organizational Units with blocked inheritance and verifies the number of users or computers affected. * GPOAnalysis – this report reads all content of group policies and puts them into 70+ categories. It can show things like GPOs that do Drive Mapping, Bitlocker, Laps, Printers, etc. It's handy to find dead settings, dead hosts, or settings that no longer make sense. * NetLogonOwners – this report focuses on detecting NetLogon Owners and a way to fix it to default, secure values. NetLogonPermissions – this report provides an overview and assessment of all permissions on the NetLogon share. * SysVolLegacyFiles – this report detects SYSVOL Legacy Files (.adm) files. Of course, GPOZaurr is not only one cmdlet - but those reports are now exposed and easy to use. This time I've not only focused on cmdlets you can use in PowerShell, but something that you can learn from and get the documentation at the same time. To get yourself up and running you're just one command away: Install-Module GPOZaurr -Force Here are some screenshots to show you what the command does. Most of the reports have a description, a chart, data, and a solution to fix your issue. &#x200B; &#x200B; &#x200B; Enjoy. If you like my work, I would be grateful for a star or two on Github. Thank you."}

But since we get 10-50 new GPOs every month it's going to be a never-ending story - at least until Tiering model is in place. I've found so much crap in GPOs thanks to GPOZaurr that even thinking about it now makes me proud. GPOAnalysis type provided me information that we deploy certificates expired in the year 1999, that we have 10 group policies all trying to set password expiring for users even tho it's not working.

I spent a lot of time developing it, and the reason I showed it today, is I was afraid spending more time without knowing if there is actually a demand for it. Your response was great! The tool will be developed further, based on your suggestions. This tool is for the community, so I will try to keep it FREE, donation/ad based. The tool is for you, now this is what I would like you to do for me: SHARE this tool with everyone :) Comment here with suggestions, what features from full fledged designers like Visual Studio you would like to see implemented first. I hope to implement most of them, but you need to tell me which are the most important for you :) From comments and messages I gather the priority is: - Tutorial for guys without win form experience - Add click events - Add group and progress bar controls - Add more properties to existing controls The tool will be designed by your comments so feel free to comment :) thanks everybody for suggestion here and by the feedback form on the site, I currently have no time to answer every one but I take note of every single suggestion, keep them coming."}

Stealing/adapting /u/Szeraax's code from below: function Get-CryptoBit { param ($rng) $byte = New-Object -TypeName byte[] -ArgumentList 1 $rng.GetBytes($byte) $byte[0] % 2 } $rng = [System.Security.Cryptography.RandomNumberGenerator]::Create() 1..10 | %{,(1..10000 | %{Get-CryptoBit $rng} | group | sort-object Name) | % {[pscustomobject]@{$_[0].name = $_[0].count;$_[1].name = $_[1].count;}}} You'll see the results are far closer (and it's far slower). The results are quite interesting to plot in Excel/your favourite spreadsheet/chart plotting software. Compare the distribution of numbers from `Get-Random`, `Get-CryptoBit`, and a version of `Get-CryptoBit` with the random number generator re-created each time, rather than created once and passed as a parameter. The thing to google is \"cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator\" if you're interested in what's going on here."}

After a month or so we found our shopping bills had cut down by 40-50% as there was little to no waste due to things that seemed like a good idea when shopping or we just didn't have time to make. This had some issues; we would get duplicates, we couldn't tell which would make enough for leftovers for lunch the day after and most importantly we had to check the recipes for that week and work out a shopping list. This script addresses those issues and generates a (poorly written) HTML page for the menu and one for the shopping list which can then be printed or whatever you need to do with it. &#x200B; A copy of the script can be found here on Github: [ Update the RecipesList.xlsx with your own. *It doesn't do Mondays and Fridays as we don't need these but if you don't go to my mum's house for tea on a Monday or Friday then you can fix this by commenting out lines 172 and 173.*"}

Create a job, put your label into the label field, set a job name, add a \"build action\" with \"run Powershell script\", put some code like 'Write-Host(\"Hello World\")' into the field, leave all other fields empty, click save 7. Run the job 8. Check the job log on the left side and see how your Job was executed on the Node you put into the label field. You can review the status and console log there. A few recommendations: - Don't use the master itself to run scripts for various reasons. - Exchange the Java instance Jenkins delivers with the installer against a 64 bit OpenJDK - Try out other plugins like Artifacts (which allows you to collect file results from the Powershell scripts) - While trying other plugins, remember to delete those you aren't using to keep the instance clean - stick to the least privilege principle for the service account running the nodes I'll attach a guide from Adams Blog in a minute. Edit: Here are two great articles about this. Basic setup guide describing better what I tried above: Guide which shows how and why to use Git for the scripts:"}

Hash tables really are great things to use for a number of reasons (many discussed here) most notably performance and ease of reading (such as with splatting) The funny thing about hash tables, though, is how you create them. > $hash1 = @{} > $hash1.GetType().Fullname System.Collections.Hashtable > $hash1.Add('Tom',0) > $hash1.ContainsKey('Tom') True > $hash1.ContainsKey('tom') True However if you create a hash table like the below you get a different result: > $hash2 = [System.Collections.HashTable]::New() > $hash2.GetType().Fullname System.Collections.Hashtable > $hash2.Add('Tom',0) > $hash2.ContainsKey('Tom') True > $hash2.ContainsKey('tom') False Notice how the key is case sensitive in the second example! Many don't realize this and get hung up on it. When it comes to data that can be identified with a single key they're amazing, but it gets funky when you have data sets that you want to cross reference.

There are several pre-built security baselines out there including baselines from various government orgs and vendors (Microsoft). This tool is specifically for setting a Windows security baseline. Windows ships out of the box with a LOT of insecure default settings. Many of these are either for backwards compatibility going all the way to the NT days or to allow for easy networking/communication for very small businesses and home users. These settings rarely make sense in a corporation and represent significant security risks. Baselines aim to make it easy for orgs to lockdown their endpoint security policies by establishing a downloadable and frequently updated list of best practices that can be quickly applied via scripts/GPOs. One big thing to note is that these are not one size fits all solutions. Different baselines are built with different risk tolerances. There is a balance of security vs. potentially breaking things / dramatically impacting workflows. If you decide to look into this be sure to start with test systems and if a baseline severely impacts a system don’t throw the baby out with the bath water.

Fixing a bad core design takes a lot of effort though so I don't think it's reasonable to expect them to fix that issue. As for the verb, Microsoft has used `Start-WuScan` and `Start-MpScan` in the past so I think calling it `Start-HardeningKittyScan` would have been appropriate. -Quick edit: True nitpicking would be me pointing out that it's called \"cmdlets\" not \"Commandlets\" ;)"}

This approach is going to bring you a lot of pain and if you try to take this approach in a job setting your employer is going to be extremely unhappy. The reason? Powershell is a language riddled with pitfalls. A lot of learning powershell is what not to do and using learning materials and guides are going to point those out so you can recognize the problem fast or spot them in the wild. Additionally, to be a useful scripter there are programming concepts that a person needs to be familiar with. If someone is coming from a background where you've already been introduced to the concepts of scopes, control flow, conditional logic, data types, and maybe more advanced concepts like recursion then that person is already a bit ahead of the game. But if someone is not familiar with these concepts they're going to find themselves stumped quite a bit and learning material does touch on much of these concepts. I can agree that using powershell is a tremendous part of learning it. But trying to dive in without any preparation or a background in scripting/programming is not going to be a good experience at all. Honestly what would be really nice for new learners of powershell is if someone took the time to add to the Exercism track for powershell so that it gets readded to the exercism website: [Exercism course github]( [Exercism]( Unfortunately it was removed due to lack of interest in volunteers to build up the practice exercises. I saw an old bug report mentioning they'd need 10 more added before they'd consider reintegrating it.

But… If you want to write scripts, use functions or pass information from one script to another, you need some sort of class/training on how to use the “programming” features. For me I took an entry level Java programming class, with most likely the best professor I have ever had for a teacher. As I started to dig deeper into PowerShell , I figured out that just about everything I learned in that Java class can be used within PowerShell. This gave me a massive jump in my ability to write in PowerShell…with me eventually teaching myself the concepts I could not fully understand in the class. I still Google a lot of things, but that is mostly to get proper syntax for the commands and stuff like that. To the point of the question, there was definitely a day where I knew PowerShell instead of me just using PowerShell. As an add on from reading other replies here…I am getting on board with the until you have “real world problems” to solve and you use PowerShell to find the solution…you might lear basic commands, will only remember the syntax for the commands you use most often and you will never learn how to put a complex script together. For me , granted I did not have a lot of knowledge to begin with other than knowing how to reserve engineer existing scripts I found online to work for me…which took about 18 months to get that point. But when I got to my job and I was given the freedom to explore finding the solution with PowerShell, I tripled my knowledge over the same time frame"}

Write out each step needed to get that step result only. 3. Flow chart/order those steps. 4. Independently/modularly, complete one and only one thing, to ensure you get the expected results. 5. Rinse and repeat. 6. Then put it together. Just like auto manufactures, home builders, etc. 1. The designer/architect of the knows what they want it to look like, 2. the individual parts teams must do their thing by breaking that into pieces, 3. then the assembly teams put it together. Historically, in our industry, we don't think this way. We write a bunch of code, many times assuming, guessing at stuff, then run it, then try to figure out what went wrong; causing ourselves unneeded frustration, debug, etc. efforts; vs catching the stuff upfront. Once all is done, look back at it to see what happened, what can/should be done, what can/shouldbe optimized; as this is what versioning is all about. Sure this effort takes more time upfront, but, it saves way more on the back end as well as long-term care and feeding. ***Don't try to boil the ocean.*** Know that there is not really much that is new.

To do so, you need to really know how to ask your question, and or break it into its parts, or even ask it wrong, knowing/understanding that you may not find it all in one place, but the pieces in many places. Use tools that will write baseline code for you, then tweak/convert as needed. * ***Don't get ahead of yourself.*** * ***Master the built-in help system and its examples.*** * ***Look at similar things/code, etc., already on your system.*** * ***Don't try to reinvent the wheel (unless you absolutely know it's going to be better).*** * ***If you don't know something, don't guess at it, don't assume. Look it up, or go get training.*** * ***Never expect any other platform/language to be like where you came from, what you've used or like.

I've been kinda wanting to make a public repro for my stuff anyways. Check back in a day or so and I will hopefully post a link to it by then! Edit2: Here is a link to my public repo. As I said I cut things down and split things up to make them more useful in most situations. I don't have a homelab to test this on but it should still work without issues.

Right now Windows comes bundled with 5.1 so if you want something to run out of the box that's the version you have to target. If they bundled 7.5 with Windows 12 or whatever then that just raises the minimum version you need to worry about to that level. Windows used to do this with every major Windows release (7 came with 2.0. 8 came with 3.0 and so on) they just stopped because of product support policy reasons. I understand the worry about a potential slowdown in the pace of updates but we don't know if that would actually happen (they haven't indicated that in this post at least). If it did happen, I'd say it's still worth it because being stuck on the old .NET framework and C# 7.3 for the inbox version means developers will be less likely to develop something for it. Right now if you are a C# developer that wants to develop a CLI app you have 3 options: 1: Develop a .NET standard 2.0 PowerShell module that is easy to get in the hands of your end users. 2: Develop a new PowerShell module explicitly built for 7.4 that can utilize all the latest .NET and C# features but end users have to install PowerShell 7.4 before installing your module. 3: Build a traditional console app using the latest .NET and C# features and distribute it with WinGet. PowerShell includes a bunch of nice features that saves the developer time in implementation because PowerShell can handle it for them (importing/exporting data in various formats, tab completion, parameter validation, etc.) so a PowerShell module is very appealing option if you know about it. It's just hard to justify working on an ancient version of .NET or making it difficult for users to install your app."}

This concerned a simple piece of PowerShell code, you type in your email address and the OU site you wanted queried and it sends you the group member list of the AD Groups in that site via email. There's no read me file. The people who need it know how to use it. It's used by the security auditors to make sure the right people in that site are in the right OU's. The scripts are in a group folder that are available to management at the company.

This really surprised me as I had not touched that code in over three years and it was used quarterly by the security auditors. I had built in logging that dumped results into a separate file folder only available to IT so that was my first stop. The first part of the SiteReview.log file was typical, my early tests and past security output ; so I slid down to the more recent time / date stamps.

Had a CS degree from the 80s I think but worked as a sysadmin. A lot of our automated processes ran on his code, whether it was batch, VB, Perl, and I think he even dabbled in C#. When I joined the team I encouraged him to look at Powershell and he went down the road of converting most of \"his\" scripts to PS. I considered him a friend, but his code was actually kinda terrible. Not that it didn't work - it did, usually - but it followed none of the practices Adam discusses here. No functions, no parameters, entire blocks of code copied & pasted into multiple scripts, hardcoded paths... But because he took 'ownership' of these processes nobody held him accountable for years and there was no incentive for him to improve his code. That's a management issue for us, I'm aware, but my point is that good code is a gift to your team and it ultimately benefits the organization. The subject of my story has retired now and I and another new person have the task of untying the knots that he left us. We discovered a problem in a provisioning script, a block copy/pasted from another, that was the root cause of the CEO temporarily losing his security access. Big screw up. We fixed it but the incident showed us just how bad the situation is. I think we who work in IT ops often don't see a need to \"beautify\" our scripts because we have a \"get it done\" mindset. If it works, etc. That's good enough for management. This is also why there's stagnation and resistance to DevOps as a cultural change. My team is a long way from maturity on that journey but I feel that taking pride in creating high quality reusable and robust Powershell is a good place to start. It's my hope that embracing this grassroots shared value of code craftsmanship will take us further down that road, leading to us adopting source control, deploying infrastructure and configuration as code, and adopting other dev practices. None of this depends on management, we will do it ourselves. Maybe I'm too optimistic but it's my intention."}

I had been avoiding touching this thing because it was 6k lines. Extremely well documented internally, but basically for each scenario he just popped in the full json to make it happen. So if we wanted something done to a prod environment here's 30 lines of json for prod and next will be the full 30 lines of json for dev. Repeated over and over to handle all our scenarios. All the REST calls with the API itself had been given functions but creating the payloads appears to have been a straight copy paste affair. I picked out the parts of the script that are actually necessary to change for our use case, wrapped everything up in some loops and switches and consolidated it down to 1200 lines. Feed it a list of conditions you want built and the script parses all the info we needed from the list, builds the required json from a few templates, and pumps it through their API. If I need to change something later on all the actionable code is in one place and I don't have 20 sections I'd need to find/replace my change into. I really like the guy I replaced, knew him outside of this job, but he has left behind a legacy of so many crazy long and repetitive scripts that are such a pain to update."}

By the end of the 25 minute meeting I had 20 lines of PS that extracted the relevant table into a csv file for a single document and by the end of the day I could loop through the entire 4700 documents in about an hour and have the data in an excel document.

The blog is free, it has no ads, it doesn't cost anything except my time to prepare it and money to host it. Summary blog posts with description/screenshots and links to sources: [ Here's a list of +-40 PowerShell Modules I've created over the last 2 years. There are modules that provide a full spectrum of options for anyone interested: * Active Directory Functions * Word creating/reading * PDF creating/split/merge * HTML creating without zero HTML/CSS/js knowledge * HTML parsing * RSS * SIEM, Event Logs * Microsoft Teams * Discord * Lansweeper And many others. As PowerShell is no longer Windows only some of those modules work just fine on Linux and macOS. Usually, PowerShell 5.1, PowerShell 6 and PowerShell 7 are supported if the underlying .NET provides that option. All those modules are free, fully open source. * In 2018 I've written 21 of them * In 2019 another 20 In 2020 I plan to reduce the number of modules integrating some of the stuff together, however, it's possible new ones will be born. &#x200B; |Name|GitHub Stars|Download CountTotal|Download CountLast|Releases|Releases (2020)|Releases (2019)| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |[ADEssentials]( |[Connectimo]( |[Dashimo]( |[Documentimo]( |[Emailimo]( |[Excelimo]( |[Graphimo]( |[LittleInfrastructureManager]( |[PesterInfrastructureTests]( |[PSAutomator]( |[PSBlackListChecker]( |[PSDiscord]( |[PSEventViewer]( |[PSFreshService]( |[PSLansweeper]( |[PSManageService]( |[PSMyPassword]( |[PSParseHTML]( |[PSPasswordExpiryNotifications]( |[PSPublishModule]( |[PSPulsewayManager]( |[PSSharedGoods]( |[PSTeams]( |[PSUnifi]( |[PSWebToolbox]( |[PSWinDocumentation]( |[PSWinDocumentation.AD]( |[PSWinDocumentation.AWS]( |[PSWinDocumentation.AzureHealthService]( |[PSWinDocumentation.DNS]( |[PSWinDocumentation.O365]( |[PSWinDocumentation.O365HealthService]( |[PSWinReporting]( |[PSWinReportingV2]( |[PSWriteColor]( |[PSWriteExcel]( |[PSWriteHTML]( |[PSWritePDF]( |[PSWriteWord]( |[Statusimo]( |[Testimo]( &#x200B; As I don't have too much place here to provide a full overview of it here I do encourage you to visit blog post I wrote that covers in the summary which module does what and how you can use it.

Those things do so much more than what you're specifying, and your way is very limited. Yeah, it's a quick way to spit out just that property, and a good way to make it no longer be a property. But you can't use it to spit out more than one property. You can't make it keep the \"parameter wrapper.\" And it requires either knowing that you're going to do this before you start typing the line or you have to go back and edit the beginning of the line. Plus, you are using a shortcut just so you don't have to do | select -expand <prop>, but you're using where-object the hard way. This does the same thing without all the extra special characters, and without needing to know exactly what you're going to do before you start typing: Get-childitem C:\\ | ? name -like \"program*\" | select -expand fullname If you do this: (Get-childitem C:\\ | ?{$_.name -like \"program*\"}).fullname And then decide you need the attributes, or the root, or just the name, you can't just up arrow and tack on those things and keep going."}

Most of these are written by me and built around real-world needs I’ve come across. These scripts cover a wide range of tasks, including: * Bulk license assignment/removal * M365 user offboarding * Detecting & removing external email forwarding * Configuring email signatures * Identifying inactive or stale accounts * Monitoring external file sharing in SPO * Tracking deleted files in SharePoint Online * Auditing mailbox activity and email deletions * Reporting on room mailbox usage * Exporting calendar permissions * Checking Teams meeting participation by user * OneDrive usage report * And lots more... Almost all scripts are **scheduler-friendly**, so you can easily schedule them into Task Scheduler or Azure Automation for unattended execution.

Example is included in the [release]( as well as on the repository page. I also decided to include example scripts in the release, so you won\\`t have trouble when adapting ypur scripts for the application. For myself, I divided scripts by the purpose for each separate tab. Each tab has buttons in it attached to my scripts. To execute necessary script I just press the button. Use cases: So for example, there is one configuration file on web server. Occasionally developer responsible for that web service asks me to get actual production config file from the server. To give him that file, I just open necessary tab in the application, and press the necessary button. My script binded to that button executes, and gets config file from the server, puts it on my desktop and then sends it via email. Another example. There is a Windows Service on one of our servers, which is responsible for execution of some high impact tasks. In rare occasions it can stop work properly. So to fix that, I just created script which connects to that server, cleans some files, and then starts back service. So when problem happens, I just press the button in the app and problem is fixed.

What really made me happy is that I just started learning powershell. I'm currently reading \"Learn Windows PowerShell in a Month of Lunches\" and only at chapter 8. I was given an excel sheet with about 350 user who I needed to update the job title and their manager. I immediately realized that I could create a script soemthing with powershell to have it done in one go. I used get-help on every single lines. Google the shit out of it and had to troubleshoot by excel document. Whoever build that list made it really hard to automate. First they gave a column with the name of the user: Lastname, FirstName They also gave me the name of the new manager: FirstName LastName or FirstName, LastName or Lastname, FirstName It was quite a puzzle but in the end I managed to modify the excel sheet to order the names to use the displayname to find them in AD and by creating a new column using the first letter of the first name + last name of the manager to use as username and update the parameter -manager. Wasn't easy, but its only the beginning!"}

However, if you follow the article to the letter but get \"access denied\", see my [post]( My comment with the recommended change came from a support ticket open with Microsoft. Secondly, if you're doing event forwarding you may want to look into breaking up the forwarded events into [custom event channels]( We had one type of event which occurred a couple times a day. The other would occur several times per second. Multiply that by a dozen domain controllers and you get a flood of events. It would basically filter out the rarely occurring event. Custom event channels will separate out each event into its own folder. In my opinion, it's pretty shortsighted by not making this a native functionality. Oh well."}

Something like this: using namespace System.Management.Automation class Error { # ---------------------------- General ---------------------------- static [ErrorRecord] URINotSpecified([String]$Exception,[String]$Details) { $Exp = [System.ArgumentException]::new($Exception) $ErrorCategory = [ErrorCategory]::InvalidArgument $Error = [ErrorRecord]::new($Exp, 'URINotSpecified', $ErrorCategory, $null) $Error.ErrorDetails = $Details return $Error } # ----------------------- Get-SecretAPIPath ----------------------- static [ErrorRecord] GetSecretAPIPath([String]$Exception,[string]$Path,[String]$Details){ $Exp = [System.Management.Automation.ItemNotFoundException]::new($Exception) $ErrorCategory = [ErrorCategory]::ObjectNotFound $Error = [ErrorRecord]::new($Exp, 'GetSecretAPIPath', $ErrorCategory, $Path) $Error.ErrorDetails = $Details return $Error } } Which you use in a function like this: function Get-Foo { [cmdletbinding()] param() $PSCmdlet.ThrowTerminatingError([Error]::URINotSpecified('The Exception Text','The Description Text')) } function Get-Bar { [cmdletbinding()] param( [string]$Path ) $PSCmdlet.ThrowTerminatingError([Error]::GetSecretAPIPath('The Exception Text',$Path,'The Description Text')) } (Long ass output example at bottom...) It makes it very easy to quickly reuse the same errors across multiple functions and keep everything consistent. Also keeps the error logic within the functions short while still using the full method elsewhere (the class.) You can also combine it with localization and instead of passing the actual strings you would do something like: `$PSCmdlet.ThrowTerminatingError([Error]::GetSecretAPIPath($LocData.ErrorGetSecretAPIPath_NotSet,$ConfigFile,$LocData.ErrorGetSecretAPIPath_ErrorDesc))` Which would draw the error text from `en-US\\Module.Localization.psd1` or however you have it set up.

If you wait for a few months, you might find it at a library somewhere, at least if you live in an area with libraries with a good selection of Computer books. The online help available these days is a lot better then it was when the first Month of Lunches book was available, so you might not need or want it. I think for some people the Month of Lunches style structure worked really well as a way to learn something Powershell. Do you need it, or does everyone need it, probably not. There are demo chapters, or as I mentioned there may be older editions at the Library, so you certainly look before you spend anything."}

I've caught myself a few times where I've configured 4 out of 5 Domain Controllers thinking everything is running great. While there are \"pay\" tools on the market I've usually no budget. And when you search for Active Directory Health Checks you can find a lot of blog posts covering Active Directory Health Checks. However, everyone treats every health check separately. If you want to test 20 different things you're gonna spend next 8 hours doing just that. And when you're done you should start all over the next day because something may have changed. I wrote a PowerShell module called Testimo which bundles a lot of Active Directory checks and make it easy to expand on. It targets Forest/Domain and all it's Domain Controllers. It has reporting built-in. It's able to work ad-hoc to asses someone else directory and find what's misconfigured, but also has advanced configured which can test your AD against given specific settings. Following \"health\" checks are added for now. I do intend to add more as I go. It's quite easy to add more sources/tests so if you wanna help out - please do. Of course, I may have done a few misconfigurations, some errors while putting it all together - so make sure to let me know via GitHub issues if you think some settings are incorrect and should be

Our DCs were set up correctly and only some minor tweaks to policies have been needed in the last 6 or 7 years.

It also does remoting fairly well, even though it's a bit more of a pain to set up compared to SSH remoting on *nix systems. Unlike most other shells, it operates on rich objects rather than simple strings, making handling data simple. It's built on top of .NET, which means you can use any .NET library natively. Its syntax is fairly similar to C#, with some sane choices (e.g. using backtick as an escape character). It can easily communicate with WMI/CMI, giving you access to a lot of things (configuring and querying Windows data, configuring SQL Server components, etc) It provides modules to handle AD, IIS, etc. It exposes certain parts of the system in a file-system hierarchy (Registry, IIS, certificate store, ...) Several technology stacks provide PS modules (e.g. AWS) It's also a quite capable daily driver shell (I've been using it for several years now) - there are lots of useful modules (git, command line editing, command history, etc). In a nutshell, if you're doing any sysadmin-y or DevOps-y stuff on Windows, PS is the way to go."}

The growth is in percentages; if you have $0.01 and get $0.02 you get 100% growth! If you have $1000 and you get $1001 that's ten times more increase, but only shows as 0.1% growth. Small things grow faster in percentage terms, because they are small; Python is enormous, a bit of growth percent in Python usage probably translates to a HUGE number of commits. Growth in PowerShell probably translates to a much smaller number of commits. That said, I have no idea what could drive a big boost in PowerShell use on Github, and would be interested if anyone knows of large new projects using it or moving tools to it. > It had seemed to me that Microsoft had largely given up on Powershell. The PowerShell team is currently pushing changes to the language to get C# developers more interested in using PowerShell for build pipelines and tooling, but that's a bit recent to be causing lots of C# projects to suddenly push .ps1 files to Github in large numbers."}

With Powershell 6, a lot of capabilities were lost since it depending on .Net Core. That meant that many administrators kept using 5.1 as their daily use shell. The Azure Powershell modules continue to go through rewrites or rebranding that can make things frustrating as well. On the strict PowerShell side, 7 is alleviating a lot of issues that 6 had and should make for a smoother transition for administrators. With the announcement of 7 was also a clarification on how support would roll out for Powershell from now on, effectively mapping closely with .Net development in the future. For many Microsoft products, Powershell is a much better management tool than anything else offered in terms of both options and scalability, so many administrators are growing their toolset around Powershell and sysadmins are starting to understand the need for source control more as their dependency grows on Powershell."}

This way you can force and guide users of your script to fill in the correct values. * Try and split up your tasks into smaller functions, eg Create-ADAccount, Copy-SharedMailbox, Copy-O365Group etc, and refer to those. This can make the tools reusable and optimize the functionality/performance of your scripts * Look into splatting for example for the creation of your New-ADUser. Does nothing better on functionality, but increases readability Good job!"}

But now the 15-20 seconds is too long for people to wait, which is the reason I'm posting here. I know I am probably doing several things very inefficiently. Most actions are repeated 12 times (once for each site) which gives the script its length. Also the meraki api can handle up to 5 api calls a second. I'm only running one at a time. If anyone can point out what my inefficiencies are, and can offer me any guidance on making this script more efficient, i'd greatly appreciate it! Here is what it basically does (not every step is listed, these are the majors things) 1. Gets mac address from text file (another program puts it there) 2. Connects to api to check if mac address is present on site networks **x12** ( once for each site, as each site has a unique api connection it has to do) 3. writes the results to a text file x12 4. references text files to get the mac of AP it connected to x12 5. gets unix time of last connection x12 6. goes through process of changing unix time to normal time x12 7. reconnects to api x12 (this time to get access point info and not device info) 8. goes through process to get the name of AP x12 9. throws it all into a pretty html table that tells us the last access point it connected to and the time of the connection Here is a link to the script - [ Edit: Thank you for all the help I’m getting!

(caching all info to local storage, and interrogating that local storage accomplishes this) - But rule #1 of optimization -> Measure before you optimize. Record times at interesting places, and use that to help confirm your intuitions about what is slow before you go making a mess for no reason, or even end up slowing things down. To give a sense of impact, I have a script that used to take on the order of 40 hours to complete, since it had to make Google API calls for most users and groups. The most significant change I made was instead of having the script do the simple/direct thing of looking up info as it needed it, it would start by taking a few minutes to download the entire userlist and entire group list. It would then store that in a hashtable, and anywhere I used to do a Google API call, I'd just pull from the hashtable. A single page of listing could carry 500 users in it, so that saved 499 other round trips... (though more data was transmitted, and I had to process much larger data objects) Runtime went down to around 15 hours. It interacted with group members as well, so I did similar pre-caching magic (where I could get full membership of 90% of groups quickly). The trick here was that I could use the batch api to get up to 200 members for a group, but a single call could handle 10 or 20 groups at a time. Now even though the \"prep\" phase of the script takes around 45 minutes, the whole runtime came down to just over 8 hours. Only now did local optimization start to matter (and you'll want timestamps on output so you can measure actual speed)... so I looked at what was called most often, and started either unrolling it (if it was a super-simple function, I just removed the function and duplicated what the function did... function calls are relatively expensive). And for the code that processed the much larger data objects, I converted them to C#. I also wrapped write-verbose and write-debug commands inside of code that checked the current verbose and debug status... checking status is much faster than calling those functions. Runtime is around 3.5 hours now. EDIT: To clarify... the only times I looked into unrolling functions or going to C# was for things that were used in the middle of very tight loops... where it was going to get called hundreds of thousands of times. Then I measured. If it didn't save a real usefully significant amount of actual perceivable time, I left the slow code in place. Being able to read the damn code and have a clue what it does in 6 months is important. (Future you is a completely different person from current you, and will have next to no idea what you were thinking)"}

Today you get 4 cmdlets: * Get-WinADGroupMember * Show-WinADGroupMember * Get-WinADGroupMemberOf * Show-WinADGroupMemberOf Get cmdlets display group membership in console so you can work with it as you like. They show things like all members and nested members along with their groups, nesting level, whether group nesting is circular, what type of group it is, whether members of that group are cross-forest and what is their parent group within nesting, and some stats such as direct members, direct groups, indirect members and total members on each group level. This allows for complete analysis of nested group membership. On top of that the Show commands display it all in nice Table that's exportable to Excel or CSV, Basic Diagram and Hierarchical diagrams making it super easy to understand how bad or good (very rarely) nesting is. They also allow to request more than one group at the same time so you can display them side by side for easy viewing. And on top of that they also provide Summary where you can put two or more groups on single diagram so you can analyze how requested groups interact with each other. &#x200B; In other words - with one line of PowerShell you get to analyze your AD structure in no time :-) Here's the blog post: [ Sources/Issues/Feature Requests: [ &#x200B; Enjoy :-) &#x200B; &#x200B;"}

The greatest benefit is that Nexus servers can proxy their connections to each other. You can have an internal repo where you can upload your packages, and then use a cloud service to create your own CDN. I used two Azure VMs one in West and one in East. They were spokes to a hub where an Azure Firewall protected everything egress. The Nexus repos proxied their connection to our on-prem Nexus server that was only exposed via an F5 load balancer in a DMZ. This allows for a single source of truth, and the ability to push out packages to machines regardless if they were on the corporate network or not. Then we used PDQ or SCCM to simply run the proper install/upgrade script. It worked wonders and it really saved us once the pandemic hit!"}
